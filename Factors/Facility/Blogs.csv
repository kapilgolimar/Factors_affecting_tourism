The Puppy that stole my heart
I was visited by angels. Really. I was alone, feeling helpless, approaching panic. Then they came, the two young men, and they didn’t leave until things were right.

“We’re just people,” they insisted. Nope, angels, no doubt about it.

It all had to do with the puppy.

I had been visiting the puppy with the hurt leg for about five days. Every morning, after walking around the shady coolness of Lady Doak College, I would step into the noisy world outside and walk a short ways up the street. The puppy would be crumpled somewhere in a dark, safe place, and when it walked, it held its rear leg aloft and hobbled instead. His eyes carried pain, and the first day when his leg was freshly injured, he whimpered when I scratched his chin.

His mother, a dirty white skinny thing with milk heavy underneath, approached and allowed me to scratch under her chin. Her cinnamon colored eyes closed, and sometimes she leaned her forehead into me and just stood, feeling my touch. Human touch that she rarely experienced.

One day I watched a man with a shiny tiffin pail walk by. His face was all
Mother and Pup with hurt leg
smiles as he tossed biscuits to the mother and a male dog. That male dog growled at me the first time I saw him, so I never touched him. But he was always around, sitting on the street edge near the mother. When the happy man tossed biscuits, he and the mother waggled their tails, and followed him, watching for more flying biscuits. The man patted the mother on the muzzle—but it wasn’t really a pat, it was more like a slap, and she closed her eyes and lowered her head. Maybe she was just grateful for any human touch.

The day before the angel visit, I found the puppy with tail wagging. He was hopping and bouncing and playing with some strands of something. His leg was feeling better, and he was trying to be a puppy. Mom appeared and stood for chin scratches.

“Hello,” I said. “You’re a good mama.” The puppy suckled as I scratched.

But yesterday as I approached, the mother saw me then howled. And howled. I moved closer, and she jumped on me. This was strange behavior, I thought, I had only given her affection, so why was she howling. Something
Two Angels: Saruhasan and Gokul
was not right. “Let’s sit on this bench,” I said as she hopped beside me. “Where’s your baby?”

I looked for him in the drain hole underneath the walkway. As I moved closer, I saw just one thing. Red. Bright crimson red. He raised his quivering head, On the top, where the white furry stripe use to be, was a big gaping hole. His white skull was exposed in a spot bigger than a quarter, and was rimmed by pink flesh. The blood oozed.

“Oh no, oh no, oh no no no. Oh my gosh, what has happened?” The pup looked at me with glazed grey eyes. His whole body shook. I rested my hand on the trembling. He was just healing from his hurt leg, and now he had a fresh wound, and his life was streaming out of it. I flashed on a long painful death—infection, shock, sepsis, maggots crawling. I shook my head.

A foreigner in India, that’s what I was, who had become attached to street dogs. Flies hovered, several landed on the raw flesh, and I brushed them away. The mother stood next to me. Save my pup, she said. Do something,
Almost done--good pup
she said. Help him, she said. She licked the oozing blood.

Could I walk away? No. Could I scoop him up and take him somewhere? Where? What to do? I called Jeeva, the young woman whom I had told about the puppy earlier. “I don’t even know if he’s going to live. He’s trembling. He’s suffering. Oh my gosh, what should I do?” She would try to find the phone number of a rescue organization in Madurai. I phoned my homestay host and briefed him. He said he would send the number of a rescue organization also.

I sat there, hand on the puppy, feeling powerless and so sad for this animal with no name and no home. He tried to lift his small head, but finally just put it down. People walked and drove and bicycled by. Some gave us a glance, all looked away. They had seen this situation all too often. What could they do? It was just another injured street dog.

They don’t want me to call them angels, but suddenly they were there. Gokul and Saruhasan were real and solid, sitting on a motor scooter, looking with concerned eyes at the puppy
Saruhasan loves dogs
and looking at me with my hand on the suffering young dog.

“What happened?” I shrugged and said I’d just found him this way; he was okay yesterday.

“There’s a hospital about three kilometers from here.”

“With a veterinarian?”

“Yes.”

“Well, could you take him? I’ll pay for it.”

“Yes, we’ll take him. And the treatment is free—it is a government hospital.”

I threw my arms up to the heavens and cried out, “Thank you‼”

Angels, they were. Angels.

What would happen to the puppy afterwards? Would I need to take him? Saruhasan said he would take the puppy to his house after treatment, care for him during recovery, and look for an adoptive home for him.

This was not the first time they had done this. They assured me that they love dogs, and they’ve rescued many from the streets. This is what they do.

They found an auto rickshaw. As Saruhasan, the puppy with the hole in his head, and I drove off, I looked at the mother with the soft cinnamon eyes standing there, watching us. She knew. She knew things would be alright for her
Mom!! Reunited...
puppy.

“I love dogs,” Saruhasan assured me again.

While at the animal hospital, I learned more about these young angel-men. Saruhasan earned a degree in computer engineering, and Gokul earned a degree in electrical engineering and is studying for a masters degree in business. They searched for jobs for a year in Chennai, and Saruhasan found work for several months, but both wanted to pursue projects in social services. They returned to Madurai, where they started planning.They’ve just recently established a trust to help all kinds of animals—dogs, cats, cows, goats—and to help educate people about animal care. But they need additional funds to support their efforts. Their enthusiasm and commitment seemed so strong, I knew they would contribute much goodness to the world.

The veterinarian examined the puppy, and cleaned and sutured the wound. Saruhasan held the pup during the painful stitches, while Gokul went outside so he wouldn’t hear him cry, even though he had received an injection of anesthetic. The doctor was kind enough to allow me to photograph him and his assistants at work on the pup. Twenty minutes later the hole was stitched shut, a bandage soaked in antiseptic covered the wound,
Mother and Pup visit
and the pup was released.

Later that evening I met Gokul and Saruhasan. They brought the patient, who looked like a new dog, to reunite with his mother for awhile. When I saw her on the street, she immediately knew me and jumped up to greet me. I kept assuring her that her puppy would be alright, and she would see him very soon. She sat with me for a long time, until her baby arrived via motor scooter. He could not drink enough of her milk, it seemed, and she appeared excited to see him.

The two angel-men, Gokul and Saruhasan, petted the mother and watched the interaction.

“She doesn’t get love here,” Gokul said of the mother. “All she needs is love.” She closed her eyes as he rubbed her head.

Gokul and Saruhasan of Madurai are true angels to the animals of this city.

And they are angels to the foreigner who grew attached to a street puppy and his mother.

Hi this is my first blog.



My name is Achyuta Ramakrishna belongs to Telangana.



I want to mention the details about the journey we went in April 2016.



I joined job in March 2016 in CHENNAI. My family wants to go any place in April because we had fed up with the routine things happened in our lives so far for 2 years. They told me to make a trip to any of the place. Then i planned to go Madurai - Rameshwaram - Trichy - Tanjore trip. So immediately i have booked the train tickets, hotels and retiring rooms. I made whole trip in 2 days. Though it was a little hectic but we got so much relax.



14-04-2016 Thursday



My parents started their journey in GRAND TRUNK EXPRESS from KHAMMAM - CHENNAI. They packed all the things and started their journey towards chennai.



15-04-2016 Friday



By 6:30 AM they reached chennai central. They were new to chennai by that time and I could not met them by that time because of the office timings. I booked a cab for them to reach Egmore railway station. I booked a hotel in-front of railway station. Within 20 min they have reached the hotel and started the fresh-up activities. I booked a train from chennai to madurai (Nellai Express) which leaves the Egmore at 8:10 PM. I thought that they will take the rest for whole day because the next 2 days will be hectic schedule, but for my astonishment they booked a car to go KANCHIPURAM. They started at 9:00 AM from Chennai and visited the 4 important temples in Kanchi and came back to hotel by 4 P.M.



I finished all my office works by 4 P.M. and asked permission leave early by 5 P.M. (instead of leaving at 6 P.M. usually) and I started my journey to Egmore. I have been living in a place which was 22 K.M. far from Chennai EGMORE railway station. I met my parents at 7:30 P.M. That was the first meeting of mine with my parents after joining in the Job. We boarded the train and I managed somehow to get the lower berths to my parents.






16-04-2016 Saturday



By 5:30 A.M. we reached Madurai and we finished our daily activities in Railway station itself and we went to had a darshan of Meenakshi Amman Temple. I was bit worried because my friends said that there will be heavy crowd because of the festival time but surprisingly very less number of people were there and peacefully we had our darshan. I booked a Surya travellers from Madurai to go Rameshwaram by showing all the sightseeing places and dropping there. He had given a great time to visit the temple in Madurai otherwise we could have missed out the temple because of the rumours spread by my friends. Tamil people are so kind enough that they will help you at each and every point. I have to say thanks to all my friends who had given me so much information.



We took a tiffen parcel and boarded the bus at 8 A.M. He started the journey by 8:30 A.M. He drove slowly through the main roads of madurai and finally he reached PAMBAN bridge by 12:00 P.M. there he stopped the van and we had a time for photo-shot. Air blowing was very much high at that time and luckily we saw a train crossing the train bridge. Pamban Road bridge and Rail bridge are differ in altitude by very much. Road bridge is very highet from sea level but whereas the Rail bridge is just 10-15 meters height above the sea level. After taking some snaps, we proceeded towards rameshwaram. Rameshwaram is an island and it is situated at the very southeast corner to Tamilnadu. Rameshwarm town itself is around 15 K.M. from Pamban bridge. Before proceeded to the main temple tour operator has showed us some tourist places like Seetha theertham, Lakshman theertham, APJ Abdul kalam Monument, Sachi Hanuman temple and floating stone etc. Then he has taken us to Agni theertham(sea infront of rameshwam temple) and we took a dip over there. Then we proceed to rameswaram temple. There we saw lot number of people were wearing white dhoti and white shirt. We asked one of them to take us to each and every well. He charged Rs. 100/- per head. It is better to take one person along with you because of to avoid the long queues. The temple had opened again at 3:00 P.M. He took us directly to each and every well and all the time he skipped a huge rush and moreover they will pour you one full bucket of water if you go through these people, other wise they will pour one bucket of water on 3-4 people. We have taken a bottle with us to collect the water. After taking bath we changed our wet clothes. There is a separate room for that. Then we went to darshan. Since it is the evening time there is no rush in the temple. We saw the lord Ramanathar (seetha prathista) and Vishwanathar (anjanaya prathistha lingam) , Spatika lingam, Vishalakshi amman and went to Parvatha vardini ammans. We came back from the temples and went to see the longest temple corridor in the world of rameshwaram. Since we don't have an ample time we came out of the temple and took a battery operated car till the main gate (South west )of the temple where autos and vehicles were stopped. After that they put some barricades so it is better to take battery operated cars which were run by temple committee. We took an auto from that auto stand and went to Railway station which is at a distance lesser than 2 K.M. We boarded the Boat Mail Express to go Trichy. Though, I know there will be lot number of buses in Tamilnadu but i preferred this train because this will leave Rameshwaram at 5 P.M. so that i can feel the train journey on pamban bridge. Train started at 5:00 P.M. it hauled in Pamban railway station for 1 minute and started again. I stood at one of the entry gate of the compartment and taken a video. The train crossed the bridge the train took at-least for 5 minutes to cross the bridge. Train went through several stations but food options are very limited if you are travelling in this route so before the train crosses the Manamadurai Junction please choose your food option.



We reached the trichy by 10:35 P.M. there we bought some food packets and went to retiring rooms in the stations. I booked dormitories in advance. We checked in the beds and by the time only one person was in the entire hall. I strongl y suggest these rooms are best option if you want to travel to trichy. The timings for the dormitories/rooms are for 6 A.M to 6 A.M. At night 12:00 I went outside and I searched for a taxi for the next day's plan. I engaged an ambassador car driver for the day trip and I told him to come by 5 A.M.



17-04-2016 Sunday



We started our journey by 5:15 A.M. yes we slept only for 4 hours on that day and at this point i want to thank my parents who supported me for the trip though they felt very tired. First we went to Rockfort temple and we went to the ganesh temple which is at downhill. After having a darshan we started towards srirangam ranganathar temple. We can find the tallest tower of temple when we are on the kaveri river bridge. Actually we went on tamil new year day. So there were some festivals are going in the temple for that reason it took 2 hrs for us to have a darshan. We came back by 8:15 A.M. and went to Jambukeshwar temple. This temple is in srirangam island only and 2 K.M. east to ranganathar temple. This is also one of the big temples in Tamilnadu. After having a darshan of JALA LINGAM( one of the Pancha Lingas) and parvathi mata we were started to move thiruvaiyaru thyagarajar temple at 9:45 A.M. He took bypass road of trichy and went in trichy - tanjore highway. He passed through the BHEL and some places. He reached thyagaraja temple by 11:00 A.M. We went to the temple where the adhyanotasavas took place and had a darshan over there. After that we reached the tanjavur (tanjore) big temple and went inside. Without slippers that was very hard for us to walk on the tiles of the temple and the sun is exactly on top of us, as I can say 90 degrees to us. The lingam is very big in size inside the huge temple. We have taken some snaps here and there around the temple and started by 1 P.M. to Tanjore palace. We visited the big bell temple, Saraswathi mahal, Tanjore paintings and started around by 1:30 P.M. and went to had a lunch in hotel near by railway station. After having lunch driver dropped us at railway station and he was so kind enough. His name is Appu, though he is an aged person he knows every place of trichy tanjavur. He showed all the important places and explained the importance about the places also well. We boarded the train at 2:50 P.M. RAMESHWARAM - BHUABANESHWAR Express which came on that day with 20 min delay. I get down at chennai egmore by 9:30 P.M. and my parents continued their journey in the same train and alighted at Vijayawada which reached next day morning by 6:00 A.M. then they boarded immediately Satavahana Express for which I already done reservation to go Khammam. They reached home by 8 A.M. and my father went to his office work by 10 A.M. Though we had a very short duration we enjoyed a lot.






Thanks for reading 😊...!!!

Temple from rooftop
Due to a bit of bad planning we ended up spending 2 more nights in Madurai. It's the second largest city in Tamil Nadu so not a bad place to get stuck waiting for a flight. We survived the trip back down the hill from Kodaikanal. It only took 3 hours down (4 hours up) and the bus wasn't full so not to bad an experience. Only about a kilometre of the trip had vertical drops so no sphincter strain at the end.

We decided to walk around the outside in the cool of the morning. We repaid a promise to the store owner who had helped us, by lending me a dhoti to enter the temple, in returning to his shop to have a browse. They have set up a viewing platform on the roof of the shop to overlook the temple and act as a draw card for prospective clients. It was a nice place to chill with a breeze. I risked the bamboo ladder to get to the very top.

Unfortunately, for him, we didn't see anything we liked that we could have carried but did see some tempting statues and carvings.

We then went
North gate
out to the Ghandi museum which has a great pictorial history of India and its road to independence. The show piece for the museum is the blood stained clothing he was wearing when he was shot. Not quite as impressive as Ho Chi Minhs embalmed body in Hanoi but does make these historical figures more relevant when you encounter their physical being or artefacts.

With an afternoon free we found a post office to send some post cards, a barber to get a shave and haircut and a few hours browsing in a branch of Chennai Silks.

Bus ride
Our travel plans for the next week have forced some commitments on us. We are booked to fly from Madurai to Colombo, Sri Lanka, 28th December. We had hoped to spend Xmas in Colombo but Airfares were prohibitive over the Xmas break period, We only had one spot on our must see agenda, the Meenaski temple in Madurai so had to come up with a plan for the remaining 4 days. We spotted a hill station , Kodaikanal, in the Western Ghats that was only 4 hours by bus from Madurai so started planning a trip. Looking on Booking.com I spotted a Xmas deal being offered at the best hotel in town. It would work out costing us the savings we had just made on the airfares but after all its Xmas so decided to splash out. So here we are at the Carlton Hotel. Full buffet breakfast and dinner, complimentary tour package for 4 hours, 30 minutes boating on the lake, 200 channels of satellite TV plus entertainment action all day long. Bingo at 6 pm!! Did I mention the Bar?

We had arranged to call home mid-day Xmas day NZ time to chat to family. That meant a
Lake View
5am wake up call. I hope no-one was too upset being created on video calling by two people in bed wearing Santa hats which were given to us at the Xmas Eve buffet and disco the night before.

This is certainly a part of India only the privileged few get to visit and stay and feels very out of place from what we have experienced so far. In some ways looking forward to getting back to the hustle and bustle of the plains. Certainly not looking forward to the bus down the hill.

Island with cricket players
They call it a temple pond. But it is no small pond. Vandiyur Mariamman Teppakkulum is about one km around its red and white striped perimeter walls that enclose an excavation of about 16 acres. A smooth slabbed surface circling it makes for a good walk. Everyone else had the same idea one cloudy morning as I wandered around the structure.

King Thirumalai Nayakkar excavated the soil in this area, it is said, to make the bricks for Thirumalai Nayakkar Palace. This was back in 1645 AD. Twelve staircases around the four sides descend into the tank. People can go down the stairs to the bottom to play cricket or to walk to the central mandapam that supports a temple and garden.

Now the floor of the tank is dry, but soon waters from the nearby Vaigai River will flow though some of the original underground channels to fill the tank in preparation for the annual float festival. The Goddess Meenakshi and her consort Lord Sundareshwarar, housed at Meenakshi Amman Temple, will be carried there on floats and paraded around the tank. The colorful festival attracts many.

I had to settle for watching the cricket players and a
Red white red white
cow grazing in its verdant growth, and meeting people enjoying or doing work in the area that morning.

First, three guys from Rajasthan begged me to take their photograph.“Why are you here?” I asked, knowing they were far from their home in the north.

They motioned to a cart of woven fabrics. “Business,” they replied.

I wished them luck, and then met a man who watched me take a photograph. We exchanged pleasantries, and then I met a shy boy on a bicycle who tried out his English and posed for his photo.

As I contemplated a stone relief carving of a fish with an elephant trunk on one of the staircases, I noticed two young cows in the busy street, standing as motorcycles buzzed around them. A man on a scooter stopped on the side, went to the cows and waved them out of the road to safety.

Then I found men dyeing masses of threads in rich red dye, repeatedly dipping and wringing out the bundles. Four of the men did a dance of sorts, weaving among each other, stretching out and sorting a bundle of long threads, keeping its length ordered and
Unraveling
tangle-free as one of the men wound a skein around his arms. They were all very focused on their work—one misstep could create a tangled mess, and destroy their progress.

My host told me later they were Saurashtra men, whose traditional work was weaving cotton and silk cloth. The Saurashtra people migrated from a region in Gujarat, perhaps starting eight centuries back, with many coming to Tamil Nadu and many settling specifically in Madurai. One source said they were employed by the Nayak Kings as official palace weavers in Madurai. Today they may constitute from one fifth to one fourth of Madurai’s total population. In their homes, most still speak their Indo-Aryan derived Saurashtra language—which has been influenced by all the regions that the migrants passed through over the centuries. The written script is rarely used. They also speak Tamil, a Dravidian language, of far different origins.

The ten or so men pounded stakes in the ground, and pulled on the wood scaffolds that stretched the fibers tightly. They strung the bundles of warp threads, probably silk, reaching 50 meters or so over horizontal supports to dry in the sun. They would later, I guessed, weave these into
The three guys from Rajasthan
saris. They were careful to keep the material off the dusty ground. I wondered how long they would be there, waiting for their dyed threads to dry, and did they come to that spot everyday, just beyond the walls of the teppukkulam. Others may have wondered the same, because they stopped also to watch the men go about their work.

Vandiyur Mariamman Teppukkulam seems to be a gathering place for everyone. There is the casual walker trying to shed a few excess pounds and who barely notices the street cows and the vendors from the north. And there are the men whose ancestry originated in the north, but who now call Madurai their home, where they carry on their traditional culture, language, and work.

Then there is the stray tourist such as myself, much like a cow, I suppose, who stumbles around the tank, snapping photos of walls and four legged cows and bundles of thread, and feeling very much a part of life around the teppakkulaum that particular morning.

Bridge in Ramaswaram
Cars stopping on the bridge to take photos.
If you read the proposed itinerary at the start of the blog you would note we had plans to go to the Indian side of Adam's bridge. That's the point where back in the 15th century India and Sri Lanka were physically joined. These days there is a chain of sandy islands and treacherous sea currents. Spiritually it's a big pilgrimage site. Rama, incarnation of Vishnu led a group of monkeys and bears across a monkey built bridge to Sri Lanka and defeated the demon Ravana to rescue his wife, Sita. They returned to Rameswaram to offer thanks to Shiva. None of the above is the reason we are here but it is an important place for Indian devotees and is a small tourist mecca. For us it's the spot of our first photo, Indian looking at Sri Lanka, next week we hope to take another photo 15 miles away from the Sri Lankan side looking back at this spot.

We had planned two nights here but the hotel we had booked couldn't process a Visa transaction and we had limited cash. A bit of a dilemma ensued so we headed off around the town to find a working ATM
Pop up Parade
and get a feel for the place. We spotted a small travel agency where after a discussion about how lucky we were to have two boy children, why we didn't get married until 30 and a complete run down on the 799 runs India scored against England in ChennaI we had organised a jeep to take us to the Southern most point of the sand dunes which could leave in 20 minutes. This meant we could leave town after only one day. To top off a successful day we discovered a working ATM.

The trip down the beach turned out to be a trip down the new, but as yet unopened tar seal road. Coincidently our jeep driver had special clearance to use the road, I am guessing he paid a bribe to someone. What we expected to be a four hour drive over sand dunes only took an hour. A perfect day out.

Portico
Our last two stops, Ramaswaram and Madurai, are both dominated by significant temples.

These temples are massive structures and very highly significant to the Hindu faithful. As tourists we have been welcomed to observe the devotees but there have been a few conditions of entry. The core of each temple contains an artifact that is sacred. In the case of the temple in Ramaswaram it's a small mound of sand that was created by Rama's wife Siva to enable him to worship Shiva. The temple in Madurai is built to honour Meenakshi, a triple breasted woman whose superfluous breast would melt away when she met her husband who it transpired was to be Shiva. Each evening an icon of Shiva is trotted around the temple to spend the night in Meenakshis's shrine. We managed to chase after these carts as they get hauled around at great pace but were barred from entering the final destination.

Out of respect all visitors should be covered so you will see me in a borrowed dhoti from a very obliging carpet salesman. Apparently three quarter length shouts aren't covered enough.

Fascinating places that we couldn't photograph in but the images will linger
Candles
for a long time.

December 23rd 2016

On the way to Avalanche
A trip with the promise of a views of a beautiful hill station, a 15 km run and a chance to sharpen my photography skills. Three of my favourite hobbies and how could you say no to that ?

I read about GoHeritage runs while browsing through the run events in India. I was intrigued and decided to check it out. I found out that GoHeritage runs were started by GoUNESCO, a group funded by UNESCO to increase the awareness of heritage sites. They had hosted a number of runs at Heritage sites in India previously and I thought I should give it a shot this time. It being in Ooty just made it all the more compelling as Ooty is one of the very popular hill stations of South India and I had not previously traveled there.



I booked my slot for the run along with the bus tickets to Ooty from Bangalore. I decided to take the Airavat Club class (Their motto - ""Sleep like a baby"" and they don't disappoint :P) bus from Karnataka State Transport which are very comfortable. For lodging, I chose Garden Manor for the first 2 days which was located
Avalanche Lake
very close to the Botanical Gardens near the heart of the city and Hotel Lake View for the last day. I reached Ooty 2 days early as I had to collect my bib for the run on Saturday and to have time to roam around the place. The hotel was pretty close to the bus stand and I took an auto to the hotel after the bus reached at around 7 in the morning. My check-in time was 10 am but the hotel staff were gracious enough and let me freshen up in a temporary room. I then booked a taxi for all the days so that I could travel around easily. The plan for the day was to visit the Avalanche lake. After having a decent breakfast, I was on my way to the lake. The traffic near the city reminded me of the crazy Bangalore traffic but it eased off as we moved out of the city. The lake was about 30 km from the city and on the way I was able to city the Emerald lake which looked supremely scenic with the surrounding greenery. By the time we reached the checkpost, it had started raining heavily.
View from Doddabetta
The Avalanche lake can only be viewed when you book a safari which is run by the forest department. They provide the bus, jeep or van depending on the number of people. Due to the heavy rain, it was very difficult just to go to the ticket counter. Thankfully it subsided in a while. I had initially opted for the bus which had a long wait time but then met a few folks who were waiting for 2-3 people to fill their jeep. As that would cost me the same and would start earlier, I decided to join them. The safari's first highlight was the Cauliflower Shola which gets its name as the canopy of trees on the hills when viewed from a view point resemble a cauliflower. Post that came the Thalai Bhavani which is considered to be the source of the river Bhavani. It also has a Bhavani Amman Temple. And finally to top the views came the Avalanche lake. Though the lake had less water as it was May and the rains were yet to fill it up, that did not make the sight less appealing. The Lake glimmered with red sand surrounding it on its sides
Orange
Sim's Park
and hills giving a green upper border to it. After admiring it for quite a while, we decided to head back. On the way back I got acquainted to a kid with his family who kept entertaining everyone throughout the return journey. From the checkpost it was back to the hotel. By the time I reached my hotel, it was around 6 pm. I ordered dinner at the hotel itself and then decided to rest as I was pretty tired.



The next morning, I got up at around 8 30 am and got ready quickly. The plan was to first visit Doddabetta and then collect the bib from Lawrence School. Doddabetta turned out to be a dampener after all the hype as it was overcrowded though it had some good scenic views. Even the tea there did not match the expectations. From there it was to Lawrence School at Lovedale which had the exact opposite effect as that of Doddabetta. I was so stunned by the school's location that If the school would have accepted me there, I would have surely joined it then and there. The campus is of 750 acres with some amazing scenic and

architectural displays. The surrounding is very peaceful without the din of the city. With the bib collection out of the way, the plan for the day was to cover Coonoor. The main places there are Sim's park, Dolphin's nose and Lamb's rock. I started with Sim's park which turned out to be a photographer's paradise. It has been maintained really well and has a variety of flowers and birds. I hit the jackpot thanks to a small drizzle which resulted in water droplets accumulating on the flower petals. The photos speak for themselves in this case 😊 Dolphin's Nose and Lamb's rock are both view points offering differing scenic views of Ooty. Lamb's rock had a view of green hills forming a V boundary to the city with cloud patterns at the top in the blue sky. At Dolphin's Nose view point, I was able to see Catherine falls which looked stunning with the hills surrounding it. To add to its splendour was a rainbow again thanks to the drizzle. On my way back, I tried out a Foursquare recommendation, The Culinarium for evening snacks. It was a pretty good bakery with some great desserts (aesthetically great and tasty). I

tried the strawberry chocolate cake which did not disappoint.



Race started at 6 30 the next morning. The route was easily one of the most beautiful routes I have been on. It started at the main ground of the Lawrence School and passed through their gardens and in front of an old medieval styled church. Then it led to a forest like path for about a km which opened to lush green pastures and provided a view that was breathtaking. Post the view was a climb through a dense region for about a km which was breath-taking. We then came out into a road within the campus which then led out of the campus. The next leg of 5 km took us up a hill for half that distance which was filled with some stunning panoramic landscapes. By the time we finished admiring the lush green hills with blue skies and white cotton like clouds sandwiched between them, we had almost completed the climb. The descent was pretty easy and the end of it led to the next 5 km leg which was a meandering road through the countryside. This route had a few plantations with Eucalyptus
View during the run
trees and some other plants. Finally we ended back at the main ground of Lawrence School. It was a pretty eventful run where I struggled to find a good way to run with my DSLR strapped to me. Still I do not regret carrying it for the non-timed run as the route definitely deserved a DSLR. The organization of the event was great and I have been a regular attendee of the Go Heritage runs post this.



After taking some rest, freshening up and checking out of the hotel, I started off to Needlerock View Point at Gudalur in The Nilgiris. It was about 40 Kms from my hotel and I reached there by about 12 pm. The place was comparatively empty as it is pretty far from the main city. It was a short walk to the top and the overall 360 degree view was amazing from the top. The green hills extending on all sides with the breeze blowing on my face was something worth savouring. From there I moved on to Pykara Waterfalls which was about 20 Kms from Needlerock View Point. This was a pretty crowded tourist spot with a number of shacks
View through the last 5km leg
and shops on the way to the waterfalls. As I had gone there before the monsoons, the waterfall was not something spectacular though it was pretty well maintained and scenic. The places to eat there were not very good and hence after having some orange juice, I proceeded towards the Pykara lake which was about 2 Kms away. This lake too similar to the Avalanche lake was surrounded by red sand and formed a very picturesque view. There was boating available (motorboat) which was well worth the wait (was pretty crowded too). At the lake too, there was nothing to fill my appetite and I had to settle for a milk shake. After all this, I still had time and thus on the way back decided to head to the super crowded botanical garden. I had my lunch on my way some hotel on the way suggested by the driver. The botanical garden ticket queue itself was very demoralizing. But somehow I braved it and got it. Inside, it was decorated beautifully though there wasn't much space to move around. After viewing all the decorations which included trains, birds etc (flowers were arranged in those forms) and capturing the photos
Pykara Falls
I returned to check into Lake View Hotel. Hotel Lake View was definitely a very well located and maintained restaurant. There were cottages here which was located next to a lake. For the evening, I headed to my room to watch the IPL cricket league final. RCB sadly lost in a very close encounter but it was still a great match. Next day after checkout, I visited Ooty lake which was a pretty big lake. There was boating available there also though here it was a pedal boat. With most of the must see places covered, I caught a bus back to Bangalore in the evening.



This was my first Heritage run and I totally fell in love with it. Its a great concept to promote tourism. As the run is untimed you can take as long as you want enjoying the amazing scenic routes throughout the run without worrying about the competition. It felt great carrying a camera on my run (though I am still researching on what would be the best way to carry it) and record the route on it. My recommendation, give it a shot if you are a casual or professional runner.
Botanical Garden
The peaceful environment with the small crowds compared to the hustle and bustle of the city or the throng of people in a city is certainly refreshing.



Ooty as a tourist spot is pretty famous and it is very difficult to get places with less number of tourists. The flower show in the Botanical garden didn't help in this regard either. Ooty is undoubtedly blessed with natural beauty with stunning views though the timing might probably be better after the monsoons probably during Aug-Sept-Oct. It is very accessible by road from nearby cities and Bangalore.



On the whole a great trip and an even more great run.

Goddess Kali
I spotted a dog lying on a bench at the side of the road while on my morning walk. Seeing a dog was not unusual, but a puppy was curled beneath the bench, and my heart tightened. Then the pup moved on three legs and held its rear leg aloft. It hobbled beneath a cart nearby. I approached, all the while talking to him, telling him he was sweet and asking how he hurt his leg. He whimpered a little, and I reached out to scratch his ear. I’m going to have to wash my hands, I should not be touching this stray, I thought. Can I take it to the family at my homestay? Would they feel the sadness around this baby with the hurt leg and uncertain future and adopt him? I walked on, and tried not to think about it.

At the intersection I paused, contemplating the busy-ness of Lady Doak College Road, then decided not to travel further and return instead to my homestay. But a man walked up from behind and he stopped next to me. His grizzled whiskers and plaid lungi folded around his waist suggested he might be a laborer. But he surprised
Bird Rangoli
me by speaking to me in English.

“Good morning. Can you tell me, what is that over there?” He pointed across the street.

I replied in Tamil. “Hello! That tree?”

His face smiled and he continued in Tamil. “No, that."" He pointed to a tall metal tower with attached discs that probably beamed radio signals of some sort.

“I don’t know,” I replied in Tamil.

He commented on my speaking Tamil, then he asked me my age. I continued in Tamil, and told him I was 63 years, and then I asked him his.

“Just today I am 72 years old.”

I had reached the limit of my Tamil words, and so we both continued in English. “So it’s your birthday today? Happy Birthday!” I then sang a couple lines of the song, and he clasped his hands together in gratitude.

Then he said his name was Murugan, “like the God.” I said my name was Terry.

“Names are not important.” His eyes fixed on mine and both his hands went to his chest. “It’s what is in your heart that is important.”

All I could say was “yes,” and

I felt my insides swelling and it spilled onto my face that froze into a smile, and my face stayed that way for much of the rest of my walk.

The trash collector’s cart—a small wheeled affair powered by a person on the attached bicycle—was parked on the side of the road. What drew me to it was the clump of bright orange flowers tied to the handlebars. Trash collection is not a glamorous job at all in India, but the collector was doing her best to put a spot of color in her day. She saw me before I could get a photo of her vehicle, and with clumps of gold stretching her ear lobes to her shoulders and rimming her ears, she was truly a vision as she approached, arms loaded with bags of trash. I timidly asked for a photograph, but my Tamil is so poor that I could not make myself understood, and I could not understand her in return. I did not take the photo, but the vision of the orange flower and those swinging cubes of gold remained.

In the mornings I’ve been visiting the neighborhood Kali temple, a small shrine where
The Kali temple
Vinayagar and Lord Murugan flank the entrance
goddess Kali, peering from a mask of jewels, sits inside. Today I noticed the split coconuts at her feet, with white meat glistening. The same woman sits at the temple daily, and when I approached today, her smile beckoned and we exchanged greetings. I removed my sandals and stepped before powerful Kali, and the woman lit some oil and circled the metal tray before Kali, then brought the flame to me. I waved the blessing to my head, then took some red powder to mark my forehead.

Then more women gathered around. The older sister of a neighbor reminded me that I had met her, and the others commented on my speaking Tamil. But then the old woman approached. She was very old—at least she looked very old. Her lips curled around her toothless gums, the thin skin on her dark arms was crinkled like crepe paper. She grabbed my hand and held on, and said something that I imagined was meant to welcome me. I asked her age. But the others there pointed to their ears, indicating she couldn’t hear a thing. She just kept holding on to my hand and mouthing words, and I kept smiling. I
Kali peers from her mask
had seen her there before, curled up in a cart under her sari, just sitting and sitting, and I wondered whose grandmother she was, and who took care of her, and would she die right there in that cart someday and would people even notice. And here she was, greeting me, and she was all bent over and was very very old.

I walked away from that temple with a bowl of pongal, the special sweet porridge, and it was warm in my hand, and women were calling goodbye, and I told the lady who lit the fire I would see her tomorrow. I wonder if I will also see the very old woman.

A rangoli, a stylized bird, greeted me at the end of the street, in front of the house where the woman daily draws images filled with color. Another woman with gold chains draped over her ears smiled her hello, reminded me where I had met her, and I told her I would visit that house later.

The bowl of pongal, still warm in my hand, begged for a spoon and for me to eat it. So I obliged after returning to the homestay.
Very very old woman in her cart
I savored its intense sweetness and explosions of cardamom.

Been visting many sites around the rural area of Kanadukathan. It's just a small village which at some stage in its past was occupied by some very wealthy teak traders. There a a large number of their palatial houses scattered around plus some really interesting temples. The selection of photos below is a snap shot of our two days cruising around.

The Flower Couple
Madurai is famous for its jasmine--those small puffs of creamy white, heavy with fragrance, heavy with sweetness. The women here buy the buds tied in long strands and drape them from their ebony braids, or adorn the greying hair buns of older women. Donning jasmine seems a birthright for women. Men must partake by catching whiffs as they trail the bejeweled women in the temples or on the streets, or hang strands from their rear view mirrors in their vehicles. My driver from last year adored doing this, to my great delight.

It is said that the jasmine grown around Madurai is especially known for its deep fragrance, thick petals, lengthiest petiole and delayed opening of buds, ensuring longer life. According to my host in Madurai, the soil here is the best for its production, and small farmers raise the plant and pluck the buds to be sold in Madurai.

They don’t make much money. Instead, the middle man—the dealer who buys from the farmer and then resells, gains the biggest profit. And there is indeed opportunity for big profit. Flowers are needed for the making of garlands for use in the temples, for hair ornaments, and massive amounts
Mounds
of flowers are used in weddings. Some of the jasmine is sold to places that extract the essential oil for export. Jasmine and other flowers are shipped by truck to other cities in Tamil Nadu, and are daily flown to Singapore and Malaysia, where sizable populations of Indian people need the flowers just as people need them in Madurai.

The flower market is where the deals are made, and so I went one early morning with my host to watch the transactions. At 5:45 am, the place was abuzz with people, vehicles, bags of color and leaves being carried on carts and heads and backs. Mounds of chrysanthemum-like yellow flowers, red roses, and white jasmine filled the stalls. Bags of green leaves—holy basil—important in the making of garlands, sat with crouched women, who were hoping to make a deal.

Within minutes of arriving, a man gave me two yellow flowers and wanted me to put them in my hair. A woman draped a simple garland around my neck, then held out her hand for some rupees. Others watched me watch the activity.

Flowers have always been associated with love. Well I found love—or perhaps, hopeful love,
Holy Basil to Sell
that morning—I got a marriage proposal—a man tried to fix me up with a buddy whom I tried to photograph. I declined the proposal. The jasmine wasn’t that intoxicating

But I did find an older couple, surrounded by the flowers they were selling. When they posed for my photo, I couldn’t help but notice that he placed his hand lovingly on her knee. I imagined they had weathered many a hard time together, as they tried to make a living as flower farmers, selling their flower jewels at the market in Madurai.

Cows
We picked up a car and a driver for the next 4 days to explore some the remanants of the Chola Dynasty. Established around 300AD it grew to rule vast tracks of Southern India and parts of countries around the Bay of Bengal ( Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand) plus established trade routes with China and Iran reaching its peak around 1300AD.

The remanants of its capital are now just a few temples in rural areas of Tamil Nadu.



As you see from these photos it must have been a huge place in its day. The scale of these temples is hard to show. The towers on the two largest are around 50 metres high.

The completed Rangoli
Suriya always includes a message in her Rangoli.

”We cannot touch the top of a tree—the branches get too thin and weak, and we would break them if we tried to climb them. So we must instead touch the sky.” That is the message of today’s Rangoli.

Today is the first day of Margali, a month-long observance when the nights are longer and the air is cooler. And for each day of the month, women rise early to prepare their canvas, on the ground outside their doorsteps, where they create mandala-like designs—called a kolam or Rangoli—of white outlines and color-filled spaces. Ground white rock or rice and colored powders are their paints, their hands are their brushes.

Normally Suriya would rise by 4:00 am and finish by 6:00 am. Only because I wanted to see did she set the time later, 6:30 am. By the time I reached her, she had started her design with a colored square, and I had no idea how large she would make it or how much time she would require. She has developed time-saving strategies to make the process quicker. She uses a small sifter to place color in large spaces, places
Time saving trick
a small round cup down and sprinkles white around its edges, leaving a perfectly round blank center. She uses other specially made sifting tools to create thin parallel lines and intricate designs. She moves quickly, does not hesitate in choosing colors or placing each line.

“Women are so busy in their daily lives. They take care of their husband, their in-laws, their children—they don’t have time for themselves. When they draw the Rangoli, they exercise their bodies, stretch their arms and hands, and they improve their mental health.”

Over the course of an hour, this determined young woman intently sifted the white rice powder through her fingers, focusing on each element of her design, growing it into her own self-expression. She sat down, then got up repeatedly to get more colored powder or a tool. She rarely spoke. Her hands absorbed her thoughts, melted with the surface, with her design, a moving meditation.

She never knows the final appearance of a design when she begins. Even with this one, we both started photographing the finished image, only to have her return to it to add details and change its final appearance.

“I don’t have enough space
P1000594
here. At my grandmother’s house there is much more, and I can make them very large.” She appeared to use every square inch in front of her doorstep.

“How do you feel about people stepping on it?” I asked.

She paused and looked at me, stone-faced. “I want to slap them,” she said. While she created this one, her neighbor needed to use his motorbike, requiring that he pass by her Rangoli. He avoided going over it with his front wheel, but the rear wheel smashed one side of it. Suriya’s face remained set as she picked up her containers of colored powder and sprinkled over the tracks left by the tire.

The design emerged, while life happened all around. Her ten-year-old neighbor, with smiles and intent, created her own faltering design across the courtyard. The son of another neighbor pumped and pumped water into plastic and metal containers, which his mother hoisted to her hip and carried inside their house. Another neighbor created a colored design, a flower-like image, then lit a wick dipped in oil and placed it at the top of her stairs. It burned for five minutes, then left a dark spot. Another
P1000558
neighbor quickly drew her Rangoli—she was expert at allowing two lines at once to flow from her fingers, and so her image included numerous parallel lines. The grandma, gray hair clipped short, stiffly bent over nearby, then sprinkled water and swept the area around her steps, and laid down simple white lines. A young boy with a mobility impairment called out for his sister from inside his house. Cinema music blared from speakers overhead.

“Puu-eee,” a woman cried from the street. I signaled to her, and she entered the courtyard with her basket of flowers on her hip. I bought a single strand of bound white fragrance for Suriya, for her hair, so she could smell as sweet as her creation was beautiful.

All the other neighbors around her had finished, but Suriya was still hard at work, until she stood up and looked at her art. She started taking photos, but then went back with her powder to add some details. Finished, again, and she looked happy.

Her work would be short-lived. In the late afternoon, she would sweep it up, sprinkle with water and remove all traces, then start a new design.

How very
Using a sifter to color large spaces
Zen-like, I thought. Nothing is permanent, that’s an illusion. Everything is ever-changing. This design would live a few short hours, and even then, people might step on it, the motorcycle would drive over it again, the wind would blow.

Try to grab on to something—a physical thing, a feeling, a thought, a relationship, a place—try to preserve it, keep it from changing. Can’t be done, and if you try, it may mean the quick death of that thing. So why do we seek to do that? It’s comforting to know what to expect, yes, to hold on to that beauty or good feeling.

Instead, seek to allow for transformation, for rebirth, for growth. Sense the essence of whatever gives pleasure now, feel it fully in the moment, and allow it to pass and continue its cycle of death and rebirth.

I took a photo of Suriya’s final Rangoli, hoping to be able to look on that image in the future and recall the feeling I had as I watched her create it. But the image is only a fragment of the experience, and I know that the moments of watching that design’s birth, with all the energies
Suriya starts a rangoli
that contributed to its appearance, can never be re-created. Not exactly.

And so it is. Let it be. Just let it be. For me, that’s the message of Suriya’s Rangoli.

Signage
Easy to find our way
All the monuments we had visited yesterday were free so today we decided to get the day pass and visit the two main temples in the village. The first was the Five Rathas (Chariots) which are 5 houses carved from a single rock. Taking it into perspective of being carved in 9th century they are pretty impressive. They were discovered covered in sand by the English 200 years ago which is why they are still in reasonable condition. We met a family from Hyderabad who offered some of their picnic lunch. They failed at identifying the usual answer to Where is New Zealand. Normally if you say same place as Bendon MacCullum comes from they know instantly.

The second visit was to the Shore Temple. It's on a small peninsula overlooking the beach on the Bay of Bengal. Impressive waves rolling in after the storm. On the way we were approached by a group wanting to take our photo. Don's devilous good looks do that some times😎. They were a group of teachers and student from a high school. Lots of fun and laughter as we exchanged photos.

That evening being Friday we hunted out a beer. All the
Recycling message with stone carvings
restaurants to date didn't serve alcohol so we wandered down to a place called Moonraker's in backpackistan and ordered two large bottles of the local brew called 'British Imperial Lager'. Served in a tin cup ice cold. At 6.5% it was decidedly sweet and refreshing. We managed to get home through the darkness without tripping up. Still no power in the town.

We are heading for Pondicherri tomorrow, two hours down the road. We need to start finding some working ATM's and make some miles before Xmas.

Rear end of a cow
The rear end of a cow. Black and white, projecting boldly from the house entryway into the street. Unmoving, patiently holding space, just there.

That morning I had seen only people and bicycles, dogs and water containers and motorbikes, until I had that vision. Timidly I walked closer, and through the protective metal grate across the entryway I spied the cow’s head, inches from the painted green door; she seemed to be peering right through it. Her head and horns were anointed with yellow paste and red dots—it had been blessed that morning by someone, but now here it was, most likely on its regular route, waiting.

The woman of the house opened the door with a basket of treats, and gently urged the animal out of the entryway into the street. She fed her only the best—carrots, biscuits, bananas, vegetables. She saw me taking photos, but she smiled for the cow, not my photo. Her affection for the animal was obvious. She held up a treat to the cow so it would turn its head so I could get a better photo.

The cow stayed, and the woman went for more treats. I watched with a neighbor
Love
from across the street. I asked whose cow it was, and he indicated that no one knew.

After bestowing her focused attention on the visitor, the cow backed away and the woman disappeared. The fed cow ambled a ways down the street, and stood in the dawning light near the seated woman with her portable market of fresh vegetables spread before her. I suspected the cow wanted another handout from the vegetable lady, but none was forthcoming. So she stood and became a very natural part of the street scene.

I walked on for a ways, chuckling at what I had just witnessed, then turned and retraced my steps.

Another cow, cinnamon brown with muddy splats on her side, same house, same scene—her rear end stuck out on to the brick-lined street. The woman again appeared at her door. She had more carrots for this one, and since it had not been painted and blessed, she applied yellow paste and dots of red to its face and horns, and tied yellow and red flowers to its horn. I fancied that the cow did not enjoy so much being painted, but it did stick around for more carrots.
I'm getting treats


As I watched them, their bond—an old friendship, a veneration of woman for sacred cow—their sweet bond drifted up and down the street for all to witness.

That evening, during the Karthigai Deepam festivities, I went by her house, and she invited me and my young interpreter inside to drink coffee and meet her son, an engineering student. She and I laughed about the cow visit. Her name was Buva.

My interpreter explained, “Those cows don’t go to just any house. They feel the vibrations of this house, and they know that it is good, so they are drawn here.” He really did use the word “vibrations.”

Buva said that she knew the owners of each cow, so they weren’t unknown to her. She said that if she fails to respond quickly enough at the door, the cow will push on the door, sometimes opening it. When I said that she seemed to have much affection for the cows, she didn’t even need my comment translated, and eagerly nodded with a radiant smile.

She was in love with the bovine of the streets, who gives milk, and butter, and ghee, and dung that can be

Mahabalipuram is a small town ( pop. 66,000) south of Chennai. It's a 'resort' town with lots of development along the beach. We have met people on holiday from all over India here. It's also part of what is described as a 'backpackistan' - one of the Indian back packer towns.

Geographically it's flat with a large ( approx 10 hectares) granite rock hill on the western side. It's here back in 9th century the locals mastered the art of stone construction on a large scale. Most of the individual temples are crafted out of a single rock or from a rock face.

We took a wander around the hill monuments on our first morning and then down to the bench in the late afternoon.

View from the hotel courtyard gate
Our hotel in Chennai had Buffet breakfast included in our room rate so we sampled the main breakfast options.

Masala Dosa, Idli with Sambar and Vada's. Add a little of what is termed chutney and it wasn't too bad.

A quick look outside the hotel and a chat to the front office guys convinced us we needed to get out of Chennai. Limited power, no Internet, no banks open and credit cards not being processed due to connection problems.

We organised some rupees through the Hotel and a taxi to our originally planned destination, Mahabalipuram. We couldn't make any booking so headed south heading for the Hotel we had cancelled while in Singapore.

We planned to stop at a couple of Art Cooperatives but only found one open. Both were tricky to find because the signs on the street had blown down.

Some very impressive modern art in the one we visited.

We arrived in Mahabalipuram after a couple of hours driving. Things were marginly better there, the Internet was intermittent and the Credit Card machines worked some times. At one stage we had to climb up 4 stories on to the roof of the

Creating the kolum with colored powder
Thousands of tiny lighted clay pots of oil shimmered on streets, alleys, balconies, and shop steps around Madurai. Karthigai Deepam celebrates the birthday of Murugan, the second son of Lord Shiva, and people here eagerly anticipated this holiday.

Outside the door steps of houses, women had created purple, pink, yellow and red flower-shaped kolums right on the street, and placed oil lamps and flowers. Women swished from house to neighbor’s house in their best saris, trailing jasmine sweetness.

Children ran up and down the streets, tossing fire crackers, waving sparklers, and setting off billowing light fountains. They were having a blast.

I covered my ears.

I waved at families through their open front doors, thanked them for photos. People rushed out to invite me into their homes. I drank tea at one, coffee at another, coffee at yet another, ate cookies and sweets and snacks, took more photos, wrote down family names. They all asked me to visit their homes again. Some invited me to lunch. At another, a group of women and I talked about husbands and children and work. There, I was instructed as to the proper way to talk with women: first ask about
Kolum and clay pot light
their husbands, then ask about their children, then about their parents. I asked everyone about the husbands and children, but did not get to the parents topic. And of course they asked me about my husband, and looked shocked or confused when I told them I had no husband. “I’m sorry,” said one, and I said with a smile, “But I’m happy, it’s just different in America.” Before leaving individual houses, they did a blessing for me, and put dots of red on my forehead, kungumum.

""Do you remember me?” a tall young boy asked me as I fled the noise on the streets. He flashed a mouthful of white teeth, dark eyes set in a fresh round face. Of course I remembered him, mostly because I was astonished at his impeccable English as he explained how his grandmother was using all natural coloring agents from a leaf to make henna-like designs on his younger sister’s hands. This had been on another street nearby, several days previous.

“Do you remember my name?” His name was Nandishwara, and this twelve year old walked me up and down the narrow brick-paved street, introducing me to his friends, classmates, relatives, and
Welcome
neighbors. A wandering minstrel used curved sticks to beat a drum hung from his neck, and I moved my shoulders and hips to the beat. Then he held out his hands for a donation.

""Give what you can--5 or 10 rupees, it's up to you,"" my young guide said.

Nandishwara took me to the neighborhood temple, down a narrow alley. That evening it was glorified with hundreds of oil lamps glowing at the base of the central deity/tree—an ancient looking being with ropey sides dotted with sandalwood paste and red powder.

“Just don’t photograph the tree.” That would be very disrespectful. Women were praying, walking around the small platform where the tree grew, and taking ash and red powder for their foreheads. Nandishwara instructed me to wish for something—but don’t tell ANYONE what my wish was—then three times ring one of the hundreds of bells hanging on a rack before me, then walk around the tree three times. I completed my ritual. Then Nandishwara told me it is a very powerful place, especially on this evening, and my wish will come true. As proof of the power of the place, he said that each bell hanging there
Lights and Kolum
was evidence that someone’s wish had come true, because the fortunate recipient returned to thank the deity with a bell.

Well, truth be told, I did not make a wish, so I can tell you what I did. I simply gave thanks for all the wonderful people who have been showing themselves in my life here in the Goripalayam neighborhood of Madurai. At that moment, as I stood before the flickering lights and hanging bells of all sizes, and the bright-eyed children and women in elegant saris, I needed nothing more.

Chennai Arrivals
Looking back to the arrivals area.
Our 'relief' flight as it was described by Singapore Air departed earlier than our scheduled one the day before. This meant arriving in Chennai at a reasonable time about 7.00pm rather than the original 10 pm.

After arrival there was a long wait for immigration but finally got through. Our pre-arranged Visas helped. Those folks picking up e-Visas applied for online had to join a queue to pick them up before immigration.

Finally in India after 27 years but Shelley and I didn't have a chance to celebrate, there were a whole series of logistics that needed dealt with. We were confronting a city that had been hit by a Typhoon, a country that had turned its cash situation upside down and we hadn't had a reply back from the Hotel we had booked.

There were no ATM's visible at the airport, they were probably in the part of the airport that was missing some of its roof!

There was no one staffing the pre-paid taxi counter where we had hoped to buy a taxi chit on a credit card and avoid the hassle of the taxi touts outside. There was a Cash Exchange open but they only had the new 2,000 rupee (about 40 Kiwi) notes available and changing that size note would be difficult ( or so we thought).

Deciding that big notes are better than no notes, used some of our US cash and bought a couple.

While standing in line had a very funny chat with a chap from England whose family emigrated from India many years ago. He was here for the cricket which starts on Friday and he was definitely supporting the country of his birth, not his parents. His humourous view on the cash situation and what the 8 people behind the currency exchange counter individual roles in the process was priceless.

Shelley had the bags so out we went to confront India!

Scanning the sea of faces and more importantly the sign boards hoping my last minute email to the hotel to meet us was in vain. As we slowly worked our way through the crowd, I spotted the tout with the profile I wanted. He was walking beside us, not saying anything, not trying to grab our bags and drag you to the car like the others, but keeping pace and trying to make eye contact and then a smile. As we cleared the first wave of touts who left us alone to head back to find other potential clients Mr Smooth stuck with us. By this stage he knew where we wanted to go, he had been listening to all the exchanges,so when he made his approach I engaged with him. The negotiation just came down to price..guess what 2000 rupees. That of course was the start of the game. I heard how the Typhoon had disrupted traffic, streets were closed, the flight delays had meant no work for two days, the time his wife has spent at the bank to get small notes after the big notes were taken out of circulation, etc,etc. all of these stories emerged while he dragged my opening offer of 500 rupees up to 1400. Deal lets go. He directs us to one of his drivers gives us a big smile and a handshake and wishes us luck that our hotel is still open !.

I had read in my Times of India app that the Typhoon had made landfall in Northern Chennai and in making my hasty booking all I knew was the hotel were close to the Cricket Stadium. In the taxi I quickly had a look at my map and realised our hotel was in the Central/Northern part and we were heading in that direction.

As we got closer we went through pockets of blacked out suburbs, trees down, power poles down and road closures in many places.

Our driver was in a jovial mood pointing out others misfortunes with a laugh. He came from a place called Rameswaram which is on the Eastern end of Adam's bridge in the south, a place we hope to visit.

It was a welcome relief to see the lights on at the Beverly as we pulled into the courtyard. They had no idea of our booking because the internet was down but they had rooms, power and running water. Unfortunately Shelley and I had to celebrate with a chilled water due to bar being closed for the day for a Muslim holiday.

A great day and a great result..night one in India in a pair of single beds with hard mattresses and the prospect of our first Indian breakfast in the morning.

Published: December 24th 2016


I am now back in India, having flown into Madurai in the south (the Western Ghats area) and hopefully then moving northwards up towards Gujarat and the Delhi area again. I'm not sure what's going to happen during this part of the trip to be honest. I left India because of their financial ""issues"" and had hoped that things would be manageable in a month's time when I came back, but that may have been a bit optimistic.

My original plan for India was to start in the north (Delhi) and leave from the south (Kochi) after about two and a half months. So I already have a Thai Air Asia flight from Kochi to Bangkok for the 11th of January. But then I had to skip to Sri Lanka which messed that up. I figured that when I came back the worst case scenario would be that the ATMs still wouldn't be working and I'd have to just stretch out the Indian rupees I'll have on me (obtained by changing foreign currency) until my 11th January flight, but that means I'll basically be restricted to the south and probably not able to do very much. Middling case would be that the ATMs work but only for limited-amount withdrawals - they were talking about daily limits of 2000 rupees (about NZ$40) - which could mean either the same as the worst case situation or perhaps it would be workable. (The problem with limited-amount withdrawals is that my bank charges NZ$6 per transaction from a foreign ATM so I usually try to get out about two or three weeks worth of cash at a time - if I have to make withdrawals every one or two days the fees will add up too fast). Best case scenario is that the ATMs can give out enough money at a time for me to continue as planned and see all the places I intended to, and then I'll probably fly out of the country from Delhi or somewhere. I couldn't book any flights in advance because I didn't know what would be happening. However my fingers and toes and eyes and heart were all crossed.

To ensure that I actually had money for the worst-case scenario, I got out a bunch of Sri Lankan rupees (LKR) from ATMs in Colombo and when I got to the airport I changed 71,000 LKR into US$466, so that when I got to India I could change that into Indian rupees (INR). The reason for that is because foreigners can't take INR into India - you can only get it in-country. There's a bit of confusion around this because India made a recent law-change which allows foreigners to carry 26,000 INR on their person and some internet sites interpreted this to mean import 26,000 INR which it does not. I had also been told that you couldn't change LKR outside of Sri Lanka (because, like India, legally you aren't allowed to bring it into Sri Lanka from outside so why would anyone outside the country be willing to accept it). So the best idea seemed to be LKR to US$ to INR, even though I'd be losing some money during each transaction. I think going from 71,000 LKR to US$466 to 27,200 INR I lost over NZ$100 along the way. And as it turned out the money changer at the Madurai airport does take LKR so I could have saved a step, but better safe than sorry.

Speaking of currency issues, a weird thing is that all the shops in the Colombo airport departure terminal have everything priced in US dollars. I didn't understand this - some Asian countries such as Cambodia and Burma have US dollars as their currency (alongside their own useless currency) but this is Sri Lanka. There were only three places to eat - two coffee shops and Burger King. The cheapest thing I could find was a burger and fries for US$10. Ten US dollars!!

I had 300 LKR left in my wallet, and I thought I'd just buy a juice or something on the plane. SpiceJet wouldn't take Sri Lankan rupees, only Indian rupees. Two points here. One, I don't normally buy things on planes because I'm cheap, but every other international flight I've been on accepts the currency from the country they are coming from and going to, given that the passengers may have one or the other but not necessarily both. And point two, it is illegal for foreigners to bring Indian rupees into India, so why are they expecting foreigners to be able to pay with Indian rupees on a flight going into India?

Still on the subject of oddities, I never did find out why there are posters of Fidel Castro all over Sri Lanka. Whenever I saw one I would think ""okay, I'm going to ask someone what that's about"" but then I would forget. I just googled it and (unknown to me because I'm travelling and aren't following world news) Castro died in November and Sri Lanka was a big supporter of his government. As I just saw on one Sri Lankan site, ""The world mourns the passing away of Fidel Castro. The world has lost one of the most illustrious leaders of our time."" The things you don't know.

It's only an hour-ish between Colombo and Madurai. We touched down at 3.40pm to 31 degrees Celsius. Immigration was quick and painless (unlike trying to leave Sri Lanka, where the person at the SpiceJet check-in desk gave me the third degree, apparently thinking it suspicious that I would be going back to India). The money exchange counter at Madurai does a weird thing as well, probably because it is such a small airport - when you change money they can only give you 5000 INR in cash, and the rest is put onto a Visa card which you can then use at ATMs to withdraw as needed with no extra charges. It wasn't until this was all sorted that I clicked onto the very obvious problem that if the ATMs still weren't working then I'd just uselessly locked all my safety money away where I couldn't get it! Fortunately the lady at the counter said that the country's ATMs were all working fine now, so no problem. Outside while waiting on the bus into town I asked a couple of other people and they also said the ATMs were working as normal. As I found out that evening though, they are currently restricted to a daily withdrawal-limit of 2000 INR. This isn't a problem right now, because I can use the Visa card from the airport for withdrawing money, rather than being charged fees on my own card, but it might become an issue later.

I had booked a not-very-cheap hotel in Madurai for the night, because the buses to Munnar only seem to run in the morning and it was the cheapest one on booking. com. The hotel's called the Kathir Palace and cost 900 INR for the night (about NZ$18). Outside the airport the taxi drivers wanted to take me there for 250 rupees, but I knew the bus to town would only cost 11 rupees and the hotel was then only a kilometre from the bus stand. 11 rupees is about NZ$0.20 and 250 rupees is about NZ$5, so although it makes me sound like an utter skinflint I wasn't paying that much of a difference for a ride. I had to wait for an hour for the bus, but I can be patient when it comes to saving money. I got let off the bus in the city and told to just walk straight down the road until I came to the Meenakshi Temple and the road my hotel is on was behind it. The directions weren't exactly precise, because there were a fair few turns along the way and I had to ask several times for directions, but I got there in the end. Airport to hotel, thirteen kilometres, 11 rupees.

Prostration
No matter how many times I visit Meenakshi Temple in Madurai, I’m still awed by the place. So much bustle, and jasmine in women’s hair, swishing saris, praying pilgrims, families and whole tribes of people gathered together, crimson tilaks on foreheads, echoing walls, deities peering from their rock skins, bedecked with flowers and sandalwood paste, and messages on tiny pieces of paper rolled up and dangling from their limbs.

Goddess Kali beckons many, her power draws like a magnet, and I’m entranced by her motion and the intensity of her devotees.

There’s nothing like Meenakshi Temple and its vibrancy, magnitude, devotion of its temple goers. I wandered into an area restricted to foreigners. I didn’t see the sign, but I knew. I slipped inside the massive open doors and sat down on a ledge above women sitting below cross legged. They’d brought bags of tiny clay pots, jars of ghee, flowers, colored powder, and they were creating designs on the temple floor. They rolled tiny paper cylinders and put them in the tiny pots of ghee, and lit them—patterns of light and curves and color. Some women read devotional booklets, looking dreamy but focused, others meditated on their creations,
Oh Kali!
using purposeful movements to create their offerings. A deity sat far across the hallway. I couldn’t see it from my vantage point behind the stone pillars. But all these women were in a roped off area, making their gifts to this deity.

I sat and watched awhile, slipping into their meditations, catching whiffs of sweet jasmine and the smoky burning ghee.

Exiting the chamber, I noticed the “no foreigners” sign, and was glad I did not see it before I entered.

Outside, in the long wide hallway bordered by pillars, people were sitting cross legged in a line on one side. I heard oboe-like squealing of a musical instrument and percussion clanging, and a group of musicians passed, making a joyous racket. An older man, baby on his hip, approached, asking me my country. We chatted for awhile, he used his broken English. Then he invited me to sit with his family—his wife and two older daughters, Lalitha and Kavitha, ages 13 and 14. Their mother Aishwarya, 35, shyly smiled, while the two daughters eagerly chatted in Tamil. Their father Rajasekar invited me to eat with them, for it was a special day where the temple would
Offerings
Colored powder, clay pot ghee candles, flowers
feed a certain number of people there for free. A man handed each sitting person a ticket, after which everyone made a mad dash to the eating hall. I ran after the two girls and we got in the women’s line and waited, while women in line exchanged their life histories with me. All smiles, everyone, they were amazed that the foreigner would eat with them. The two girls kept laughing; I called them my teachers because they wrote down Tamil words for me and seemed to intuit what I needed to learn to say in Tamil. We took a lot of selfies with my camera.

Once inside, we made another mad dash to the long metal tables. My red plastic chair was split in the seat—its legs splayed out and I almost collapsed to the floor. I exchanged it with Kavitha’s chair, since she was lighter. We sprinkled water on our banana leaf plates, and waited for the food guys, who showed up with shiny metal buckets, and started scooping and slopping rice and dhal and vegetables, appalum and unidentifiable mixtures. We dug in. Those girls were still laughing and saying how happy they were that I was
Kavitha, 14 years
there. I had told them I would eat just a little, but the rice kept coming and I kept eating and it was good.

Afterwards we parted, the family in a line, gazing at me and waving goodbye. The family of three daughters and a father 23 years older than their mother headed to the bus to ride back to their village Kumbu, 60 km and two hours away. My heart cracked, just a little, and I turned and walked away, ready to continue my journey in India.

We were thinking as India is world famous for cricket (even though Hockey is actually the National Game Fact!) I would check out any potential matches on our route and there looks like a chance we can get to the Fifth Test in Chennai according to this schedule

http://www.cricbuzz.com/cricket-series/2489/england-tour-of-india-2016-17/matches



I had a quick check on a booking site and tickets range from $10 for VIP seating area to $60 for a Corporate Box. That's a day out definitely on our list. Looking forward to a day out with Samosa's and a bucket of Kingfishers :-)

So the usual email from HR arrived which said ""You have heaps of leave days and if you don't take them we will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger""
A quick chat with the old girl and the decision was made.
""Lets go back to India, the south this time. I always wanted to go there"" she said. It sounds so easy.

Departure date is set for 12 December.

Logistics are underway.

House sitters organised. Sam is moving back in and Tim may be around for some of the time. Bhudda has been found a home.

Visas - double entry 90 day maximum which lasts for over a year only cost $95 each which isn't to bad. Had a fearful moment when they hadn't turned up by the date the Embassy had indicated. This date happened to be a couple of days before the Kaikoura earthquake so spent a lot of last week thinking they might be sitting in that train stuck on the blocked railway or other such images but they turned up a week later.

First few nights accommodation booked in Mahabalipuram with a night in Chennai when we land. 10.00pm arrival time is painful but found a place close to the airport for that first night. Getting apprehensive about the walk out of customs and into the swath of people that I am expecting to be there. Always the hardest bit of any trip. At least some of the sites, sounds and smells will hopefully be familiar from 27 years ago.

Having to think hard about currency. A couple of weeks back India announced that they were withdrawing all 500 and 1000 Rupee notes from circulation. All notes in circulation have to be deposited in to bank accounts except for 2000 rupees worth. Its a measure to try and drive India to an electronic currency country and make illegal cash based transacting difficult. It was announced and implemented straight away so there have been lots of problems with cash, ATM's running out of money, queues at banks etc. I am hoping that its quietened down a bit.by December. Thankful it didnt happen when we were there. It does mean at the moment the largest currency note is 100 Rupees which is $2. I will need to take the larger of my two money belts!

Vaccinations sorted. Shelley was reasonably up to date after her trip to Peru a couple of years back and our lifetime Hep a shots we got a few years back mean one less. Typhoid and Tetanus for me and no adverse reactions.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Yercaud
June 19th 2016
Published: June 19th 2016


IMG_1617
For a change, this time our trip timing was entirely dictated by Anagha’s summer break from badminton coaching. This being the final year in under-13 for her, there was very little scope for us to skip the training/coaching sessions. It was only towards end of April that 1 week break was announced and we immediately looked for availability of resorts in a drivable distance (less than 1000 KMsJ). This decision was easy we have learnt to respect our agreements. We narrowed down to Yercaud based on weather conditions, availability and closeness to Bangalore. Motto was to enjoy whatever Yercaud has to offer and relax rest of the time.

“There are times when you get what you like, and there are times when you have to like what you get”

The broad plan – start 11th May Wednesday evening to Bangalore, stay @ Grishma’s akku’s house in Bangalore. Start 12th morning to Yercaud for check-in, drive back on 14th again to Bangalore, stay overnight, and drive back to Hyderabad on 15th May Sunday.

Hyderabad to Yercaud – Previous night on 10th, I realised one of the head light was not working. So I had to take off from office
IMG_1568
for 2nd half, and it took quite an effort to fix the problem. We wanted to start @ 5 PM, and we started very much on time in spite of all difficulty. Drive to B’lore was routine, and we reached after 1 AM in the morning. We started @ 9 AM next day and it took us 2 hrs to get out of B’lore onto NH7. I had heard a lot about B’lore traffic, but to experience it was still different. There was all kind of confusion outside and lot of heat inside the car. Being in the driver’s seat and making decisions when all are advising, seemed the most difficult job in the world gurrrrrrrrrr......Luckily tempers settled down and peace was restored by the time we reached Yercaud @ about 2 PM. The drive uphill was scenic and exciting with 20 hair pin turns.

Yercaud - is a hill station in Salem District, in Tamil Nadu, India. It is located in the Shevaroys range of hills in the Eastern Ghats. It is situated at an altitude of 1515 metres (4970 ft) above sea level, and the highest point in Yercaud is at 5,326 feet (1,623 m). The hill station is
IMG_1572
Anagha and Grishma overtaking bike on Horse!
named owing to the abundance of forest near the lake, the name signifying Lake Forest. As a popular tourist destination, Yercaud is also called as Jewel of the South. Yercaud is connected to the city of Salem, Tamil Nadu through a Highway of 28 km. Coffee and citrus fruits, most notably oranges, are grown in abundance, as well as bananas, pears and jackfruit. Scenically, Yercaud is as enchanting and picturesque as the hill stations on the Eastern Ghats and trekking will be an experience.

The total extent of Yercaud Taluk is 382.67 km2, including reserve forest. The entire county is administered as a township.

I captured above information for the benefit of readers, and it had zero influence on what we are going to do there. We wanted to just plan things based on what we see and hear on the ground. We spent the evening @ Yercaud Lake with boating and horse riding.

The resort (Lake Forest) is not a Mahindra property, but is unique in many ways. The architecture is from the times of British and still maintained well. The food is of excellent quality and a lot to offer unlike the resorts belonging to Club Mahindra.
IMG_1559
For the first time, we willingly ate @ the resort after starting our stays with Mahindra in 2013. On the evening snack menu we had our favourite Aloo Bonda and Onion Pakodas backed with almost perfect weather (cloudy with light drizzle) for the menu.









On the second day we had a busy morning with several rides @ a small amusement park called “Poppy Hills”. This park can’t be compared with reputed parks with any stretch of imagination, but still had enough to keep us excited and busy. The morning was indeed spent well with few first time experiences in life. The rides included Bungy trampoline, mini frisbee, bouncing castle, etc. Spending time with little puppys was a surprise element (which made it Puppy Hills J).

Rest of the day was totally relaxing with after-noon nap and family time in the evening with indoor games. After dinner we spent some time in the open under the sky. If we were totally disturbed by mosquitoes on one hand, there was a baba on the phone advising someone on the other side. Every other moment we heard “baba, baba, baba, baba...”, and the
IMG_1583
”advice” was sandwiched between “baba, baba, baba, baba...”. This was quite amusing and we will remember forever.



We decided to leave early morning on 3rd day as we thought of visit to Bannerghatta. This was indeed a very good decision as we could cover some lost ground (disappointment of not seeing tiger) from Kanha. Wait of over 2 hours in the queue for Safari was worth as we could see bears, lions and tigers from quite close.

We ensured evening in Bangalore isn’t wasted by taking a metro ride from Vijay Nagar to Beyappanhalli. Good warm-up for taking ride on Hyderabad metro next year. On Sunday 15th, we left early morning and were back in Hyderabad by 2:15 PM, to complete the trip with good mix of activities and relaxation!

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Mamallapuram
March 5th 2016
Published: April 18th 2016


Having “three” days to chill before the boat to Andaman we decided to kill the time in nearby Mamallapuram, an hour and a half bus ride from Chennai. Mamallapuram is home to some of the oldest architecture in India, ranging from circa 1500 - 500 years ago.

The Pallava dynasty (circa 1000-1200 years ago) had an architectural impact throughout southern India, going north as far as Ellora (Near Mumbai, we'll be heading there on our way north), and due to their excellent maritime capabilities their influence even reached parts of South East Asia. Ankgor Wat in Cambodia (One of the wonders of the ancient world) was influenced by the Pallava dynasty. Although today it's a Buddhist monastery, I believe (I'll find out in a few months time), it was originally built as a Shiva temple.



The town itself is quite nice, it's been a tourist destination for quite a while, so it's well set up. There's WIFI readily available in most places, you can get all the western food you want, and it's not bad! We ate beef burgers almost every night we were there.

It seems like it's a popular destination for holiday makers and, as is becoming quite common in the south, the mature “Indiana Jones” traveller crowd. There's loads of resorts between Chennai and Mamallapuram, even a Raddison Blue! Spoiling the area somewhat.



The bus from Chennai left pretty regular and cost 29rs each. The moment we stepped off the bus a man approached us and offered a room near the beach within our budget, so get in his tuk-tuk and head to the guest house. When we pull up there's very promising signs, literally. The beach is less than 100m walk away and the sign says there's a pool! A fact backed up by the guy who took us there. We check in drop our stuff in the room and head to the “pool” to check it out.

Turns out the pool is in a “cleaning” process and we couldn't go near it, typical India. So a few days later when the guys running the guest house aren't around I took a look at the pool, if it had any water in it it would've been class! It was a massive pool and full of broken bricks from the construction site next to it! Unfortunately we had to be content with the Bay of Bengal.



Consulting the guide book to see what ruins to see first etc we see there's a big enclosure just to the back of the town full of old temples and monolithic caves, and best of all....it's FREE!

We decided to check this out first and leave the ones you had to pay entry for 'till the day after because one ticket gets you into both.



Just to the back of the bus stand was the start of the temples/caves etc. The first thing we came across was a monolithic cave, with an amazing wall carving on the outer wall (bas-relief), this is called Arjuna's penance. It appeared to be a depiction of a war or something...in an attempt to do it justice I'm going to quote the guide book: “On the left side, Arjuna, one of the Pandava brothers (who ruled the Pallava dynasty) and a consummate archer, is shown standing on one leg. He is looking at the midday sun through a prism formed by his hands, meditating on Shiva, who is represented by a nearby statue fashioned by Arjuna himself.”

The story depicted is one where Arjuna has gone to the ganges to do a penance, in the hope that Shiva will relinquish his favourite weapon to Arjuna (Shiva is one of the gods, if you're unaware). Arjuna has a fight with an old man over a boar they both claimed to have shot. After Arjuna cannot overcome the old man he realises it's Shiva, who eventually gives up his weapon to the noble warrior. I'll also upload a picture if that's^^ not helping.



There's quite a few caves/temples/bas-reliefs of varying degrees of quality, some of which haven't been finished properly. Some of the rocks just lying around have the distinct evidence that someone has started to carve something and then left it. We were told this was because whoever the dynasty of the time had been, they'd entered a war so had to stop building/carving and then when they came back from the war they didn't have enough money to finish them.

I absolutely love anything ancient, the freedom you get in India to walk around and explore ruins is amazing. Unfortunately the Indian tourist don't seem to have the same kind of respect for things, so the carvings of names etc into the walls spoils the experience slightly, but still not one to be missed out on.

Not only this but because of India's taboo on sex and young Indian couples, you often see used jonny's on the floor and couples sort of hidden away in the bushes. I think some of these Indian parents need to sort their priorities out, because some poor girl has definitely had her first sexual experience on a dusty rock.



The second day we headed out to the Pancha Pandava Rathas and the Shore temple. If you're going to Mamallapuram make sure you do these two in the same day as one ticket gets you into both for 250rs.

The Pancha Pandava Rathas are allegedly 1.5km out of town, so we got a tuk-tuk. Turns out this was some classic Indian overestimation of distance! It's like a five minute walk from the bus stand.

It wasn't quite what I was expecting, but still really cool. A stunning set of monolithic structures from circa 630-670 AD, a set of five free-standing sculptures that imitate temples and some well carved “life sized” animals, I hope I never see a bull that big!
These structures also appeared to be unfinished, even more so than the others. The rocks they were cut out of were still there, and the middle of the temples hadn't been carved out, so it was more like rocks with carvings and little patios, rather than an actual temple.

You can also find one of the earlist depictions in Tamil Nadu of a dancing Shiva, Nataraja.

The design of these temples has been replicated throughout the south even into modern times as the “template” design of a temple, in terms of the carvings and they style they've been done in.

The shore temple, with it's silhouette that can be seen along the beach for miles, dates from the early eighth century. It's considered to be the earliest stone built temple in south India. Unfortunately due to it's positioning wind, salt, and sand has eroded most of the finer details away, but still leaving a pretty impressive structure.



On the last day we decided to head to the nearby tiger cave, 5km away. I wouldn't recommend going here unless you're really into your ancient Indian architecture, the 200rs return tuk-tuk fee wasn't worth it, and apparently we got that price because the guy hadn't had much business.

It was still pretty cool though, a monolithic cave in a similar vein to the others, again not finished...or it looked that way. Massive lion heads surround the entrace to the cave, which did actually make it one of my favourites in Mamallampuram.

Given the lack of tourist here I seized my opportuity to climb on top of the cave and posed next to one of the great lion heads. I wanted to do this at the other places but sensed there would be judgement...or security would get involved.



We spent the afternoon on the beach being pestered by gypses (they're here too) who were walking up and down the beach selling trinkets and necklaces etc.

The current in the sea was too strong to comfortably chill in the sea, although it did make for a decent suft which some people were taking advantage of. I think I'll save that for Andaman, which is apparently a new found surf hub.



We got the bus back to Chennai that evening, ready for the boat the day after (6th). In hindsite we should've stayed put and got the bus to Chennai the morning of the boat, because in true Indian fashion I got a text the day later saying the boat's been delayed 'till the 8th! Nice one!



It's a good job we love Chennai so much....or not.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Kanyakumari
March 4th 2016
Published: March 4th 2016


Iconic Kanyakumari
Steaming frothy cup of tea to start the day. With the blessings from rising Sun God, we commenced our long drive to Cape Comorin, the present day Kanyakumari; the southernmost rocky tip of the peninsular India. The estimated distance from Varkala was 140 km and the travel time of 4 to 5 hours. Barely 12 km from the Black Beach, we reached the NH-47. The traffic was sparse and the chauffeur kept us engaged in his lively chatter.

The interaction with the chauffeurs I find, have been very informative, which adds to the knowledge on diverse subjects such as the local culture, customs, cuisines, lifestyle, history, do’s & don’ts, and above all the local politics. They have tremendous experience of ferrying tourists on a day-to-day basis, and their exposure makes them very resourceful. As an icing on the cake, the interaction keeps them in good humor throughout the trip. One cannot wish to have a better travel companion.

On the outskirts of Thiruvanthapuram, large housing and commercial complexes consisting of skyscrapers became visible for the first time in Kerala. The chauffeur informed us that this is the Techno Park and all major software companies like TCS, Infosys have their
The Room With A View ....
large establishments there. On seeing the large number of cars parked on the multi-storied car parks, the magnitude could be easily gauged. The road-widening work coupled with the peak-hour city traffic slowed our pace drastically. The office-goers were seen rushing to their glass-clad workplaces. We moved on … though at a snail’s pace.

We passed the diversions towards famous beaches - Kovalam, Vizhinjam, Poovar, and witnessed many shops selling fruits. During our road journey in the last 4 days, we noticed that many varieties of exotic fruits are grown in Kerala, particularly banana, pineapple, papaya, guava, mango, and jackfruit. We were told that there are more than 80 varieties of banana alone, yellow, purple and red, having different sizes and tastes. The most favorite among them was red banana, which has sweet taste similar to strawberries. From time to time, we kept on refilling our fruit basket for the periodic consumption during our long surface travel.

No sooner we crossed the cluster of backwater cruise jetties on Neyyar, the inter-state permit was required to be taken to seek entry in the state of Tamil Nadu. Surprisingly it was swiftly issued after receiving the personal details of all passengers
Sunset Point
and the requisite fees. Thereafter, one side of the road was the state of Kerala and on the other side the state of Tamil Nadu. The road doubled as the border for neighboring states. Though narrow, the quality of road has been good throughout and well maintained too.

The journey continued and we spotted a vendor selling Neera, palm nectar, or a sap extracted from the inflorescence of toddy palms. It was sweet, delicious, translucent in colour, and high in nutritional value. The nectar was served in a cone made from green palm leaf. We could get 2-litres of real good stuff for mere Rs.100/-. A glassful, highly diluted Neera costs Rs.10 – 15, back home. The pit stop was really heavenly and it could certainly give a skip to Kingfisher Premium this afternoon.

By now, with the vibrant signboards and colourful billboards in Tamil language, it was evident that we have formally entered the state of Tamil Nadu. There was not much of a difference otherwise on the streetscape. As the traffic slowed down, we reached one of the major town on this route .. Nagercoil. Since the breakfast was skipped in the morning, we halted for
Kovalam Beach, TN
an early lunch at Chitra Hi-Tech Pure Vegetarian Restaurant.

It was a large dining room like restaurant. We could not fathom as to what the “Hi-Tech” meant. In order to receive prompt services, we opted to sit in non-AC section. The thali meal consisted on Sambar, Rasam, Potato Gravy, Dry Vegetable (boiled raw banana) with liberal sprinkling of Coconut, Curd, Papad, Pickle and Rice. Everything unlimited. The delicious Payasam (in limited quantity), for the desert was excellent. The pricing was reasonable. … while exiting the question still lingered as to what is “Hi-Tech” about it.

The ambient temperature had crossed 30 degrees and it had become unbearably hot. The car air conditioner was not able to give us the desired cooling and comfort. Yet, the efforts to avoid dozing off, in the front seat of the car, were in vain. The intermittent short nap was over when we approached large lotus plantations. We were hoping to see blooming lotus flowers, floating on the lake. The plantations were in place sans blooming flowers. Probably it was a wrong season or the wrong time of the day …. Not sure.

We reached our today’s destination little after 2:00 pm.
Fishing Jetty
Hotel Tri Sea. The south-facing room on the higher floor ensured that we have an uninterrupted view the famous landmarks of Kanyakumari. The road below had constant movement of tourists from all over the country. Unlike other destinations visited in the current trip, most tourists were domestic and hardly any international tourist could be spotted. From the balcony of the room, we could see the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal meeting the Indian Ocean. The glare on the water was simply unbearable for the naked eyes. We decided to take a short nap till evening … it was much needed for the fatigue-ridden body.

In the evening we took a small walk towards the Beach Road and visited high-domed Mahatma Gandhi Memorial. This beautiful structure was constructed in commemoration of the immersion of the ashes of the father of the nation in 1948.

Later, at the edge of the ocean on the rocky mainland, we visited the beautiful Bhagavati Amman temple. This temple is dedicated to the Goddess Parvati as a virgin, who is also known as Kanya Kumari Amman, the presiding deity of the sea. Many legends are associated with Kanya Kumari. In the vicinity
Islands With A Glow
we also visited Adhi Shankar Temple. The tourists had gathered in large number at Triveni Sangham, as the time of sunset was nearing. This area had hundreds of shops selling touristy articles and wares. The flow of tourists was unabated. The last minute rush to take selfies before the actual dusk was visible at the site.

As we moved little away from this tourist market, a battery-operated bus was beckoning us to board for the sunset point, near Kovalam Beach …. not to be confused with Kovalam Beach in Kerala. The fare was either Rs.10 or 20 one-way …. not to sure. The environment-friendly mode of transportation facility by Kanyakumari Special Grade Town Panchayat, the local authority was highly appreciable. The short 2-km ride took us to sunset point. Midway, there was a view tower, and was full of tourists seeking panoramic view of the sea and surrounding landscape. The promenade at sunset point was full of large groups of tourists, from almost every state of the country. All had their sights sharply focused on the setting sun. Many were struggling to fit into the cellphone camera frame along with the sun, singly, jointly or with the entire family.
3-D Painting @ Mayapuri
The clouds were overcast and the visibility was little poor. As the glow on the sky diminished, we returned to the beach in the same battery-operated vehicle.

A short walk towards Kanyakumari Railway Station, brought us to Mayapuri – The Wax Museum. The entrance fee was Rs.100/- per head. It was a small place, which housed well-made realistic statues of famous personalities. Amitabh Bachchan, Mahatma Gandhi, Barack Obama, APJ Abdul Kalam, Manmohan Singh, Rabindranath Tagore, Albert Einstein, Mother Theresa, Michael Jackson … to name a few …. all of them housed under the same roof without any individual ‘security cover’. In an adjoining hall, there were aesthetically lit 3-D paintings. The uniformed staff was quite friendly and helped the tourists to click photographs with the statues or 3-D pictures in the background. Young and old, both were delighted with the visit to this place and have their pictures clicked.

The evening was well spent and it was time to return to the hotel room. The tourist flow to the beach was getting diminished with every passing hour. The brightly lit islands, housing Thiruvalluvar Statue and Vivekananda Memorial, were now deserted. The roar of the ocean could be clearly
Rising Sun
heard from the balcony. We did not venture out for dinner and the same was ordered from the hotel kitchen. A small ‘spirited’ relaxation was followed by the dinner consisted of Prawns, Dal-Fry, Chapatis and Rice, with Pickle and Papad. The spicy aromatic prawns curry satiated the hunger to a very great extent. A brief walk, before hitting the bed, on the periphery of the roof-top pool, under the moonlit sky, was heavenly.

During a holiday, getting a cup of tea, as soon as you are awake, is very difficult. We, urbanites, have formed certain peculiar habits … rise early, go for a walk and have a tea at a street-side tea joint, before embarking on the day’s routine. Most hotel kitchens open only after 8:00 and Tri Sea was not an exception. There was hardly any movement on the road below. I was taking a small walk in the hotel balcony when I noticed a mini-bus, after having undertaken night journey, stopping near the reception. A tea vendor followed the bus on his cycle and was serving tea from his kettle. I rushed to the ground floor with lightening speed. The tea was the god-sent brew. As usual,
Ferry Jetty
had two cups, each costing Rs. 10/-. The service was invaluable at this odd hour. I was his one of the initial consumers and was impressed with his concern for cleanliness. He had a small bag tied to the cycle for collecting used cups and disposal later at an appropriate place.

A quick hot water shower was followed by the ascent to the terrace. The sunrise time was nearing. The sky was receiving the initial glow heralding the arrival of the Sun God. Upon panning the vicinity in 360 degrees, I realized that I am not the only one awaiting the arrival. The guests in most hotel terraces had risen early and assembled with their cameras, in stand-by mode, to capture the orange sky-scape. ‘Selfie” has become an extremely vital element of every tourist destination. At 6:20 sharp, we could hear blowing of the “Shankh” (conch shell). The sound was emanating from the temple on the beach. There was a sudden rush to capture the first glimpse on sun on the camera. The sun had surfaced on the horizon … and within minutes the crowds on the terraces dispersed, with an ecstatic satisfaction of viewing the sunrise of lifetime
Thiruvalluvar Statue
at Tri-Sea.

Later, we reached, on foot, the jetty for boarding a ferry to Vivekanand Rock Memorial Island. The ferry service is operational between 08:00 hours and 16:00 hours. Poompuhar Shipping Corporation is responsible for the operation. There was a long queue of tourists at the booking window. The estimated time required to board the jetty was more than an hour. Due to paucity of time, we opted for the Special Entry Ticket, costing Rs.267/- as against the normal ticket, which costs around Rs.50/-. Though the entry to the terminal was easy, the scene at the place of boarding the ferry was chaotic. Each passenger was provided with a dirty life jacket, before boarding the boat. The distance of 500 meters from the shore was covered in less than 10 minutes. At the time of alighting, the life-jacket was required to be returned, which was haphazardly dumped by the ground staff, making it still dirtier.

At the island, we were required to deposit our shoes for safekeeping and purchase an entry ticket to the monument, costing Rs.35/- or so. Swamiji meditated and received enlightenment on this island in December 1892. The Vivekananda Mandapam, has been constructed at the
Seascape
same location. The meditation hall has a statue of Swamiji, in meditation posture, carved out of black stone. The silence added to the divinity at the hall.

It is believed that, Goddess Pravati in the form of Kanyakumari, did her penance on this island. The rock, which is known as Shripada Parai, has been blessed by her foot – Shripada. A projection in the form of human foot is revered as the symbol of Shripadam. The Shripada Mandapam has Garbha Gruham – Sanctum Sanctorum.

Both the structures were designed with the vision that Swamiji, in the statue, can directly see the Shripadam. After having spent about an hour on the island, we returned to the shore.

Though, we wanted to visit the adjoining island housing iconic Thiruvalluvar Statue in standing posture, due to tidal restrictions, the ferry service to this island was not operational.

Thiruvalluvar was the highly respected and celebrated poet from Tamil Nadu. He composed Thirukural, which is one of the most important literary work in Tamil language. This literary work was arranged in 133 Adhikarams, each with 10 couplets. The 133 Adhikarams were divided into three major groups known as ""Aram"", ""Porul"" and
Vivekanand Memorial
""Inbam"". Aram represents Virtue, Porul defines the principles of Life for common people as well as the State.The last section deals with aspects of Love.

It was in his memory this 133 ft tall grand structure was erected. The 95 ft. tall statue of this poet stand atop 38 ft. pedestal known as Atharapeedam. The pedestal is surrounded by Alankara Mandapam, which has 10 elephant statues signifying 10 directions. The 38 ft height of pedestal represents 38 chapters in the Book of Aram in Thirukural and the statue of 95 ft represents the total chapters in Porul (70) and Inbam (25). Thus the statue symbolically signifies that the theme of Porul and Inbam are based on Aram.

Kanyakumari has multi-religious population dwelling in a perfect harmony. It has a number of tourist landmarks such as the Government Museum with a good collection of sculptured artifacts and crafts of South India; 1000-year old Guganathaswamy Temple, built by the Chola King Raja; a temple dedicated to Shri Sthanumalayan (Sthanu-Shiva, Mal-Vishnu and Ayan-Brahma, in one form) at Suchindrum on the bank of the river Pazhayar; Udaygiri Fort; Padmanabhapuram Palace; beaches, waterfalls, palaces and churches. However, the time constraint or improper itinerary
Shripada Parai ... Mandapam
planning on our part forced us to skip them and to move on. Nonetheless, we ensured that we pay a brief visit to Kanyakumari Railway Station, the ‘seemant’ railway station, on the southernmost tip of peninsular India, connecting with it the rest of India.



It was the time to hit the coastal highway … driving towards our next destination …. Kovalam and to continue with our Kerala sojourn. We move on ……

Our greeting at Chennai airport
Geo: 9.91399, 78.1217

So Thursday afternoon we arrived back in Chennai with 2 nights in the splendid Raintree St Mary's Hotel to visit the sights of the city and prepare ourselves for the dash through Mahaballipurum, Pondicherry, Chidambaram, Gangaikondacholapuram, Kumbakonam, Tanjore (Thanjavur), Tiruchirapalli (Trichy) and Madurai - some of these names take some complicated getting your tongue around.

Chennai (Madras, as was) seemed simple enough - a visit to Fort St George, a trip to the headquarters of the Theosophical Society. But we discovered the old Museum in Fort St George is closed on FRidays. Thinking it was still worth a look round we took a tuk-tuk there. Most of the Fort is used for government offices and security is tight and at first they didn't want to let us in because the museum was closed, but then we discovered that the Church is open all the time and as soon as we said we wanted to visit the church, we were in! Actually not much of interest other than the church so we then engaged another tuk-tuk for what turned out to be the rest of the day, another church - actually a kirk - then the HQ of the Theosophical
a visit to a temple being refurbished
Society though that was closed at first so a little bit of shopping to pass the time then a visit to the Theosophical Soc library and a wander round the grunds with huge Banyan trees and little temples for all religions. Very quiet and peaceful. All to do with some odd American and a Russian lady and Annie Besant.

Word from Liz

Arriving in Chennai was just mad. The traffic is crazy. We were well insulated in the big Honda car from the airport, but got a good taste of the fumes and crazy drivers the next day in a tuc tuc, including our driver taking us the wrong way,against the traffic, up a one way street. We spent our day in Chennai visiting churches, the Fort, a Hindu Temple and the Theosophical Society. Our tuc tuc driver spoke a bit of English and made it easy for us to get around, but all I remember is his weaving in and out of cars, busses, tuc tucs, bikes,pedestrians and the occasional sacred cow, amazingly missing them all !

Peter

Next morning our driver picked us up for the 5 day canter through all those other places with strange names. And
even the figures used in festival parades
what are these places principally famous for - temples, Hindu temples of course. First Mahaballipuram - for the shore temple and the carved rocks showing the descent of the Ganges and other things. Peter was confused by the Shore Temple remembering that it had been (40 years ago) right on the shore with its toes in the water as it were - now there are rocks and trees between it and the water, turns out Mrs Gandhi said something should be done to protect it from the waves. Make up your own mind - I have the 40 year old picture here as well as the current one.

Pondicherry not actually for temples, really nothing there to visit except the town itself to figure out how much French influence remains - lots of French visitors and little else is the answer! And actually the were in the middle of a Kashmir festival so we got to watch folk and religious performancs by dancers more used to the cold of Kashmir dancing in fur costumes in 30plus degree heat and humidity!

So it was the second day before we really got stuck into temples - two kinds - those built by the Chola
one of the artists in action
kings, pyramidal and unpainted, and temples from a later period marked by their 'gopuras' - towers crowded with painted figures showing many aspects of Hindu deities.

The Chola temples are fairly easy to understand, set in grassy courtyards the central building has an entrance way which leads to a long passage with the lingam form of Shiva in the inner sanctum with Brahman priests in attendance. At one we were fortunate to witness a special ceremony paid for by a devotee ,visiting from London, where the lingam, probably 4 metres tall, had water poured over it, then milk, then turmeric coloured water, then yoghurt, then water again, then rose water, then decorated with flowers.

The later temples are vast and vastly confusing, covering many acres and consisting of hundreds of rooms and corridors and containing thousands of sculptures. Some of this is off-limits to non-Hindus. You really need a map. At some they refuse to let you take a camera inside, then you get in and find they are charging 50 rupees (50p) to allow you to use the camera on your phone. I say 'when you get in, at Maduria it was a close-run thing for Liz who had to cover
a finished figure
her arms and rent a wrap to hide her legs, then bake. Inside there are shops, many selling what seem to be decidedly non religious items, others selling food you can offer to the priests. People wanting to be our guides, people praying even!

All this simply served to make us realise we know next to nothing about Hinduism, yet we have had temple priests happily putting red spots on our foreheads (for a donation of course) and even allowing us to take photos of their deities which is supposed to completely forbidden.

The other striking thing is that whatever time we turned up these temples were jammed with people - happily spending the day in family groups just sitting round in the grounds, groups of Brahmin priests (see photo) making sacred fires, accepting offerings, chatting on their moble phones, hundreds of schoolchildren in organised groups. Many people go beyond being happy for you to take their photo - they come up and ask (in sign language). A helpful guy who had already told us how to get to a viewpoint on the roof of part of a temple - where we almost fried our feet (no shoes of course) explained
this parade was causing a huge traffic jam
that these are poor village people who have never seen a photo of themselves. In the villages it costs 50 rupees (50p) to have a photo so they pose happily just for the chance to have a brief look at the image on the camera screen.

Liz again

Our next driver picked us up at 8.00 from our swish hotel in Chennai and proceeded to take us on a mystery tour of Southern India, where plans were often unclear to us, but where he was perfectly in control. He drove with considerable confidence and often laughed at the antics of others, but overtook on the inside and on blind bends and hooted lots, pushing others off the road, as necessary. He showed us lots of things on the way and travelling was made a breeze with our own driver and the air con car insulated us from the heat.
We stayed in some lovely hotels, like River view hotel, right off beaten track, down country lane. I had a wonderful swim all on my own in deliciously warm ,huge pool as sun set turned to red behind palm trees, dusk fell and night invaded, lit by a bright slither of a moon.Followed
turned out to be a funeral, the body in here
by dinner on a cool, open terrace.
Our driver stopped for us to get a glimpse of ceremonies and rituals on the way, such as the funeral of young soldier from local village who had died in avalanche on Parkistan border. Army officers and local police all looked very smart and crowds of villages crowded round as his body was cremated on a shrine. We also watched as 6 yr old twin girls, quite willingly, had their hair shaved completely off. Their hair was to be donated to the temple, who would sell it to make wigs.
At a river ceremony, where Brahmins were making offerings for families commemorating the death of their fathers, Mr. Morali, who had organised this part of our trip with Peter surprisingly appeared to meet us. He told us we were the first British visitors he's had, so we're being well spoilt. It was interesting to hear about his company and how the fleets of cars and drivers is organised.

This morning Ginnie was unable to join me for the walk because of her broken toe. My guide was Kingsley and he is keen totake visitors to a place where tourists do not usually go. The mode of transport was a good start. I rode on the back of Kingsley's scooter to the bus station in Conoor and then we took the service bus to a small village. The walk climbed up to a fort which was used by Tipu Sultan 400 years ago. Very little now remains of the fort except a few low walls now overgrown. The first part of the walk was a climb through the tea gardens. Trees are grown in the tea garden to absorb the dew. In the tea gardens I saw different tasks including picking, pruning, pruning the trees, spraying and collecting dead wood as firewood. Some of the tea is now picked by machines and this makes straight lines. The tea picked by hand has circular irregular patterns. In the tea we encountered wild bison. These can be quite dangerous if they are startled. On the way back we took a slightly different route to avoid one particular bison who might have become aggressive. There was a short section up through native wood to reach the fort. On the return walk we met several tea workers whoI were stopping for their lunch break. We very nearly missed the bus and had to run!

In the afternoon our driver to us on an excursion to a wildlife reserve. The drive was first up to Ooty and then down by 36 hairpin bends. Each hairpin bend is numbered. My photos didn't work out great, but we did see deer, wild pigs, peacocks and a large group of elephants. This group of elephants included a male, several females and one baby. In the dusk as we were returning we saw a solitary male elephanby just by the side of the road. The journey back was a reverse including those hairpin bends.

Thai coast from our balcony
Geo: 13.0615, 80.2478

We had one day at sea between Singapore and our next port of call, Phuket. Our normal routine was followed. We went to the quizzes and though we got close we were still one or two off the pace. We sailed through the Straits of Malacca where there were rows of ships all traversing the waters. It was great watching the traffic from our balcony and we were amazed at the number of ships going in the same direction as ourselves. This ship has been sailing at a much faster pace than the Astor. It is also amazing to observe the varying colours of the sea.

We arrived at Phuket Port about 6-30am on Saturday, 16th January. We watched from our balcony as the ship backed into the quay. There were several resort hotels scattered around the bay with rich greenery and white beaches. After breakfast we left the ship about 9-20am. At the port there were many market stalls set up for our perusal. We changed some money, looked through the stalls and then engaged a taxi driver to take us into Phuket town. We organised that he would pick us up about 4pm to take us back
In the market
to the ship. Then it was about a 30 minute drive into the main city.

The weather was overcast but very humid. Our driver had an ""arrangement"" with a jewellery shop in the town and he dropped us off there and we went in to look around. We were effusively greeted by the manager who kept trying to sell me a pair of sapphire earrings. Everything was “half-price” but they had some nice bags and other souvenirs there so we did end up buying some things as gifts etc. From there we walked along the street towards the markets. Though some of the town's buildings could do with some paint the streets were very clean and there were some buildings which were very attractive. We found a café, The Circle, and even though it was only 10-30am we settled in with a beer and used their free WiFi. It was very overcast and the day was humid but there was a fan so we spent an hour or so quite pleasantly.

We then walked down to the Market. This was a typical Asian market with open shop fronts selling all manner of goods. Food, clothes, shoes were all on sale and there
In Phuket Town
were a couple of motor bike repair shops and others with household goods. We then walked up a side street and along a parallel street. Here there were some smarter looking hotels with restaurants and other small boutiques. We went into an Antique shop. In the window Fletcher's eye had been caught by 8 Chinese figures, in porcelain. We asked the owner about them and were told they were the 8 lucky men. They were a set and we could have them for $A720. If we could have bought one or two we would have but we don't have room for all eight.

In the same street we happened across a Buddhist temple. This was called Sam Thang Shrine and had been founded by Hokkien Chinese in 1891. It had been recently renovated and was resplendent in its red and gold colouring. We walked down the alley way and explored inside. Typical of these places there were many statues of gods and small buddhas with a main altar behind the front table ladened with fruit and food offerings. We had to take our shoes off to go in and a small boy came in with us, to check up on us
Sam Tang Shrine
I think. The main doors were carved into spectacular statues of angry looking gods.

We then went back to one of the nice restaurants we had seen, The Baba. This was part of the On On Hotel. We dined here in air conditioned comfort. We had several small dishes of Thai food including spring rolls, four types of fried seafood, Thai sausage in pastry, a red duck curry and stir-fried beef. All were excellent. We washed it all down with Chang beer. Having used their free WiFi too we walked back the way we had come.

Past the jewellery stop at the next intersection there was a main roundabout which looked like the centre of the town. Across the road there was another shrine which we also explored. This was more rundown than the first one but it was larger. A lady attendant smiled at us and made sure we took off our shoes before entering. Again the many statues had their offerings and looked down on us, some benignly, others with a more fierce countenance. We noticed a minaret down the street so investigated to find a well- kept mosque. Then it was time for a refresher. We stopped at
Inside the shrine
a corner café and I had a lemonade while Fletcher settled for a Mango milkshake. We then walked back to our rendezvous point and found our driver waiting for us.

Though we wouldn't rush back to the town, the attraction here is more the beaches and resort hotels. Anyway, we had seen another corner of Thailand and had some interesting experiences.

We chose a walk around the lake here. We had a guide to help us across the river and for the initial route finding. After that it was easy around the lake. There was a range of agriculture including rice paddies, coconut plantations and mango trees. We saw the irrigation system being used for the coconuts. There were birds, heron, parrots, cormorants and a number of unidentified. Our guide for the first part of the walk showed us the marks made by snakes. Apparently all the snakes are poisonous except the water snakes. We met a young couple who have family in the area, but now work in Singapore. At the temple we met many more people. A young boy had just had his hair cut off as an offering and his head was covered in sandalwood. All the children were keen to practise their English and for us to join the blessing ceremony at the temple. Lots of photos were taken of course. The adults also wanted photos. We averted our eyes just a little to the slaughter of chickens at the temple. All through the walk the next door dog was our companion. She was very good and waited patiently when we were talking and taking photos. We didn't take a wrong turn, but she would have stopped us if we had.

We are staying at Cardamon house which has attractive gardens and a swimming pool. It is green and quiet here, and it makes you feel a little sleepy. There are sunbirds in the garden, they have a yellow breast and long slightly curved beak.

This morning was a surprise late addition to our journey. The Madurai tourist board invites foreign and domestic tourists to a local village for a Pongal celebration. The village this year was Thenkarai. This is special for the village and they all were enjoying the event and wanting to meet all their guests. We were given flower garlands. Inside the temple there was a welcome from the village and dancing. The main dance was with a metal cooking vessel balanced on the head. There were also two horse dancers on stilts. There was an opportunity to taste Pongal and to watch it being cooked. It is like rice pudding, with less milk. The village temple is an old Chola temple with inscriptions using a very old Tamil script on the walls. There was more dancing and village games.These included a strength competigon huge stones and dropping them over your shoulder. More than I could lift at the gym! The last game involved the participants blindfolded and given a stick to strike an earthenware pot. I had a go and was fairly close, but I failed. A tall young Californian won. The village also provided a very enjoyable lunch. I particularly enjoyed the chance to try the sugar cane. This is the special Pongal sugar cane which is black. It had a very fresh taste, sweet, but quite different from refined sugar.

After lunch we continued the short journey to Cardamon House. From here we can see the mountains, but we haven't yet started to climb.

Today was a very early start at 5.45am. This was for a walking tour in the old town in Madurai before the traffic and crowds arrive. We joined six other Indian Panorama travellers. The first part of the walk focused on the houses and particuladrawing the coloured drawings outside the door of each house. These drawings are made twice a day in the early morning and again in the evening. They are made of white and coloured powders that are sprinkled to create patterns. Today the drawings were particularly elaborate because of the Pongal harvest festival. They included representations of the rice cooking pot and the sugar cane palms that are used to decorate homes. We saw a lady cooking various breakfast food for sale and then tasted her cooking- a little like the inside part of a do-nut but less sweet and with a slightly crisp coating. We walked through various markets selling fruit, coconuts, onions, vegetables and a huge collection of bananas. The bananas are smaller and there is also a red variety which apparently has special properties. The final part of the tour was a climb up for a view of the temple. On this tour the town had a festival holiday feel with lots of people sayin Happy Pongal.

After a late breakfast at the hotel we returned to the temple. The temple has ancient foundations and was the centre of the old city of Madurai 1600 BC. This is the old part of the city where our walking tour took place. The temple is a mixture of old and new. It was built over a period of 500 years up to C19. The new within the temple highlighted by our guide includes the ceiling painting which is regularly repainted and an optical illusion Shiva ligngam which turns to face you as you change direction. The temple is based on the story of Meenakshi. There are representations of the marriage of Shiva and Meenashi. From the temple tank there was a very impressive view across to one of the towers. It was also possible to see the two anctums covered in gold. Although these are lower then the painted towers, they stand out because of the gold. The 1,000 pillar hall is a highlight. This is the museum area and has better lighting than some areas of the temple. I enjoyed the Yali with a crocodile sculpture and one of a female goddess who looked so fierce she could have been Amazonian. The ivories were interesting, but not well displayed.

After a thali lunch at the hotel we explored the local area. The hotel is in the financial district and it is also a residential area for doctors, lawyersand other professionals. The houses were luxury modern. Most shops were closed for Pongal, but we found a supermarket. In one of the residential streets a temple elephant was wandering with her mahout. We sawhere eatfruit and sugar cane presented by a man in one of the houses and receive a blessing from the elephant - a sort of trunk raising over the head. We paid 20 rupees for our blessing. The elephant received the note in her trunk exactly the same as food and passed it up to the Mahoot.

On the way to Madurai we stopped at a bird sanctuary. My binoculars would have been useful here, but they were not easily accessible. We could identify ibis and egrets, and there were other unidentifieds. In Madurai our first visit was to the flower market. This was very busy because of Pongal. We saw the expensive jasmine, roses in different colours which are imported and garland making. We made a brief photo stop at the tank. Alongside this tank the process of drying cotton after it has been dyed takes place. The tank os a good place for this task because ther is a long enough space without too many people. The main visit was to the palace. This is full of pigeons and not very well looked after, but it is worth taking care of. This is a Nayac palace. Originally it was much larger, but two main halls remain. The columns in the halls are rather stocky, but it is worthwhile to raise your eyes to see the decoration in the Hindu saracenic style. The last part of the sight seeing was to the Ghandi museum. Ghandi visited Madurai several times and on one occasion he decided to adopt the dhoti as his dress - this was part of his connection with all sections and castes of Indian society. The story told in the museum is, as you might expect, not flattering to the British.

After a break at the hotel we took a tuk tuk with our guide for the evening temple procession. We opted to see the procession outside the temple. Before the procession there was time for shopping. Madurai is famous for its tailors. For Westerners the tailors will make up a dress/top or simple trousers. You choose the style and material. The tailors section is in a Mandapan of the temple. I had a dress made up and collected it the same evening. The temple precession included a camel and a bull. The photo shows the image of Meenakshi being carried into the temple.

The first temple in Tanjore is known as the big temple because of it's large sculptures. It is not the biggest temple In the area - see later. The photo shows the two ladies who helped us. We had come from the sanctorum behind and had received from the priest the redscored. The ladies helped us to tie these on correctly. The big temple has an elegant design with sharp corners of the central vimana. At the front there is a huge Nandi (bull) which is a monolith carved from a single piece of stone. The huge cupola on thetool of the vimana is made from eight pieces of granite which were carved in situ. At this temple I particularly noticed that above the carved figures there are mini temples above as a sort of architrave or decorative feature. Our guide also pointed out ""magic"" sculptures. The most famous of these is one showing an elephant and a bull with the head of the elephant and the head of the bull is one head identifiable from a different perspective.

After this temple we visited the palace and library in Tanjore. The library contains early writing carved into palm leaves. I have seen very similar in Buddhist monasteries. The museum in the palace included a collection of bronzes and sculptures. There was more to see here, but the museum was closing for lunch. We drove to Trichy and visitedthe Sri Ranganathaswamy temple. This temple is enormous. There are seven entrance towers. In the outer three areas the Brahmins live and there are shops and businesses. We climbed up for a view that could only capture some of the huge scale of this temple. In this temple the highligwhereas the hall with thepillars carved pillars. These have horses at the top and scenes of fighting below. There is also a small museum with ivories. This museum would benefit from an upgrade.

The light was fading, but there was time for me to climb up to the rock fort for a view over the city. It was rather hazy.

Sore throat so difficult to talk today. On the way we stopped to watch rope being made in a village. I acquired a piece of rope. Im not sure yet what to do with it. his was a day of temples - five in total. I will write about the two that stand out for me. The first is one with a most impossible name Gangaikondacholapuram. Try to say that one out loud a few times! The story behind this temple relates to the river Ganges. This is a Chola temple preserved in green gardens as a UNESCO site. The story of the temple is symbolised by the image of Shiva holding up Ganges. The special feature of this temple is the quality of the carvings.

The second is at Darasuram. Here the special feature is the small size of many of the sculptures. This includes small scenes from the Hindu epics carved into a square panel on the pillars. This temple also included the running elephant as shown on the photo and chariots.

I was sorry to leave Mahaburipuram. I would go back there. We had a friendly guide for Auroville and Pondicherry. Auroville is a strange place- a sort of social experiment that has not really succeeded. There is little to see, but you walk to a viewing point for the Matrimandir which is a gold circular shaped building which is intended to symbolise the heart of the community. Our hotel was in the Tamil Nadhu area of the town, but not far from the French quarter. The hotel was a heritage house with a courtyard at the centre and stained glass window sections over the courtyard. Our afternoon tour of Pondicherry included fairly modern RC churches, French mansions now used for government buildings and posh shops, the Ganesh temple, the ashram and the beach. We were able to go to the sanctum of the temple for the ritual with lamp, bunches of grass or flowers and the priest blessing. For a treat we dined in the hotel. Before dinner there was a cooking demonstration making a dish Okra. We tasted the results. There was another couple at the tasting and we had dinner with them. Sunday is a day for fish in India, so the main course was two types of fish, one was a red snapper or similar. Pondicherry in the tourist areas is green and clean and fairly quiet, so it has a different feel. Indian tourists from the big cities also come for this reason.

I was woken at 7 by drumming and took myself on an exploration before breakfast. I found the procession in the butter ball park. The butter ball is a large boulder which appears to be balanced, but easily moved. This is deceptive, it has stood the test of time. The procession was a small group of men. They collected flowers and leaves and lit a lamp at the Ganesh Ratha. After completing their chants and circle of the Ratha they continued the procession.

With our guide, Mr Ragu, we visited the main sites, starting with Aruja's penance. This is the famous bas relief with animals including elephants, deer, monkeys, birds, dwarves and the cat echoing Aruja's pose surrounded by mice who just might be deceived. The river Ganges is the natural fissure in the rock. We also visited cave temples. A memorable image was of a cow being milked with cows and cowherds nearby and a young flautist above. We continued with a visit to the five Rathas, that can be described as the chariot temples all carved from the same piece of rock. Animals featured here too, a bull, an elephant and a lion. After visiting another cave temple and a viewpoint we finished with a visit to the shore temple. Although this temple was damaged by the Tsunami it has been restored. This temple is the final development of temple architecture to a constructed temple with its vimana tower over the sacred shrine.
This concluded the Mamellapuram tour. We had a short drive to visit a Muslim fishing village. Families were enjoying themselves on the beach and in the water.
After my coffee break (a return to the German bakery cum Napalese tea house) I found myself drawn back to butterball park. I explored the area at the back of the site. This area is popular with Indian tourists but off the beaten track for Westerners. There was a good view from the ""old lighthouse"".

Kanchipuram has over 100 temples. It is not a huge city like Chennai so some of the temples are close neighbours. The first temple was dedicated to Vishnu - Devarajaswami. This temple has a marriage hall with carved pillars (horses) on the left after you pass the entrance tower - gopuram. This is a C16 temple and there are Portuguese influences in the dress of some of the carvings. At the back of the marriage hall you can see the temple tank. This is used for festivals when images of the gods are floated in the tank. It is more like a small lake than a tank. The story associated with this tank is that precious images were hidden in the tank at the time of war to protect them. The temple waited 40 years to drain the tank and uncover the image, but this only lasted 48 days because of another invasion. This is now commemorated by draining the tank every 40 years. The next temple Sri Ekambaranathar has a famous mango tree.

The Kailasantha temple is unlike the other two temples because it is more a monument and less a living temple. This is from the much earlier Pallaver time like tha temples at Mallarapuram. Although this temple has been restored there are many original carvings left and traces of fresco painting.

After visiting a silk weavers the drive to Mahallapuram was not long. We arrived in time to explore. I found somewhere to eat a snack and found myself wondering why it seemed familiar. I saw the Tibetan prayer flags and pictures and found Nepalese food on the menu. Here it is easy to walk around unlike Chennai where the roads are impossible. I took a first look at some of the sights including Arjuna's penance. The late afternoon light highlighted some of the temples. More to come tomorrow. Malabar fish for dinner.

We met our guide and driver this morning. Tamil Nadhu exports flowers, particularly jasmine to South East Asian countries. At the temples flower garlands are for sale. At the first temple which is the oldest in Chennai we learned about Shiva and Parvarti. The information was useful in the evening because there was a music and dance festival. We attended a very professional performance at the music academy with classical Indian music and dancing by a solo female dancer. In one of her dances she took the role of Parvati admiring the form and formlessness of Shiva. Another dance was composed by the flautist in the music group. The dancer had paint on her fingers and toes. Her fingers appeared to bend backwards in some of the gestures. We also visited the modern Roman Catholic cathedral linked to a story about St Thomas and Fort George. Little remains of the fort, but the museum has a collection of portraits of the great and the good from the British Imperialist period balanced by information about some of those who fought for Indian Independence. This included a woman who was involved in the development of the Indian flag. The jewel in the crown of Chennai is the Chola bronzes - lots of them and quite well displayed in the National Museum. In the afternoon we drove out to the Chennai equivalent of Beamish. I expected this to be low key, but it was not just reconstructions. There was architecture and door carving from old mansions and houses. An impressive piece was a chariot with wooden wheels used to pull images of the gods through the town at festival time.

Jet lag today. Journeyed by auto - which I know as a tuk - from the hotel to the sea. Took the lift to the top of the modern lighthouse for a view over the beach and the city. Ginny had made friends with an unusual couple, a glamorous beautifully attired doctor from Uruguay and her young Indian IT specialist friend who is local to Chennai. We had dinner with them at the hotel and ate our vegetarian curries Indian style. A wedding was taking place in the hotel and the lifull and lobbies were full all evening with bright and patterned saris.

Tiger Cave
I spent many hours over several days wandering among the 7th century wonders at Mamallapuram. Carved from single large boulders, stories burst from their surfaces in astonishing detail, rooms chiseled deep into the guts of the rocks appear like naturally occurring symmetrical caves.

The first day I explored, a rock carver tagged along, despite my saying several times ""goodbye"" and ""I want to be alone."" When I realized he was not going away until I visited his ""shop,"" I detoured from my tour for five minutes, followed him on stones rising from a cesspool of muck-which I nearly teetered into, entered his shop, and surveyed his quite ordinary inventory. He expressed indignation that I didn't buy, then shouted at me as I walked away. This was my first day touring in this small town. I sighed, knowing he would be the first of many very assertive vendors I would encounter in the days ahead.

I was able to shake off the aggressive vendor. The exquisite carvings captivated me. I lingered as the sun set, marveling at the immensity of the work depicting various deities and moments in their existence. Other tourists, mostly Indians, happily snapped selfies and used the

Stories abound in this exquisitely carved panel.
rock surfaces for climbing challenges. A small child and his father pushed on ""Krishna's Butterball"", a lonesome giant boulder perched on a slippery rock slope where joyous youngsters used their backsides as temporary sleds. Young couples crept into rock crevices for artful photography work, and perhaps a private space where they could hold each other's hand for a brief moment.

I realized I would never capture photos without human presence at these popular monoliths. So I started to enjoy the human show, and watched and photographed as people climbed upon Nandi the bull, or posed in front of one of the Five Rathas, or sought the perfect selfie with friends, or composed an engaging family portrait. After snapping a family's portrait, they invited me to join them. Me, with my comfortable traveling pants and shirt, amidst Indian women in their gorgeous saris. I heard one of them musing about looking at the photo later and saying ""Yaaru?"" Which essentially means, ""who is that?""

Friend Sanjay took me to the Tiger Cave just outside of town, an unfinished temple with a
Shore TEmple
frame of giant ""tiger"" faces around the alcove carved into a huge boulder. I was alone, save for Sanjay and a lone guide waiting for an unlucky tourist. I felt fortunate to have beaten the bus loads of people. Sanjay showed me a nearby smaller temple, and then a building that had been uncovered by the 2004 tsunami. A later temple of granite had been built over an earlier one of bricks, and made for a curious jumble of structures, only recently discovered and excavated from its overburden of sand.

One should visit the temples of Mamallapuram. Capturing a selfie with these remarkable structures is more or less an expected and effortless activity these days. More elusive is capturing the intent, the purposeful rendering of story and life and exquisite structure in huge, once smooth boulders that waited silently for the chisels.

December 24th 2015

Gopuram Scaffolding
Getting ready for a new paint job.
It's those moments of connection, confusion, or understanding that I relish when I travel. My ultimate joy is laughing with people. The following are moments that I treasure as I continue my journey in India:

Temple Visits

The Arunachaleshwar Temple in Tiruvanammalai is an important destination for pilgrims from all over India. I visited several times. One evening it was crawling with pilgrims, men shirtless and wearing black dhotis, women in red and yellow full-of-shakti-energy saris--all creating a striking contrast with the stone walls and the giant gopurams, or towers, at the temple's entrances. It was the new moon, an auspicious time to visit and pray to the Shiva deities dwelling deep within the inner sanctum spaces.

I joined the clamoring crowd, and was ushered by a river of people to a long table of tiny pots of burning ghee. A woman grabbed me and gathered some unlit pots, placed them on the table, indicated I was to light them, and held out her hand until I filled it with 20 rupees. I duly lit the candles, surrounded by other young women doing the same.

I was later told that unmarried or childless women go to this

place to light the ghee, hoping to be blessed with a good husband and children. We shall see if I am so blessed--having a child would be a true miracle, and acquiring a husband would be just as miraculous!

Language

I always learn a few words in the local language when I travel. I have an advantage with Tamil, because I remember some from my student days in Tamil Nadu 40 years ago.

But I also found that speaking Tamil can lead to misunderstanding. In Tiruvanammalai, I said a few words to an auto rickshaw driver, and immediately became fluent to his mind. He chatted away. I couldn't hear because of the motor noise, and I kept saying I didn't understand but he couldn't hear me. On arrival at my guest house, he smiled and gave me his phone number--I thought in case I wanted to use him again. Soon after I returned to my room, Durga of the guest house knocked on my door and said the rickshaw driver wanted to give me something, and did I know him? No, I said, I just hired him. I thought it was kind of weird he was calling
Devotees with Nandi

me back, so I asked Durga to speak with him. Later she told me that he wanted to give me an invitation to his wedding. He insisted that I had told him I would attend!

On Funny Drivers

Muthu drove me from Mamallapuram to a lovely bird sanctuary, then the next day to Tiruvanamalai, then on to Madurai. So we were together for many hours. I enjoy asking local people questions about their lives. Muthu was my captive as I sat next to him in the front seat, and he answered my probing questions with poise and frankness. He told me about his arranged marriage to his 15 year old niece, stopping school at age 12 and ""working"" by selling peanuts as directed by his father.

""Do you feel anger toward your father for making you work at age 12?"" I asked.

""If he hadn't done that, I never would have met you and other tourists,"" he replied.

He babies his car--his first, purchased two years ago. He is constantly cleaning it, and even put newspaper on top of the mat in the front seat so I would not get the mat dirty! I told

him he needed to name his car. He laughed at the suggestion, but I told him travelers would like that. I suggested ""Jasmine Mobile"" because he likes to hang fresh jasmine from the rear view mirror, which gives the car a heavenly smell. He modified that name to ""Jasmine Car"" and smiled, satisfied.

While traveling in Muthu's Jasmine Car, my phone rang with an unfamiliar caller id number. The woman shouted in Tamil so I handed it to Muthu. He started talking, she kept shouting. Five minutes later he hung up and handed me the phone.

""Who was it?"" I asked.

""She said, 'Why didn't you come? I called you many times, and you never answered. Why didn't you answer? It's not been working for three days!' After a while she calmed down, and I told her I'd be there in 10 minutes.""

""Well, who was it?"" I asked again.

""Some woman, she thinks I am the cable repair man.""

I told Muthu he was a terrible person. He and I laughed a long time about the lady who thought she'd see the cable guy in ten minutes.

I learned a lot of
Muthu Cools my Coffee
Tamil from Muthu. He taught me the disrespectful use of ""mardu"" which means ""cow."" He demonstrated by calling people that word, especially women and old people, as they ambled across the road, forcing drivers to slow down. I got the hang of it very quickly, and together we labeled many a pedestrian ""mardu.""

Making Friends

One can make friends easily here. I like the groups of young women students who walk together. I offer to take a photo of all of them, we chat, they practice their English and giggle a lot, then they want a photo of me with them, and then we're friends!

Muthu and I stopped for lunch in Kumbakonam. I went to a place where they served the traditional thali, the plate of small cups of various vegetables, chutneys, soups, and sambar along with rice and sometimes bread. It was my first restaurant version since arriving, and I was excited to join all the Tamil people in this popular eatery. My waiter identified the spicy selections. But I didn't care, I love spicy! So my hand shoveled it in, and soon my nose was dripping and I was happy. My waiter responded to

Because of recent rains, the place was teeming with bird life.
my Tamil requests for more of some items, and brought me more of things that I didn't want. After eating I asked him to take my photo, all bloated and happy. Then came the question:

""Do you have a Facebook ID?"" he asked. I hesitated, then said no, sorry, I do not use. My friends know I use Facebook.

That's what happens--10 minutes of conversing with someone, and they want to be ""friends"" on Facebook.

In Madurai, while standing on the busy street waiting for my call taxi, a woman and young man walked by and smiled. She pointed to the string of jasmine I had poked in the zipper of my handbag and said, ""You should put in your hair.""

""I don't have hairpins.""

She walked to the vendor nearby, bought some hairpins, and returned.

""Here, I'll put it on you."" She attached the strand atop my head of short hair, framing my face nicely. She smiled, asked my native country and name, and then said, ""Selfie?""

I could not refuse, so now I'm in her selfie catalog, with a strand of white jasmine on the top of my head.

of those Things

Some incidents seem so predictable. My friend Pushpa wanted to help me as I waited for an auto rickshaw on the road in front of her house in Tiruvanammalai.

""Don't do that,"" she says, ""just flag down a motorcycle."" She stopped a passing motor scooter driver and told him to give me a ride to the temple. I hesitated, as I preferred the relative safety of the back seat of the three wheeled rickshaw. But she told me to get on, and the poor guy couldn't get out of it. He was carrying a big container of kerosene or something highly flammable, and there were no pedals on which to rest my feet. But on to the back of the scooter I sat, and held on for dear life. Two minutes and 300 meters later, his scooter sputtered to a halt in the middle of the road. It had run out of petrol. So I was back to waiting on the road for an auto rickshaw! Classic, just classic.

Backwaters Canoe Trip
Geo: 8.08403, 77.5419

After a brilliant week with our tour group we were back on our own. We took a night bus to Kodaikanal via Palani. It rained heavily as we left and we passed an ambulance on its side in the middle of the road! Only in India!
We arrived at 4am into Palani which wasn't pleasant, strong urine smells, rubbish everywhere, dodgy and drunk people all around and a guy hitting a lady in the face.
We got to Kodaikanal in the western ghats where the altitude increased to 2000 masl.
I guess we had high expectations of Kodaikanal but we found that the room was damp and cold, that shops don't open until 11 and to find a non Indian breakfast is a struggle.
We didn't have a very good first impression and after a nap and lunch, it rained heavily for hours.
It wasn't all bad and we liked it a bit more the following morning.
Clear blue skies greeted Kodaikanal which was above the clouds. We went to the lookout near town for some nice views. On a clear day you can apparently see the valley below. We took a walk to the lake which was nice and quiet and offered
Kanyakumari
some nice reflections.

After a brief city tour we headed by bus to Madurai. There were some nice views on the way down of the mountainous western ghats.
Once we arrived we went and visited the Gandhi museum which was great to learn about India under English rule and what Gandhi's role in an independent India was. Very interesting! We visited the main temple complex in which there are five temples, the second highest in India. These temples are extremely detailed and colourful. Entry is free but knees and shoulders need to be covered and cameras aren't allowed but phone cameras are! strange!

We then took our last long hall bus ride to the tip of India, Kanyakumari! We liked Kanyakumari, there is some nice scenery, it's where three seas meet and you can see the sun rise and set over the sea. Many locals come to visit the temples and there is heaps of accommodation. Some of the houses are quite colourful but it is also quite windy.
We upgraded to a hotel with a pool and after a hot day walking around, we enjoyed a pool to ourselves with great views on top of the roof.
Then it was train
Kodaikanal
time back to Varkala!

We Stayed in Varkala in a nice hotel, with a swimming pool, for five great nights. We loved Varkala and enjoyed having our little routine of a sleep in followed by breakfast, chillout, shopping, lunch, chillout, swimming pool, cliffside relaxing, yoga (mostly Anna), dinner then bed.
As the days grew closer to Xmas, it was evident that there were more tourists arriving, foreign and local. On one of the days we did a backwaters tour in a canoe.
This was great! So calm and relaxing with stunning landscape. It was an hour and a half to get there followed by two and a half on the canoe. In the area they grow Banana, Pineapple, Papaya, Jack fruit, Vanilla, Coconut, Pepper and a few more. All that in one area makes for quite a resourceful place.

Varkala is a great place to relax, we were glad to make the decision to come back after the tour.
For our final three nights we stayed in Kovalam just south of Trivandrum. We had just stepped out of the taxi when we bumped in to an old friend randomly, it was a quick but great little reunion.
Kovalam is also a nice area to stay for
Kodaikanal
a few days. There are a few coves, we stayed at lighthouse beach. There is lots of accommodation, seaside restaurants and shopping opportunities. Even surfing!

Christmas was a bit strange there. There were no real menus available for a Christmas meal in the restaurants and the beach was completely packed with locals going on dangerous boat trips whilst drinking. Apparently one person had their arm cut by the motor propeller and we saw one boat capsize.
We did spend a little bit of Christmas Day doing Christmas shopping. Talk about last minute!
In the evening we had a great seafood feast along the beach, a different Christmas meal but amazing!

The next day saw us depart for our final destination, The Maldives!

Entry gopuram
Going to heaven. That's what the December 21 winter solstice is about for devotees at the important Vishnu temples throughout India.My friend Premala told me about this day while I visited her in her home in Madurai. She warned that great crowds of people cram the streets around the Koodal Azhagar Temple in the evening, seeking an opportunity to receive darshan and cross the threshold into heaven. Just once a year, she said, a special doorway is opened, and devotees may pass through, following the Lord Vishnu.I needed to see for myself. The noisy, busy streets of Madurai are unbelievable. I approached the vertically striped red and white granite walls on streets cleared of traffic by police but packed by devotees. Vendors of yellow flowers, sweet smelling jasmine, lotus flowers, and leafy greens lined the curbs. A small twirling children's ride carried toddlers round and round in tiny cars. The roar of giant generators fueled the ride and intensified the cries of the throngs headed toward the five tiered entrance gopuram bedecked by strands of illuminated lights.I sought to watch and remain on the exterior, to avoid getting caught in the rush.
Vishnu being carried around the temple
This is the ""portable"" deity they carry for such occasions.
But as I stood back and enjoyed the bedlam, a man told me I should enter. I pondered just for a moment, and decided that yes, I definitely wanted to enter heaven.I barreled my way to the free shoe storage stand, handed a woman my green Keen sandals. She placed them on the top shelf, where they contrasted so obviously with everyone else's shoes. She didn't even give me a claim number. The only westerner was being given special shoe treatment.Barefoot now and funneled into the queue, I inched along with sari clad women, children, and men, all seeking a glimpse of Vishnu in the inner sanctum. Warm, humid, jasmine scented air enveloped me as I crossed the great entry way. A vividly lighted display dominated the entrance, the carved stone walls reverberated with the buzz of the devotees sitting, standing, moving. Every square foot of space embraced swishing saris, purposeful bare feet, the prancing of children, pilgrims taking prasad, families connecting, energy multiplying. Signs pointed the way to the different ""levels"" of darshan--the glimpsing of the deity. General (free), 5 rupee, and special (20 rupees). The more you pay, the
Vendors selling lotus flowers, greens
closer you get. I joined the general queue, and pushed and shoved my way along to the elevated platform where I glimpsed far away Vishnu--known in this temple as Lord Koodal Azhagar. Shrouded in white and yellow flower garlands, he peered from the protective inner sanctum at his human devotees.Joining the human river again, I shuffled my way out the entry across the threshold, then sucked in the cool air. I did it! I'm surely going to heaven now. I phoned Premala and gushed that I was on the fast track to heaven. She shared my elation.
Now the queue to enter the temple was 30 times longer and curled around the temple walls. I gave thanks that I had beat the main rush. But the excitement had just begun.After wandering the streets and back alleys, I circled the block back to the main entrance gopuram. I joined the people milling about and seated along the road. They were waiting, waiting for the ""portable"" deity to exit the temple and process down the street.From my slightly elevated viewpoint I could hear first then see him coming--the crowd roared, the energy
Crowds strain to see Vishnu
rippled through the onlookers and pulsed through my body. Aloft on a raft atop men's shoulders, the flower garlanded deity rocked down the street, growing larger, flashing gold and red and blue jewels as he approached. A giant fan of peacock feathers waved near him. People craned their necks, cameras popped high into the air, breathing grew rapid, and the air vibrated intensely. He paused in front of me, the image sliced the thick air, and I beheld the deity. He lumbered on, people shoved, priests in their white dotis protected, a speaker blared music. Then suddenly a rush of frantic energy erupted, the crowd roared, the river splashed and tumbled. A policeman blew his whistle, failing to control the crowd that threatened to roll atop one another. I gave thanks for being protected in my stationary position just beyond the human flow. The energy softened, the crowd calmed, danger dissipated. I watched the deity round the corner beyond and disappear.Exhilaration filled my being. Rarely have I had the opportunity to share in such an event. I understand better now why devotees seek these experiences, braving the numbing traffic and absence of personal boundaries. Together, we joined
Devotees at Temple Door where Vishnu Passes

in transcending our humanness, and touched the divine.

Biceps
We each checked out the other's biceps. Ramesh diplomatically said I had some. His were far more impressive!
I marched through the gate between the beach and the posh resort at Mamallapuram, seeking a fancy restaurant experience. Having just adopted a tortoise, I needed to celebrate.

My baggy pants, casual blouse, floppy hat, and lack of gold jewelry must have given me away as an outsider. A voice behind me called, ""Excuse me madam, can I help you?"" I turned around, and there was Ramesh, a man whom I would come to know in this small coastal city.

""I just wanted to have lunch here,"" I said.

""Where do you want to eat? We have two restaurants,"" he said, then added, ""the entrance from the beach is just for resort guests.""

I appreciated his polite tone. He asked where I was staying. I named my guest house, then asked him in Tamil if he knew the place. Speaking Tamil usually disarms people right away, and it seemed to work this time. He told me his name, grabbed my hand, and warmly shook it. He said he was the lifeguard.

""You look like you would be the lifeguard,"" I said as I surveyed the size of
Fisherman's Colony

his biceps. Although short in stature, he looked very strong. He flashed a brilliant smile, then directed me to the restaurant.

After I ate, I decided to walk out through the beach entrance. Since I had met Ramesh already, surely he wouldn't mind. I found him looking at a big bag of flowers, the discards from a wedding from the previous day.

""A waste, really,"" he commented. Then we talked, and talked, and the more we talked, the more I grew to like this man. Ramesh had a story, as everyone has, but his story touched me deeply. Maybe it was the way he told it, in a reserved, humble fashion. Or maybe it was just knowing that here was indeed a very special man, with a heart probably bigger than his biceps.

Soon into the conversation Ramesh told me he had rescued 40 people in the eight years he had worked there. Swimming in that area can be treacherous, due to strong currents.

""Were you trained as a lifeguard?"" I asked.

""No training. I am a fisherman,"" he said. ""I know the waves, and the currents, and the behavior of the ocean, I know
Ramesh and his stretch of beach
all this, and that's how I can be a lifeguard."" For 18 years he practiced the skills of a fisherman, passed down to him through generations.

The tsunami of 2004 changed everything for him, as it did for most of the fishermen in Mamallapuram. He lost everything--his boat, motor, nets--his livelihood was gone. Then donors contributed fiberglass boats, replacing the wooden boats that the fisherman had used. There weren't enough for each fisherman, so five people shared one boat, a scheme that did not work well.

Ramesh decided to seek a job as a lifeguard at the resort, and his days as a fisherman were over.

""I miss fishing. I miss the boat. I am bored with my work at times."" He grew wistful, then continued, telling me more about the rescues. He told me of one man that he pulled ashore, still alive and talking, but who laid down and died before medical help arrived. It bothered him, I could tell, but then I thought of all the others who owed their lives to his knowledge of the ocean and his actions.

At 38 years, Ramesh is proud of his work. Six days a week,
Fisherman's Colony street
nearly nine hours a day, he watches for the tourists, resort guests or not, who stray too far from shore in the ocean.

He invited me to his home to meet his family, wife Bhavani and four year old Sadhana, and his mother. The next evening I visited his small home in the Fisherman's Colony again, and savored delicious fried fish and a fish curry prepared by Bhavani. We talked and talked, and Ramesh and Bhavani were warm, open, and shared much about their lives. Their marriage was arranged, but they grew to love one another and seem happy. Although Bhavani does not speak much English, she writes it, while Ramesh speaks English but does not write. They've worked it out.

There are some people whom you meet and forget in a second, even though you may have chatted for an hour. Then there are people like Ramesh. He has found a special place in my heart. I knew him for less than 48 hours, but when we parted, I told him I felt as if I had known him for a long time.

Aldabra giant tortoise
At age 62 I became a mom. Again. But this time, my child had a hard shell, retractable head, and four feet. And I have to admit that it was unplanned. Here’s how it happened:

Mamallapuram is best known for its remarkable carved rock temples scattered throughout this small coastal city. But about 20 kilometers north of town is The Madras Crocodile Bank Trust, where thousands of crocodiles representing nearly 20 of the world's species are given safe haven in murky pools. Snakes lizards, turtles, and land dwelling tortoises join the extensive collection of all things reptile. In addition, men from the Irula caste demonstrate the fascinating work of extracting venom from poisonous snakes.

A shady path skirts pools lined with high walls. Signs warn visitors not to stick their hands over the top, because crocs can jump! I wasn't tempted, however, to test the warning as I strolled the grounds with Sanjay, who drove me there on his motorbike.

Next to the cage with the reserve's biggest croc was an enclosure with a handful of Aldabra giant tortoises, native to the Seychelles islands. A big sign indicated they were available for ""adoption."" A generous

donor had already adopted the huge croc, giving enough money to feed the big guy for a year. And since he eats emus and chickens and other meat, the diet can get expensive. I asked one of the staff nearby, ""How much to adopt a tortoise for a year?"" I've always had a soft spot in my heart for turtles and tortoises, so I was curious.

""Three thousand rupees,"" he replied.

I did the conversion in my head--only about thirty dollars. I looked in my wallet, and without hesitation, said, ""I want to adopt one."" I even knew which one I wanted to feed, the smallest one in the pen, who probably weighed 300 pounds.

He smiled, called the reserve's business manager, and I was happy. A tortoise! My very own...They would put my name on the sign, ""Proudly adopted by...."" right outside the pen.

In fifteen minutes I was talking with the young business manager.

""He said it was three thousand for a tortoise, right?""

""Actually,"" he said slowly, ""it's forty thousand for two."" I didn’t think, I was just elated that I was adopting a big
Croc relaxing
tortoise.

""Okay, I can do one."" We went to his office, sat, and I pulled out my calculator...let's see, 20,000 rupees divided by 66 at the current exchange rate...I kept punching the numbers in the calculator, but it kept coming up $303.00. My breathing grew shallow, and again not thinking I said, ""Oh, that comes to over $300. That's a lot..."" knowing full well I wasn’t carrying that much money and, that was like, let's see...ten times more than I thought initially!

The manager was going on about how great it was that I was adopting a tortoise, and how badly they needed people like me to donate because most people would rather adopt a cuddly tiger. Meanwhile, I was getting this sinking feeling. Then I stopped and scolded myself. For goodness sake, here I was traveling in India for five weeks and I thought I couldn’t afford to feed a tortoise for a year? It was a question that every traveler should ask herself...

""Do you take credit cards?"" I asked.

""Not here in the office, but online we do.""

No problem then. I pledged to complete the paperwork
A croc retirement home
and forward the money to feed the Aldabra giant tortoise. I was feeling good about supporting this non-profit reserve that plays a critical role in reptile conservation in India. And, there were perks! I’d get a tee shirt and a photo of me and my tortoise! Really cool...and maybe I could visit my tortoise, work with it perhaps (maybe I could train him/her to do sit ups or play fetch??), and do a number of activities at the reserve.

I was so proud and excited that I went directly to the most expensive place in Mamallapuram for a celebratory lunch. I ordered the catch of the day and a lime soda, and settled at my seaside table. Then I checked my wallet. Not enough cash. I was drumming my fingers, listening to the waves crash in the ocean, feeling the cool breeze, but repeating the turmoil that I had just experienced at the reserve. I distracted myself by recalling all the cool movies where the suave leading man, through some clever ploy, gets out of paying his bill at a fancy restaurant.





Except this was real--I really didn't have rupees, and I would soon
Cobra tells about the snake inventory
receive a hefty bill. But I had some dollars—could I pay with those? The restaurant manager approached my table and said they only took rupees. I was getting more embarrassed by the second, confided that I was a couple hundred rupees short, and joked that I must have been confused because I was carrying some Cambodian bills that I thought were rupees. The manager wasn't laughing. He instead rolled his eyes, and tried to decide whether he should kick me out right then. Meanwhile, my catch of the day was cooking. I started looking around at other well-dressed resort guests with their gold chains and silk saris, wondering if I could ask someone if they could change some dollars for me. I was painfully aware of my baggy pants, floppy hat, wind-tossed, tangled hair and sweaty blouse—having just ridden a motorbike for 20 kilometers from the reserve.



Then I remembered. I had this wonderful thing called a credit card in my wallet. I pulled it out. The manager and the head hostess standing there waggled their heads, indicating they’d take it, and suddenly all was well. But the crashing waves weren't really as soothing as they had

been when I first sat down.

After I left the grounds of this posh resort, my excitement grew. A tortoise! Even though it would never call me ‘Mom,’ congratulations were in order, yes?

Choose one: Congrats for (A) becoming a new tortoise mom, or (B) figuring out how to pay for the catch of the day.

December 11th 2015

The Headless Santa
Right outside the entrance to the tomb of St. Thomas
There's something about the first few hours traveling in a foreign country. I've felt it so many times--exhaustion from the long flight, unsettled stomach, a bit of anxiety, eagerness and excitement over embracing a new adventure. But these first few hours--the day after I landed in Chennai--were different.

It is, after all, my triumphant return to India. I first visited 40 years ago as a university student, hungry for a cultural experience, a bit naive and searching for some kind of personal enlightenment. Our group of 18 students from mid western US schools went straight to Madurai back then, to study Tamil and the culture, or at least that's how we started. That less-than-scholarly experience (most of us were not very disciplined students) somehow tied me to the place. I was drawn back twice since that time. And now, 40 years older, I'm returning again to reconnect to the people, the places, and most importantly, to my Indian friends from long ago.



My anxiety about negotiating this city of nine million people evaporated as I allowed Chennai to take me in. It started with the family members at Springhaven--the bed and breakfast place where I am staying.
Interior of St. Thomas cathedral
They are all very kind, and cluck over me like mother hens.

""There's a wedding today, you can attend,"" one of the women said to me as I staggered into the sitting area before breakfast. Wedding? Less than seven hours after landing? I mulled this idea in my head, thinking about all the other things I wanted to do--change money, get my mobile phone set for action in India. And I was so tired, and battling a cold that had wanted to explode for over a week now. But how often does one get to attend an Indian wedding?

""I don't have any clothes!?""

""No problem, we'll put you in a sari.""



Then as suddenly as the opportunity arose, it dissolved for some reason. So instead, I donned my favorite salwar-kameez outfit, and planned to do errands. Three family members then worked together to engage a tuk tuk for me--go to the bank, get the SIM card for the phone, go to the temple, the beach. All set--the driver understood everything, he would drop me at the temple at the end.

I told the driver in Tamil that I knew a little Tamil.
Gopuram in the Kapaleshwarar temple
Undergoing painting for the upcoming festival.
The house host commented that I could speak Tamil--I emphasized ""a little"" and she said, well, that's more than enough to survive. I had said five words, and now I was fluent. I asked how to say ""stop"" in Tamil--the house host told me, then laughed and said the driver knows how to say ""stop"" in English. Then I tried to get in the tuk tuk from the wrong side--or the right side, if I were in the US, where they drive on that side of the road. The family gathered there laughed as I set off.

""I'm in the wrong country,"" I said.

And off we went, zipping around corners, weaving through vehicles, motorbikes--my driver was a master, making impossible turns and leapfrogging over obstacles. I'm having a blast, I thought, this is just perfect. I'm really back in India! My happiness grew as we careened among vehicles and potholes.

At the mobile phone shop, they made me hand over my passport, give a photo of myself, sign everything in triplicate, provide my father's name, and promise my first born son to them. All to get a SIM card so I can have a local phone
The Necklace of thorny leaves
number. When my passport disappeared out the door, I was worried, just for a minute. It came back after they had copied the visa inside. I gave them about $1.50, they inserted the card into my phone, then told me it would not be activated for five days. Great. Within a minute of purchasing, the driver handed me his cell phone. It was the bed and breakfast host, saying my friend had phoned her and told her to contact me and say that he had a phone for me that I could borrow while traveling for my five weeks in India.

By this time I was marveling at how nearly 15 new people were suddenly involved in my life, trying to make things easier for me, trying to help me accomplish things, in a strange, round about fashion. That's travel in India.

Chennai just suffered massive flooding--the once in a century kind. I expected problems in moving about, but my first few hours spinning around the city in a tuk tuk were trouble free. Sort of. My driver dropped me at the bank, said he had to tend to a family emergency, then sped off. The bank didn't
Scaffolding behind a shrine
The white haired guide demonstrated perambulation of each little shrine, and many had scaffolding around them from the festival preparation. I had to duck..
change dollars, so I got the guy standing outside, guarding the entrance, to help me hire another tuk tuk to take me to another money changing place, then the temple. Off I went again, finally got dropped at the big temple. A white haired man latched on to me as I walked around, showing me how to pay respect to each deity enshrined around the grounds, guiding me around each building, ducking under scaffolding and walking through cow poo. He placed a strand of leaves around my neck and tucked it into my neckline. It felt like thorns, and I peeled off green leaves that had plastered themselves to my chest for the next several hours.

Another tuk tuk driver then took me to the beach, and St. Thomas Cathedral Basilica, dedicated to St. Thomas, one of the twelve apostles, who died as a martyr there. Outside the tomb where his finger bone fragment is enshrined, was a headless statue of Santa Claus. With his pants fallen around his ""feet"". So startled was I that I could not enjoy the museum where a fragment of the spear that killed St. Thomas is preserved. Thank goodness I saw the headless
I asked for a blessing
...I touched his trunk....
Santa after I enjoyed the impressive interior of the cathedral.

Then of course the tuk tuk driver threw me his pitch of visiting some shops so he could get free petrol.

""NO,"" I insisted. ""No shops."" I knew the drill. He then said he'd reduce the price of the ride if I did it. So soft willed me, I gave in, and spent five agonizing minutes--the minimum needed--in two shops while the people inside gave me the hard sell and followed me around like puppy dogs. The driver got his petrol.

I was barely conscious after my whirlwind tour.

I guess the headless Santa made it all worth it. That, and the tuk tuk pulling the cart selling ""American sweet corn, riche testy steam corn.""

November 20th 2015
Published: November 20th 2015


IMG 1
Ooty- A well known hill station and a dream destination of many, including me. Being in a close place like Coimbatore, I was waiting for the day to visit Ooty.

The day came as an Easter Bonanza when we had a meeting there. I tailored a 3 day plan to Ooty, admitting 5 other colleagues. We made the booking of hotels, cabs and etc.

On the day, we all gathered together at Gandhipuram Bus stand from where our cab driver took us. It was 6 in the morning; we drove through Kurumbapalayam, Karamadai to reach Mettupalayam. Here, we had our breakfast. Then, off to the paradise of hills.

The route from Mettupalayam to Ooty is very scenic though curvy roads hit you and make you feel sick. The driver gave a ‘matured’ ride to us. The windy roads, the drizzles, the sun that playing hiding behind the clouds most of the time, the green environment, the fresh and chill air all together make your ride an amazing one. You may have clogged ears due to pressure of air and cold as you drive upwards. There are many hair pin bends throughout the way that make your drive wavier.

Around half past 8 we reached Coonoor. It was chillier than Mettupalayam. Some of the place covered with mist. We drove straight to Ooty, to attend the meeting at 10.

The clock struck 1, when we came out of the meeting hall. Now, we had the half day and other 2 whole days for Ooty. We drove to our hotel and dumped our luggage in our respective rooms.

Now, time to explore Ooty.

Our first destination was Ooty Rose garden. After buying the tickets, we hopped in the garden. The garden was full of roses. Roses of many colours, a treat to eyes. Some of the roses were very big, to our surprise. Most of roses were getting brown and dried due to the cold weather. There were some photographers who mocked the people for the photographs.

Then, we drove to Ooty Lake for some boating. The place was near and took just 10 minutes to reach. There was so much crowd and we struggled to park our vehicle. Somehow, after the parking, we bought tickets for us and the camera. We went in. There was another ticket counter for the boating. We took tickets
IMG 3
for motor boat that costed us Rs. 450.

We boarded the boat and off to go with the aisle of the trees at the both sides. We saw some ducks playing the water. The climate was chill and the ride made it more chilly. A windy ride it was. The ride was of 20 minutes, after which we came out to have some snacks to warm ourselves. We all grabbed coffee and hot chocolate each and walked though the bank. There were many attractions and games for children and adult. There was also a mini toy train which goes along the lake, a major attraction for the kids. After some time we came out to see the horses that were available for riding. They charged Rs.200 for half an hour which seemed costlier to us, so we dropped the plan of horse riding. The temperature started dropping so we ran back to our hotel. On way we stopped at a local Chai wala.. He offered us Varkees to taste. God.. that was the delicious snack complementing the tea. We ordered for more and bought 2 kgs of varkees atleast each for home.

Our next day tour plan started
IMG 4
with Government Botanical Garden. We wanted to give this place more time. The botanical garden established in a huge area that covered all types of flora you can name. There were exotic kind of plants and trees. Huge trees will bring your mouth wide open. Some of the plants dates back to years and grab special attention in the garden. At one side of the garden, there were topiaries of the many shapes that become the photo shoot destination. There’s also a sales outlet where saplings were sold. There was a big sitting lawn, but was wet due to drizzling. We didn’t sit though we wanted to. Still some people were sitting and kids were playing on that. We came out.

After that we drove towards Doddabetta peak. The way became steep as we climbed up. There were large eucalyptus trees at either sides of the road. The fragrance of the eucalyptus filled the air.

On the way we stopped at Doddabetta Tea factory. The tea factory was built in the midst of the Nilgiri hills. We walked up to reach the factory. Once we are inside, we could feel the warmth of the running machines. First we
IMG 5
saw the leaves were getting filtered on a long steel bed. It is then, dropped down to the rollers to get rolled, fermented and then fried. The noise and the fragrance of the rollers and tea filled the place. It is amazing to see how the tea has been processed from tender leaves to a matured, fermented quality tea powder. There is section where the roasted leaves are separated to add flavours. They use many flavours like, elaichi, chocolate, ginger, masala (spices), etc. Then, at the end everyone is offered free tea for tasting. The tea gave refreshment out the tiredness due to cold. After the tea, we came out to move into the chocolate making section. We bought some chocolates and then, few eucalyptus oil (Nilgiri Oil) from a sales outlet.

The next stop was Doddabetta peak. We parked our vehicle at the base and walked up to the view point. The walk was little tiring. The peak was worth seeing. The whole place was covered with mist. We were kind of shivering. We walked to the point and the tip of the sight. There was deep valley in front of us that was covered with mist all
IMG 6
mist. We couldn’t see anything other than the white mist. There was a telescope tower but was not in use, as we could not see anything clearly.

We were literally shivering now so, climbed down straight to our hotel. We had our brunch and then drove towards Pykara falls. The route was very scenic and cold. First we reached the lake. The view of the lake was very good. It was calm and flowed smoothly. We sat there for some time to enjoy the nature. Some were into boating. After spending some relaxing and peaceful time at the lake we came to the falls with a few minutes’ walk. The waters were dropping itself with a big roar. It was breathtaking and our heart skipped a beat. The roar of waters filled our ears. It was amazing. Spending our quality time there, we moved back to our hotel.

The next morning, we checked out after the breakfast and drove to Coonoor (that was missed while coming).

The first thing we did was to visit the Dolphin’s nose point, because we heard we could see Catherine falls from here. So, we reached the place. To our relief, there was a clear sky. We saw the torrent of Catherine falls. It looked beautiful. It deserved lot of clicks from our cam.

Then we moved to SIMS Park. This was the small version of Ooty Botanical Garden as there was wide range of Fauna. We went through all the sky long trees and exotic plants there. There were some beautiful flower plants and the crotons. There I saw a tree which has turned into a rock and also a Rudraksha tree among the various trees. It was quite a big park, with three levels of steps. At the bottom, there was a lake with boating facility.

After spending an hour there, we moved out to drive back to Coimbatore.

My daughter Thakshima was enjoying her summer vacation of the month May. One fine morning she ran towards me with the Hindu. She pointed out a picture and asked to read the content. The news was about the flower show in Ooty. She requested me deeply to take her to the flower show and her mother also was supporting her. So, our Ooty trip was decided.

We already had tripping experiences with Aaditya travels of Cochin. So, I rang up to the manager and fixed the date. Our plan was to stay for 3 days. During our discussion he mentioned about their new branch in Coimbatore. So, this time our plan was to reach Coimbatore from Mumbai (our hometown).

As usual this time also the agency people were perfect and they were on time at the Coimbatore Airport. Picked us and took us to the office. Manager received us and our friendly talk went on some time. Then he gave some directions to the driver and guide and gave a perfect start to our trip.

Guide Premkumar detailed us about the route. We understood that from Coimbatore there are different routes to reach Ooty.And he was following the route: Coimbatore – Mettupalayam – Coonoor – Kotagiri – Ooty. We travelled through 84kms within 2.45hrs and reached at 1pm.

Ooty the land of scenic beauty welcomed us with it’s cool hands and colonial charm. Thakshima was very anxious to see the flower show. So, quickly finished our lunch and rushed to the flower show. Beautiful flower decoration was made with wonderful collection of rose flowers, imported shrubs and rare flowering plants. Flower show amazed us and no words to explain.

Next reached the Botanical Garden. Premkumar was flawless with the information. Thakshima noted many points and said that she will be using this in her future Botony Project. Botanical garden spreads over 55 acres. Along the beautifully trimmed green lawns people were resting and enjoying the cool breeze. Garden becomes precious and priceless with the rare tree species like : the cork tree , paper bark tree and the monkey puzzle tree (monkeys cannot climb this tree) , a 20 million year old fossilized tree stunned everybody.

An Italian style garden was bordering a small pool. Thakshima touched the water and sprinkled on us. Garden is maintained by the Horticulture Department of the government looks pretty with : orchids – flowering bushes – plants in myriad hues and vast range of ferns.

At the exit shops were very busy in selling the tea varieties. We were also stopped by a seller and he repeated the words “fine quality with reasonable rate” inorder to catch our attention. Bought one packet and said bye. Altogether the flower palace stuck in the memory of one who had visited.

Outside shops were crowded with the people drinking hot tea with snacks. We also joined them and refreshed. Time was 7.00pm. After a shopping through the crowded streets and in busy shops our dinner time reached. Hotel “Lakeview Ooty” fulfilled our dinner and night halt.

We woke up with the tasty tea cups of “Lakeview” and enjoyed the breakfast. Premkumar detailed us the day’s plan and prepared us accordingly. That day our first target was Ooty Lake – boat house. Premkumar made the arrangements for boating and Thakshima wanted to go for a pony ride. She was excited a lot ‘coz that was her first ride on a pony.

Next reached Doddabetta Peak at 12.30pm. Doddabetta is the highest mountain at 2,637m in the Nilgiri hills. The thick forest area around provides an extraordinary look to Doddabetta. Premkumar took us to the Telescope House. I raised Thakshima and asked about the view. She was unusually talkative and said “the whole land looks great with greenish coated tiny slopes and hills”. The entire view provided amazing scenery to our eyes. Turned back to Ooty town and had our lunch.

On the way to the Wax world museum our camera had received attractive pictures. The wax statues entertained Thakshima and clicked some statues.Our visit ended quickly ‘coz we planned three more spots on that day.

Next was rose garden. “GOVERNMENT ROSE GARDEN” an arch welcomed us. The name suits the collection throughout. Along with rose

other rare flowers and their arrangement made the place a small heaven. Our camera enjoyed more pictures.

Evening time we wanted to spend at a nearby lake. So, reached Avalanche lake. The pretty lake was flowing calmly and that evening had spoken many things about the trees and plants surrounded the lake. As well as about the birds and water lives therein. A colourful evening went on and we reached hotel Lakeview at 8.45pm.One more night was shared with hotel Lakeview. Next day after breakfast we were ready for our journey.

STONE HOUSE – the name shows that there are many hidden aspects inside. This thought pulled us towards the stone house. SONE HOUSE or the KAL BANGALA was the oldest first bungalow constructed in Ooty.It was built by John Sullivan and tree in the front is known as Sullivan’s Oak. Thakshima hugged Sullivan’s Oak and kissed with her tender lips. In Tamil the word “kal” refers stone. Stone house reflected the tribal influence here and there. Today it is celebrated as the residence of the Principal of the Government Arts College – Ooty.

The fantastic stone works created a new atmosphere we ever faced. Thakshima had many points to note down as she wished to save this in her

“TRIP MEMORIES”. Till afternoon we were in the Stone house. Then after lunch went to the Thread Garden and Pykara lake. Said good bye to Ooty and the driver dropped us at Airport .Time was 8pm.

Ooty !! A place which is much attracted by tourists. We had heard of Ooty many times, especially, when we learn about Ooty flower shows in botanical garden or about rose garden. It was a place which I wanted to see once in my whole life time.

So, I waited for the opportunity and it came. It was when Tamil Nadu Government announced its 117th flower show in 2013. I was eagerly waiting to visit it. So, I booked an indica from Coimbatore. I had planned for 3 days trip. One of my friends, Mahima also joined me.


So, the day came. We both landed at Coimbatore Airport. our driver was waiting for us. We directly moved to Ooty. In around 1 hour we had reached Mettupalayam, where we started feeling the chillness. We were moving up towards Ooty. We encountered the first thing was the hair pin bends which was 14 in total. We climbed up; we could see the hills covered with forests and the clouds. It was an amazing view. In around 3 hours we reached Coonoor. We broke our fast in Coonoor with hot idlis and coconut chutney.

After that our driver took us to visit Dolphin’s nose Point and SIMS Park before moving up to Ooty. We moved towards Dolphins nose view point. We end up at a point. From there we saw a whole range of hills in front of us, from where many little falls where flowing. We could see Catherine falls from here. It was covered with clouds and mist. It looked amazing.

Then, we moved to SIMS Park. SIMS was another great attraction. We saw lot of people in SIMS park. It was flooded with trees and shrubs and etc. There we saw a tree which has turned into a rock and also a Rudraksha tree among the various trees. It was quite a big park. At the bottom, there was a lake with boating facility. Then, we moved to rest a while, so, we booked with a hotel and spent our night there.

The next day from there we climbed up to Ooty. It was around 20 kms. Coonoor to Ooty gives an amazing view. We faced problems with the road conditions at some places and also it was very narrow way. We went through Wellington ground (where army men were playing).

When we reached Ooty it was past noon. We had our lunch at Saravana Bhavan. Mahima ate little because she had vomiting issues. So, we moved to Government rose garden. After paying the entrance fees of Rs. 30 we stepped into Rose garden. It was a big garden, filled with rose flowers of different ranges and colours. It was amazing to see. After clicking lot of pics of roses we sat at the park for some time.

Then, the place of our interest was next destination, the Government Botanical Garden. It was a huge garden. A big board with ‘117th Annual Flower Exhibition’ welcomed us. We went through the isle of flowers kept in a neat manner. We were gazing through each variety. There were many people, it was so much crowded. We saw many varieties of exotic flowers. It was really a vast area. There was a house inside where the authorities were selling seeds and saplings. There was also a glass house (which we had seen in many movies) in which we could see some rare kind of flowering plants. They were beautiful to see. We bought a hot chocolate each from the kiosk and sat down on the lawn.

After relaxing there for hours we moved to boat house. After buying the tickets we moved in. There was a tiny counter for the ticket for boating. There were four types of boating, row boats, pedal boats (one with 2 seater and another 4 seater) and motor boats (8 seater). We booked for pedal boat. We were looking through the sceneries and the people of other boats, waving hi! to them. 2 hours just passed by.

We then moved out towards the Ooty bus station. We then quickly moved forward to Doddabetta Peak. It was a steep way. My driver found difficult to move up with the fog covered the place. Somehow, we reached up to Doddabetta. We parked our vehicle at the base from where we had to go by walk. We climbed up steps to reach the top. It was so much tiring. But the the chillness made us to move forward to keep our body warm. We reached the top. The scene from here was beautiful. We went to the tip of the peak (so much rocky which was slippery due to fog). From the tip of the peak we saw a deep valley. It was so much cold that we were literally shivering. But, it was the beauty of the place which grabbed us to stay. After a while when the mist became so dense that it hit us as a drizzle, we quickly moved out of that place.

The climate was dropping down. We reached Ooty and booked a room in a hotel. We really were in need of hot water bath.

The next day, we headed towards Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. On the way, we saw a falls called, Pykara. It was a breath taking falls. the water flow was heavy. It was a thrilling experience. the drizzles were hitting us and made chill.

After about more than an hour, we moved towards Mudumalai National Park through Gudalur. When we reach there a big entrance named Mudumalai Tiger Reserve welcomed us. The forest officer told us that they have safaris only twice a day. We waited for our turn. When our turn came we were all carried by a jeep towards the jungle.

The jungle safari was amazing. Initially we saw some wild rabbits and then wild squirrel. After driving through for some minutes we heard the elephants. Woow.. !! Thrilled totally thrilled. Then we realized the guide was actually taking us to place where elephants were. We were ready with our cameras and a bit scared. As we neared the voice of elephants increased. The guide was telling us something but nothing I heard. I was fully focused into the elephants. Then, they showed up. they were 4 in total with a small bay elephant that looked so cute. The elephants looked majestic. T'was a great experience to see the animals in their own habitat. Then, We moved forward to see wild boars, spotted deer, peacocks, stag, langurs and yeah a bison. The noises of birds and other creatures surrounded us. The journey to jungle to see 'Jungli' animals ended with a spot of a snake that crossed the road just in front of our vehicle.

While returning we came through Masinagudi, where we found a steep road ahead. It was like a roller coaster ride. So, our driver was moving slowly.

Then with this whole journey and adventure we headed back to Coimbatore via Kotagiri (as the roads were diverted towards Kotagiri at night). At Kotagiri we had our dinner. From Kotagiri we again moved towards back home to Coimbatore through Mettupalayam.

NB: Just wanna say that the whole trip was a successful because of a man who was keen in our safety and a fun packed tour. Mr. Nirmal (08682947494), the one who arranged a safe vehicle with reliable driver for us. Thank him...

Ooty is the most attractive place places in India. Known as Queen of Hills, it is covered with mist and clouds most of the time. It also looks good when it drizzles. So, ‘Queen of Hills’ is famous as Tourists destination. Here is my first time experience with Ooty. it was my cousins and me who planned the trip to Ooty. We were totally 6 people. At first we planned the routes to reach Ooty.

Then we found to reach Ooty there are five ways:

1) Through Mettupalayam- Coonoor to Ooty (96.6 kms , 2 hrs 45 mins)

2) Through Mettupalayam – Kothagiri to Ooty (93.7 kms, 2 hrs 48 mins)

3) Through Karamadai-Manjoor to Ooty (122 kms, 3 hrs 33 mins)

4) Through Bandipur- Gudalur to Ooty (80 kms, 2 hrs 20 mins)

5) Through Bandipur- Masinagudi to Ooty (49.7 kms, 1 hr 37 mins)

People usually take Mettupalayam- Coonoor or Bandipur-Gudalur/Masinagudi routes very often.

We were not intended to take the usual route (We booked with a travel (08682947494), who gave this advice of taking the other route). So, took the Karamadai- Mulli- Manjoor route. We started early from Coimbatore in
317439_222592504472284_1145929852_n
our Innova and travelled through Anaikatti and Manjoor. The road was awesome. We went through a deep jungle and the view was breathtaking. There were 43 hair pin bends but not very dangerous. We also saw a dam at a hair pind bend which was quite far away.

Then, we stopped at Manjoor to have our refreshment though we carried lots of snacks with us and we have preserved them for future need. Three of my cousins vomited. So, we got into a local stall. We had our chaya with some buns. Then, we proceeded on. The Manjoor-Ooty route is the most beautiful route and less populated. Most of the time we found ourselves alone on the route, only accompanied by some bikers, who were crossing us most of the time.

It was 9 am when we reached a two way road. The left one went to Avalanche lake and another straight to the Ooty. We chose the left one. We passed by a Forest rest/guest house. we had to drive through a forest to reach the lake. As, we reached there, we found the whole paradise in front of us. We hopped to the bank of the
317783_222601154471419_241544559_n
lake. It was beautiful. It was silent and isolated. We were all in our early 20s so, we feared a bit. But, elder ones like me took the in charge and warned all not to do anything that could land us in danger. They all agreed. After taking lot of pics we moved to our vehicle. We drove back to the main road.

We had travelled for minutes, when we saw Emerald Lake and stopped our vehicle there. It was as beautiful as Avalanche Lake. after taking pictures we started moving forward. We were bit hungry at this juncture. So, grabbed some biscuits and chips packets to fill our stomach, hoping it will help. Then, we moved forward.

It was about 11 when we reached Palada, which was at the outer parts of Ooty. We saw a big palace like building. We were stunned by its infrastructure. We stopped and got of the vehicle to give it a shot. Then, we saw an arch on which ‘Good Shepherd International School’ was written. We were astonished. We kept staring at the school. We then moved from there with an awe. We entered into Ooty.

We went through Muthorai to reach Fernhills Palace. It was wonderful and splendid. it was built in a huge area and covers acres of land, which includes garden and in the middle, the palace. It was previously owned by ‘Maharaja of Mysore’ which was then turned into a luxury hotel. it looks amazing. this part of Ooty holds the most beautiful panoramic view followed by the route to Pykara falls.

We then drive towards Ooty, when we were stopped by the magnificent Avalanche hill. We took lot of shots. Then, we moved to Ooty main area. There we found the one, which we were pleased to see. It was Thendral restaurant and we were starving. We rushed to the restaurant. We had breakfast of idli, dosa and sambhar with coconut chutney. It was delicious. We had a filter coffee too.

After our delicious breakfast we moved to Rose garden. It has started drizzling. We crossed Ooty race course area to and reached Rose garden. Unlike other rose gardens, it gives a great view. In front there was a beautiful garden and at the background the range of hills which was covered with mists or clouds. We saw some of the exotic variety of roses. Very big and very small. Roses in every possible colour. The garden was in the terrace form. So, we had to move from one section to another. There were sitting areas too. Most of the people were resting there. we went through each section with taking pictures as much as we could. We sat on the grass at the last section of the garden which gave a beautiful image of Ooty. Most of the people were staring at us. after spending some time we came out.

We then, headed towards the Boat house. it had started raining. When we reached, we were told, that it was due to rain. We were disappointed.

So, we headed to our next destination, Government Botanical Garden. We drove a few minutes forward when my brother got confused about the roads at a four way cross. We asked a taxi driver standing there, he told it was ‘Charring cross’ and we have to take a straight road to reach Botanical Garden. So, we drove through and finally reached Botanical garden. The entrance itself was a great one. After buying tickets, we moved in. In front of us, was a huge and a striking colossal garden. We started from our left. We walked slowly inspecting each flora showcased there. we saw huge trees, topiaries of many shapes.. etc. It was enormous. There were flowering plants and many crotons arranged in many shapes. There was a 20 million old tree which has been fossilised. With all that stun we came to the entrance, where there was a huge grassland to sit. We bagged the middle of that area. it was wet but didn’t bother us. We were 6 but, were enjoying at the most. We played cricket there, then, tree to tree. We had become children. After all that cousins’ time we spend together, we moved out of the garden.

We drove to our hotel Willow hill. It was an isolated hotel. we had booked two garden room. Perfect for us. We checked in. The staff was courteous and nice. He first was stunned seeing our group. Then, we told him not to worry we were cousins. He was quite convinced that we called each ‘bhaiya’ and ‘didi’ and even the way we behaved. We moved to our respective rooms. We girls first had our relaxing hot water shower, got ready and walked to our garden. Boys were already there. then, our staff called us for lunch, when we told we would like to have our lunch at the garden so, they were so kind to shift the lunch to the garden. We took at least 1 hour to finish our lunch. Then, we spend most of the time in the garden. The most amazing part the sunrise and the place becoming dark with lights getting on. Wow.. amazing one.

The next day, we got ready early. We had planned to go towards Pykara and Mudumalai which were far then, visit the places nearby. We had our breakfast before leaving. We started at 8 towards Pykara. It was drizzling. We had readhed in around 1 hr and 15 mins (we should have taken only 50 min, because we spent time in asking the route). But, the way gave a beautiful view with mountains and lake flowing by. Anyways we had now reached the lake. we were pleased to see the lake. It was quiet and away from city’s hustle-bustle. We ran to the bank. There was a jetty with around 5-6 boats. We booked a motor boat. It was 1 hour trip with surrounds all the area. we got into the boat. Our boat driver started talking to us. He asked where we were from, how we came etc. Most of the time he talked to the boys. We all were then, got busy in taking pictures while others checked out the place. With a peaceful and calm 1 hour boating we moved to bank. We spend some time at bank playing and talking. We were happy, because we were on our own with leaving parents behind at home. We got to know more about each other. Paresh who we have known as the naughtiest one, took responsibility of all the girls and was quiet most of the time. We started understanding each other.

We moved to our next destination, Pykara falls. it has stopped raining. We could see the whole place more clearly but wet everywhere. We enjoyed the climate. We reached Pykara falls. we had to walk a while to reach the falls. there were many people walking with us. Most of people were staring at us (not again). We reached the main place. It was an awe-inspiring view. We were not allowed to go near the falls. but, the water splashed on us, which gave a chill experience. The flow was moderate contrasting to the rainy weather.

We then, moved towards Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. We drove to Theppakadu via Masinagudi which has the reception for Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. The way is fully covered with forests. The whole place was scaring. I held my sister’s hand tight. As we drove, the place started haunting us. the densely covered forest had made the place look dark even in the bright day light. Suddenly we saw some disturbance in the middle of the trees, there we saw two gaurs were standing and grazing. They stared at us and then moved inside the jungle. Then, we saw some deer, rabbits crossing the roads. We saw a rare owl type ( I don’t know which species it belonged to). then, we started spotting some other animals like; langurs, stags, wild boars, a buck and many peacocks.

After some kilometres drive we reached Theppakadu. We were told our own/private vehicles were not allowed inside the reserve so, we parked our vehicle. We then, booked with jungle safari. Before that we had our lunch. As, no food items were allowed inside the forest. Our jeep came after a 10 minutes wait. The guide who was about to come with us gave a brief self-intro, then, some instructions and guidelines. We nodded to each instruction he made. Then, our jeep moved. We first got scared and feared to move forward. But, our guide was genuine enough to take care of us. he told not to worry that he knows the behaviour of every animal there. after a few minutes’ drive, he showed us pond where a couple of elephants were drinking water. My gosh. We had never seen elephants so close in their habitat. All were silent. We took some pictures Zoom in plus Zoom out. It was just speechless. Suddenly, one of the elephants turned towards us, when stared at us. We got even more scared. I started taking long breaths. Our guide told we were at a safer distance so not to worry and not to get scared especially. After seeing elephants we moved forward and saw dead animal alongside the road. Our guide told, it might be a Tiger’s prey. Hearing that, it just moved us. we looked at each other. Our parents are gonna kill us. We then, moved forward slowly. We were in the middle of a jungle. We had already started realizing that. We saw many langurs with their little ones, peacocks, wild squirrels, pigeons, common monkeys, anteaters and shrews and bats. At last the thriller and scaring experience came to end. We were taken to the entrance.

We took our vehicle and drove back to Ooty as soon as possible, as, we didn’t want to be killed by an elephant or a tiger. It was getting darker. My cousin drove quickly out of the forest. We had now, passed the Pykara and entered to the plain land without any forest. We drove as fast as we could towards the hotel. Once we reached the hotel, the Mudumalai experience became the hot topic to talk about. The whole night (even after the dinner) we talked about that.

The next day we planned to go to Doddabetta Peak. it was 9.5 kms away (according to Google). After having our breakfast of veg sandwich, juices and tea, we started to Doddabetta. After a left turn from Charring cross, we started moving up, up and up.

After a 20 minutes drive, we reached Tea Factory and Tea museum for which we have to take a right turn up from the main road to reach. The place covered by fog, but, was awesome. We went inside after paying Rs.5 for each person. We walked inside. There was a huge room where the tea leaves were kept for filtering. After that we stepped down by a narrow way inside the factory along with us was big machines like, rollers, cutters which were doing their job with a big noise. We went through each section of the tea processing. After that we came to a place where free tea were given for tasting. We grabbed each one. It was perfect for the weather. We then moved out where we saw signs, like; Chocolate making, spices, etc. We walked to that. there we saw chocolate was kept in different aluminium bases. After that there was a chocolate outlet. We bought variety of chocolates each 250 gms. We then moved to the place where there were some shops of Nilgiri oils. We bought a small bottle of eucalyptus oil which could be used for headache, cold, body pain (in short it served as a pain killer and healer).

We then headed to Doddabetta Peak. The road was zig-zag and through a dense eucalyptus forest. The air was filled with eucalyptus’ smell. We reached Doddabetta peak after a steep up. We parked our vehicle and started climbing up by a series of steps. It was becoming hard as we graduated on. The both of the path was occupied by vendors who were selling carrots, beets, fried groundnuts, tea etc. We were tired but, once we reached the peak, the whole tiredness went away. There was fog everywhere. We walked through the fog and the mist hit us. there was a watch tower. We climbed to it. But, we couldn’t see anything because of the fog. Then, we went down and walked to the peak point. It was scary as we saw a deep valley at the end. Any mistake in taking a step would lead us to fall down. We took pictures on the rock. It was quite slippery so we had to be more careful. After spending some time we came back.

We drove straight to our hotel, where we had our lunch, took some rest, packed bags and checked out. We thanked all the staff for their politeness and patience with us. they were very helpful.

We headed to Ooty Railway station. Our train Ooty to Coonoor (56140/56141) was scheduled at 6.00 pm. we reached at 5.30 pm. we took tickets and waited for half an hour. Two of our cousins didn’t come with us (as they had to bring our vehicle). Our train arrived on time. We were excited to board on. After we secured seats for everyone (it was a passenger), we started looking around for view. Our train started. It moved slowly. Many times I have heard about the train but this was the first time I’m in the train. For all of us, it was the first time and made a life time experience. our train stopped at some stations like; Lovedale, Ketti, Aravankadu and Wellington. Every station was beautiful on its own. The train moved through aisle of trees. Once there was forest one side and a depp valley at another side. Those experiences still make us to have goose bumps. Some places we were just startled by the deep forests covered with mist. Then, we saw sun setting down behind the beautiful mountains. One of the unforgettable moments in my life. Overall it was an amazing experience.

Our train reached Coonoor at 7 in the evening. We boarded out. Our other two cousins were already waiting there for us. so, we all moved to our hotel Bella Vista, which was just 1 km away. We reached there in 5 minutes. We all dumped bags in the rooms and rushed to the restaurant. There were two dining areas. The place was quiet and without any noise. After our dinner we ran back to our rooms to have a happy night sleep.

The next morning, we got ready for sightseeing. we first went to Dolphin’s Nose point. We drove through Chandra colony to reach Kinderland school road, which then extends to Dolphin’s Nose road. It took us 45 minutes to reach there. we parked our vehicle and walked to the point with our camera. The view from here was breath taking. We also saw Catherine falls in a distance which looked like a white thread. This place also gave a great panoramic view of range of hills.

After that we walked to Lamb’s rosk poit. It gave similar view but, also looked beautiful. the sun was shining in the middle of the mountains making the scene the most wonderful one.

We then, drove back to reached Sims Park. After buying the tickets we went in. It was another version of Botanical Garden but, with a lake in it. The park was a big one, big trees of many species. There were many flowing plants, looked beautiful. it was also in a form of terrace. So we had to climb down from left and climb up from right. At the right side, there was a tree of ‘Rudhraksha’. This is the first time I’m seeing a Rudhraksha tree. Many plants were arranged with a small border of many shapes, especially India and World map. After roaming around the park, we came out.

We then, discussed about the next destinations and agreed upon going to Hulikal where we decided to meet the locals. We then drove to the main city area, where we had our lunch at Saravana Bhavan. Then, drove to Hulikal. After some distance we parked our vehicle at a house and then, walked down into the tea estate. we taking some photos, when women arrived there. they asked us something in Tamil, but we didn’t understand. Then, we told we wanted to pluck the leaves. They laughed and nodded. We started plucking leaves when, they also joined us. they talked with us in a broken English. they said, they usually do this in early mornings. They came there by seeing us. then, we collected the leaves in a basket they were carrying. It was fun plucking the leaves.

After that we moved to our hotel, had dinner and went for sleep.



The next morning we had to check out. So, we came out of the hotel, thanking each staff. Then, we headed towards Coimbatore via Mettupalayam.

Top Slip
Being in a hectic city like New Delhi, I always had a wish to visit South India and know their culture better. Then, I started with the endmost states ie. Tamilnadu and Kerala. I wanted some adventure and also to get into nature. I have already made a trip to Munnar, in this regard. Now, I chose Valparai. This is another attraction in Tamilnadu for its vast tea estates. I made my plan for 5 days as usual. I googled out places near Valparai, none attracted me like Athirapally, so it was added. Now, I booked hotel rooms and cab for my journey.

So, the itinerary goes like this: 1st day land at Coimbatore , to Topslip, Stay at Topslip.

2nd day- Topslip sightseeing, overnight drive to Valparai (stay at Valparai)

3rd day- Valparai sightseeing, stay at Valparai

4th day- To athirapally, sightseeing, Stay at Athirapally

5th day- Athirappally to Coimbatore

My close lads Ankush and Devsingh joined me at the last moment. Our adventurous tour began. We landed at the Coimbatore Airport. at the parking our driver was waiting for us with his Qualis. He gave a grin to us and we moved. Coimbatore
Way to Valparai
is a big city, i must say. No wonder why it is a hub of industrialists and tourists. With travelled through bid lanes of Coimbatore towards Topslip. As we neared Topslip the place become cooler and cooler. We went through Sethumadai (this place still needs some development) to reach the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve Entrance. We paid for us and our camera. We drove through a deep forest. Devsingh was very much excited as it is his first tour to South India. He used to stop the car several times to take pictures which I guess made driver piss off. But, he did not tell anything. No one knew tamil or Malayalam, but I could manage some Malayalam with last visit. The driver kept telling about the place half in English and half in hindi. We enjoyed his hindi though it was not perfect. We reached Topslip after a small check post. The area was so much cool. We parked our vehicle. There were many safaris and trekking available. We chose elephant safari which was scheduled to 11.00am-2.00pm. elephant ride was first experience for all of us. So, we enjoyed a lot. After the ride we went to the eatery to
Valparai Dam
have some food as we were starving. Then we asked the officer for our accommodation. He gave a big list out of which we chose the tree hut. It was good to stay, but gets scary at night. All the evening that day we spent in uploading pics in our laptop, roaming on the main lane after 7 we were not allowed to roam around.

The next day- we booked 2 trips to the jungle, one is short trekking and other’s Eco trip van safari. For the short trekking trip, a guide leaded us. He took us to deep in jungle. We walked here and there. There was a scaring quietness in the forest. Any sound from around gave a death fearing. The guide kept saying about tigers, wild animals, wild flowers and birds. He kept telling his stories all the way. At 2 we came back from a 2 hour trekking. Having done with lunch we moved to ther other safari. We had to wait a while as it was meant for 25 people. After gathering 25 people, our van moved into Parambikulam forest. Another exciting and thrilling experience. here, our guide point out a place which was stinking, saying that last night a tiger would had killed an animal and left the waste. We became cautious. But, all we saw was some wild birds, rabbits, bats and wild boars. We came back from our trip at 5 o’clock and immediately headed towards Valparai.

We came through the narrow roads of a small village. Our driver stopped at Aliyar dam. He said it is main attraction before going to Valparai. So, we got down to see the dam. There was a huge park at the entrance, through which we climbed many steps.. oh God.. to reach the top. The view was amazing. there we saw a lake in between a range of mountains.

After clicking many pictures we moved towards Valparai. In just 1 or 2 kms, we reached a fall called Monkey falls. we realised why it is called so. Ankush stepped from the vehicle to click photos of the monkeys when a naughty one hopped towards him which made me scared. Then, we ran towards the falls. we clicked many pictures being careful of not getting our clothes wet.

Spending 1 hour there we moved to Valparai. the drive was smooth and comfortable except the hairpins bends which made our head spin. After the 40th bend we reached Valparai. it’s a beautiful green place. But, the city area is not much convincing. We headed straight towards our hotel- Green hill Hotel as it was late night already. The room was clean and good for us. We directly jumped onto the bed as we were so much tired.

The next morning we planned to go to Balaji Temple in Valparai. the place was so much quiet. By the time we reached there, we saw a pujari getting ready for the arthi. So, we joined him. After getting the Prasad we came out and sat for a while at the premise. The temple was neatly managed. Anyone would like to stay for a while to see the beauty of the temple and the surrounding nature. We wanted to visit Sholay dam and Chinna kallar waterfalls but, our driver said they both are in different directions and would take more time so to choose either one. So, we decided to go Chinnakallar waterfalls. It took us nearly an hour to reach the waterfalls. We had to park our vehicle and step down to reach the waterfalls. We were so much happy to visit this waterfall. It was an amazing view. We started jumping and screaming and got off our shirts to jump into the water. It was so cold. Our driver was looking and laughing at us. We came to the bank to change our clothes. People around us were laughing at us too as we shivered and screamed out of cold. Once we were finished changing we moved to our vehicle and headed forward. From there we came to Nirar dam. It was quite an old dam (i guess). There was less water. But the scenery from the place was great. Having spend our half an hour there we headed back to our hotel. The room boy got us hot tea, as soon as we reached, which was so much relaxing. We spent the remaining hours at hotel room only.

The next day we travelled to Athirapally. On the way we stopped at Sholayar dam. The dam was so much long. we finished our lays packet here and moved forward. We witnessed the whole nature unbounded in this way. The deep forests covered with mists. Wow. We had to pay at check post at Tamilnadu- Kerala border. Then a huge deep dark forest welcomed us. It was bit scaring but was thrilling experience. we reached Athirapally nearly afternoon. We had our lunch at a local eatery and moved to our resort- Riverok Villas. The resort was surrounded by a park of trees and plants. After checking in we went out to visit Athirapally falls, which was at a walkable distance. We took our camera and headed to falls. we heard the sound of the waterfalls from way far. It thrilled us. When we saw the falls we went mad. It was just breathtaking. What a scene it was. A huge waterfall. We stepped down to it. As we were nearing it, our heart started beating faster and faster. It looks amazing from close. The whole trip was made worth with this falls. we spent as time as possible till the keeper whistled to move out. Having saved the picture of the falls we came back and spent our night talking about the whole trip.



The next day- we packed our bags back to Coimbatore. on way we had a glimpse of Vazhachal Falls. its an another beautiful witness of nature. We stopped for a while and then moved forward. we took the same route via Valparai to reach Coimbatore (not adding the Topslip).

2nd highest peak in South India
After lounging in Pondicherry for a week or so, it was time to get on the road to explore what South India had to offer. We had planned ten day’s travel with the first five to focus on historical places of interest, with the next five being focused more on scenery and relaxation.



We fit a lot into a relatively short period of time but are happy to be settled back into some home life at my Dad and Step Mother’s house in Gujarat for a bit of normality (and clean clothes) after a couple of weeks on the road.



Here’s what we’ve learned.



Booking through a good tour company is a great way to explore unknown areas of the world.

We had previously booked most of our trips through online resources like Trip Advisor and the like. For this trip, we wanted to make sure we had someone who understand what we like (a mixture of good food, a bit of history, and a lot of peace and quiet) so met with a friend of the family (Suresh at Sovereign Travel in Pondy) who did a great job understanding what
Sunset in Kerela
we were after and then booked a ten day tour where we didn’t have to worry about anything.



Loose fitting local wear is the way to go.

Rachel has always tried to avoid the appearance of ‘going native’ after seeing folks come back from Mexico for the weekend dressed in full sombrero and poncho gear. However, in the case of traveling around India, local wear has many benefits; Firstly, it is cool (if you go for natural cotton) and keeps the wearer cool (or at least cooler than close fitting man made fiber. Secondly, you get a lot less unwanted attention and the locals tend to assume you are to be respected. Thirdly, they cost very little - per the last blog, very good quality clothes can be found for under $10. Fourthly, Rachel looks ace in a punjabi top - you will see photographic evidence of this throughout.



Lots about tea.

There is a life lesson here. While in the mountains, we had a tour of a tea museum scheduled and we weren’t excited about it and were going to skip. How much do you want to know about tea? However,
Temple in Thanjavur
we took a life lesson from my mother and step-dad (the awesomely named Barry Barry Holgate after a moment of confusion at the birth registry). They tend to agree to go see anything that’s suggested. That leads to us making fun of their trips to salt museums and such, however they lead more active, educated and fun filled life than most folks we know. It was with that spirit we agreed and had one of the more interesting times on our tour. Did you know, for example that ALL tea (white, black, green, oolong etc.) comes from the same tea plant. It is just processed differently. This begs the question why Teavana charges so much for various teas (also, the best green tea at the plantation costs under $2 - a far cry from $80+ at stores in the US.).



All ‘Toddy’ is not created equal.

To lean heavily on the gonzo journalist; it was in the backwaters of Kerela when the toddy started to take hold. Rather than the nicely flavored whisky, hot water, lemon and honey drink I’d been used to drinking for colds since childhood (thanks Mum) - toddy here is a moonshine
Carvings in Gangaikondacholapuram temple
concoction made from a coconut, left to ferment for a day in the sun. We were called by our driver one night to be told he had ‘a guy’ who made toddy and do we want some. Per the above, we said yes and were given two Aquafina bottles of a cloudy grey mixture. We then had a ‘toddy’ night on a house boat. What did we learn? You’re only ever 24 hours and a coconut away from getting tipsy.



Rachel gets celebrity treatment occasionally.

The first time it happened was in the Gangaikondacholapurum (good luck with that one) temple - there were some kids who were sheepishly throwing glances at Rachel before their teacher came over and asked whether she minded if the kids got their photo taken with her. Then they all ran over and we super happy about it. This happened twice again when random folks asked Rachel to have their photo taken. She always said yes and we got some fun friends out of it.



Christianity hit India before it arrived in Western Europe.

This may be obvious to some readers, but we found a church where the
Vineyard in the foothills of the Western Ghats
sign said it was built in 407AD. We figured it was a misleading misprint because Europeans didn’t arrive until roughly a thousand years later. However, the first church in India actually dates back to 57AD (we didn’t see it) and Jews, Muslims, Hindus & Christians have been living peacefully (with some exceptional years) in places like Kerela for over a thousand years.



October is a great time to visit India.

The high season runs from November through April here, so in October the places we visited were very quiet and we didn’t feel hassled or rushed while we toured around. The weather has started to get more manageable (cooler) and it rained most nights meaning the days were a little less muggy. Due to the out-of-season aspect of the timing, along with Suresh booking us into mainly boutique style hotels, in four of the seven hotels we stayed at we were the only guests. We both could get used to the ratio of 15 staff to take care of us.





What have we been up to?

(A lot)



We got picked up from Pondicherry by our awesome
Skink Lizard
driver for the next ten days, Jeevan. We then took a couple of hour’s drive towards the center of Southern India stopping at various temples along the way, many of which dated back a thousand years. The history of most of them is fascinating but their real draw is their ornate carvings of gods, deities and stories from folk law. Some of them stand 260 feet tall and must have been something to see if you came across them out of what was essentially jungle a thousand years ago. We had some excellent guides, Rachel’s favorite being Paneer, due to his cheesy name. Although a Brahmin, we were told by our next guide that Paneer was something of a local celebrity on the late night bar scene.



Chettinad (where we stayed the second night) was one of the highlights due to it being a small town that trains many of the best chefs in India. Their cuisine is unique to the region and some of the spices can only be found locally. I took the opportunity to do a cooking class, and we both took the opportunity to stuff our faces.



After a (missable)
Monkey!
trip to Madurai we headed to the Western Ghat mountains for a stop on an island in the middle of a lake in Thekkady. This was probably the most peaceful part of the trip. We had the place to ourselves and did nothing except eat, read and sit on our porch watching the wildlife. We saw various types of deer, warthogs, monkeys, peacocks and wild elephants. One night we were drinking our new ‘empty the pantry’ cocktail - a mix of vodka, fresh pineapple juice and a neon colored orange soda drink over ice - while sat listening to music on our porch when we looked up and saw a grizzly bear listening to the music on the other side of our wooden lattice balcony about ten feet away. We were told we were very fortunate to see a bear. We didn’t feel overly fortunate at the time and it signaled the evening was going to head indoors.

Driving to the tea plantations of Munnar was an experience in itself. You travel on a road that is only wide enough to fit a bus and it winds up 5000 ft mountains with sheer drops on one side and tea
Hotel Room for the evening
plants on the other. That on it’s own would be fine, but when you’re overtaking one of those busses and another bus comes the other way you discover that the road will actually fit three vehicles, going different directions, at speed. At times like this it is wise to focus on the tea plants.



We did a tour of Munnar with a trek to the second highest peak in South India along with the aforementioned tea museum. We were shown around by a wonderful guide called SriRaj. He knew so much about the wildlife of the area and more than any man we’ve ever met about tea. He was one of the main reasons we had such an interesting trip to Munnar. A good guide makes for a good visit. He left us with a list of Bollywood movies to watch as he was well versed in those as well.





Our trip ended with some days in the scenic backwaters of Kerela. One night was spent on a house boat which gives you a relaxing meander around the rivers and lakes. We had a great chef again so ate well while laying
Breakfast above the clouds
on cushions at the front of the boat under a traditional thatched ceiling watching river life go on around us. It made us feel a bit like Egyptian royalty headed up the Nile. After spending 24 hours on the boat, we headed to Fort Cochin, one of our favorite places so far in India. It’s a town that has been a center of the spice trade since 2000BC. The architecture is heavily influenced by the Portuguese (1500 - 1650AD), the Dutch (1650 - 1800AD) and the Brits (1800 - 1950AD), and still has wide open spaces, Chinese fishing nets, a palace, and a synagogue dating back to the 1500’s. However, we had been on the road for quite some time so we were excited to leave Kerela (although we will genuinely miss our driver, Jeevan) to catch a plane up to Gujarat and the comfort of my parent’s beautiful home, and their washing machine.

Getting there
The Journey from home


View from our cottage
The flight… Long but uneventful. We watched Spy (decent), Hoff My Chest (a BBC mock-umentary staring David Hasselhoff playing David Hasselhoff in an attempt to revive his career in England) and fell asleep to Mad Max. Obviously things have got civilized again in the world (?) as it was the first flight in years where we had a proper knife and fork instead of their useless plastic cousins.



Arrived at 3:30am to a busy Chennai international airport. After such a long flight we were thankful that it only took about half an hour to collect bags, get through customs and immigration. My niece / wonder-friend, Dhvani had kindly organized a car to pick us up and we were thankful for that as it looked a little random if we were to get a taxi provided by one of the dozen or so folks offering us that service as we were leaving the airport.



After leaving the airport we had an hour’s drive to leave Chennai and head south to our first stop, Fisherman;s cove near Mahabalipuram. The drive was a calm affair (a first for me in India) maybe due to the time of morning,
Sunrise
6am at Fisherman's Cove
but it seemed like everyone was staying to the correct side of the road. There were the usual sleeping cows, but Ganesh (our driver) avoided them with a practiced confidence.



Chennai itself looked like a city in the midst of modernization. In amongst the older shops and two story restaurants there was a lot of shiny new office blocks that wouldn’t have looked out of place anywhere in the world. We plan on making a trip back to Chennai soon to spend some time with Dhvani soon so I’ll take some photos then.



Fisherman’s Cove (or Vivanti as it is now called) was planned to be a relaxing first stop so we could get over any jet lag and get acclimated to our new time zone (11.5 hours ahead of Atlanta). It was odd to think that although it was early Tuesday morning where we were, Monday night football hadn’t kicked off yet back home.



We knew that this first stop is not representative of the rest of India. The beaches are raked every morning and the gardens are pruned. Most of India doesn’t have a swim up bar.

Breakfast
So glad to see English Bacon back on my menu


However, we’d been to this hotel when I was a kid so I was looking forward to returning.



We weren’t sleepy so took the opportunity to watch the sunrise over the Bay of Bengal and after walk on the beach went for breakfast. Hello bacon my old friend. Breakfast was really tasty and included english (hurray) bacon and a buffet of various made to order Idli’s (Indian crispy pancakes stuffed with potatoes and served with a chimi-churi type ‘samba’) and other wonderful things.



In keeping with our relaxing ideas of the next couple of days, we then deposited ourselves at the spa. Rachel got a massage for the next hour and I got a haircut and a shave, then settled into a 90 minute facial. I’ve brought a photo of Olivier Giroud with me so I can show hair dressers an approximation of what to do. It’ll be interesting to see how they turn out when i make the transition from hotel spa barber, to side of the road barber. I also suggested to the barber to do ‘whatever he thinks makes the most sense’ with my facial hair so I currently look
Yum
a bit like my evil twin.



Due to the jet lag and the extreme relaxation during the spa, most of the facial was spent falling in and out of snoozes.



Lunch was eaten at the pool and consisted of chili dusted fish and ice cold beer. It’s nice to arrive on a Tuesday as we pretty much have the hotel to ourselves. There was one other person at the pool.



We then went back to the room for a quick lie down and woke 5 hours later in time for dinner.

The day was shaping up perfectly.



Due to the ‘fisherman’s’ aspect of the hotel, we decided to stick to seafood as much as possible and had south Indian spiced Tiger Prawns and some grilled calamari which were both good and tasty. Rachel also enjoyed some Pineapple martinis while I had a couple of basil / rum / something blue drinks.





All in all, a fun / tasty / relaxing kick-off to our adventure. Our next update will be from Pondicherry in a couple of days.

It was 2011, we took a 3 day weekend trip to Ooty to celebrate our second anniversary. Saswata was living in IISc after a year of long distance relationship and we were both very happy. We have always wanted to travel. He has been travelling to many places since childhood, whereas I was mostly been around West Bengal when I was kid. One of our major connection was the shared love of travel. With this trip our travel life would start, I would get a life long travel partner and I would finally get to see the places that I have always imagined in my dreams. The majestic mountains, the waterfalls, the oceans, the forests and someday maybe even we will see other countries!

Now I am writing this blog four and half years later. So much have changed, now we both live in USA, in a few hours distance and we have seen a lot of places till date. So many more to go! I am going to update this blog every few weeks, first I will have to catch up with our all past travels.

This is the first trip we ever took together.

Me
Nilgiri Hills view
Dear All

Greetings from the Nilgiri Hills! “Nilgiri” means “Blue Mountain”, and is an upland area in the north-west corner of Tamil Nadu state. It is home to a number of ex-colonial British-founded hill stations, where the Brits of colonial Madras used to come to escape the heat of the Indian summer and spend time in the beautiful forested mountains and tea plantations. My trip here has taken a very different turn from Kerala, and feels quite unusual and off-the-beaten track to be honest. I am currently in a town called Ooty, the main tourist destination of the Nilgiri Hills, yet I am very much off the foreign tourist trail. Many Indian families seem to come here for holidays, presumably also away from the heat of the plains (it is deliciously cool up here, no need for air-conditioning!), but I have not seen another traveller since leaving Kerala two days ago. It is very different, very unusual, but very enjoyable in an adventurous sort of way, particularly the place where I am staying at the moment, which I will relate further below.

So, I believe I last wrote from Alleppey, exploring the Keralan backwaters and observing the warm-ups for

the Nehru Trophy Boat Race, which is in actual fact taking place today. After a wonderful two days at the Sona Heritage Home, continuing to be the only guest there in the faded grandeur of a place, the owner gave me a lift on the back of his motorbike, my two backpacks in tow, to the town’s bus station. Amazingly I met up with a French couple who I met way back in Madurai, who were waiting for the same AC bus as me to take us northwards to the beautiful ex-colonial Portuguese/Dutch/British town of Fort Cochin, or Kochi as it is known today.

And what a beautiful little place it was, and if I am to compare it with Pondicherry, which I probably shouldn’t do, felt much more relaxed, with a great traveller-vibe but still not being overwhelmed by tourism. True, the rickshaw drivers were a little more insistent than usual, and are known to whisk tourists away unwittingly to numerous Kashmiri-owned souvenir shops rather than to the place that they requested. But I thoroughly enjoyed my two days there, the first involving a blissful walk around town through its colonial heritage backstreets, and some fantastic little places

to fill up with food and drink. Indeed, one little tea house called the “Tea Pot” really stood out for me here, being completely decked out with tea-related ornaments, decorations and furniture fittings: tables were placed on tea-crates, teapots occupied every ornamental space, and paintings depicted old, Indian adverts for tea. A truly tea-oriented place, which also rustled up a mean curry!

My second day I had planned to do more sightseeing, but upon setting foot in my fantastic, wonderful, delightful home stay there, I felt completely called to have a down-time day there, nothing else. It was wonderful. The place was called the Delight Home Stay, a home stay being a few rooms added on to a family home, where you’re often made to feel like part of the family. I took the prime room, with a wonderful balcony and view over some playing fields and one of the most beautiful trees I have ever seen. It also looked out onto the home’s immaculate garden, with the finest lawn I have seen in a long time, even nicer than many I have seen back home. Tied in with being a stone’s throw from the winner of Asia’s top

boutique hotel award for 2014, the Malabar House, this was just bliss, and Thursday was spent truly winding down, eating well at the Malabar’s fine restaurant, enjoying a spot of tea at the Tea Pot, and chilling out on the beautiful balcony with the amazing view. Honestly, travelling really doesn’t get better than this!

Or does it...?

In fact, the last two days have been just wonderful also, in a different way. Friday morning I caught a train from a place called Ernakulam, the large modern city attached to beautiful Kochi. Though I almost in fact missed it. The ironic thing is that for a touristy town where you can’t cross a street without a rickshaw driver asking if you want to go anywhere, there were absolutely none around at 8am in the morning when I needed one to take me the half-hour journey to the train station to get my train. The home stay owner, the fantastic David, said this was because all the souvenir shops were not open yet, and I believe he wasn’t far from the truth. It took us 15 minutes to find one, and when it came, we got stuck in the almightiest
Nehru Trophy Boat Race Boat
Alleppey
of Indian traffic jams as everyone and their neighbour seemed to want to cross the two bridges linking Kochi with Ernakulam, unsurprisingly due to it being the early morning rush hour. This was stressful. I did arrive at the station 15 minutes in time for my train, but being a person who likes to get to transport places at least an hour early just in case, and faced with the alternative of having to take a government bus, probably non-AC, for 4.5 hours instead, this was a major relief, and I really settled into the journey and enjoyed it.

The train took me inland, away from the Keralan coast, and through a mountain pass in the Western Ghat mountain range back into Tamil Nadu. The mountain pass was just stunning – the train stayed on the flats between the mountains on either side, but passing through these huge, boulder-type outcrops of mountains covered in forest was mightily impressive. The train took me to Coimbatore, a large and seemingly quite prosperous industrial town in the north-west of Tamil Nadu, home to around one million. They call it “The Manchester of India” for its textile industry, and I thought “yeah, right,
Chinese Fishing Nets
Kochi (Fort Cochin)
I’ll believe that when I see it”. But in fact, if Manchester is considered to be a large, prosperous city away from the central capital region of a country, then the title does not seem too far off the mark.

Most hotels in Coimbatore looked a dive, though, to be honest, and I was fortunate to check into the fantastic Hotel ESS Grande, in a beautiful business-class suite with an extremely enticing view over the city and towards the Nilgiri mountain range in the distance. Indeed, watching the sun set over the mountains with a Kingfisher beer in hand, thinking that that’s where I’ll be headed the next day, was a wonderful way to spend the evening. Although Coimbatore has few tourist sights, and nothing whatsoever listed in the Lonely Planet except for a few hotels, restaurants and a map, I actually really enjoyed my time there. Definitely off the beaten tourist track, I did a bit of Internet research and found a modern shopping mall nearby. The afternoon was spent endulging in the pleasures of Western delights, and I plied myself with Kentucky Fried Chicken, Subway cookies, a delicious iced brownie drink, chocolate and yoghurt. I have in
Kochi Street Scene
fact adored the Indian food I have had since arriving here, the cuisine is just so tantalisingly tasty, but I still revelled in this afternoon of Westernised reminiscence. Never had a chicken wing tasted so good…!!

So my plan was to arrive in Coimbatore, and hopefully somehow book a ticket on the famous, UNESCO World Heritage status “Toy Train”, which climbs and negotiates the steep mountain journey from nearby Mettupalayam to Ooty, tourist centrale of the Nilgiri Hills. However, Coimbatore’s train station wasn’t too helpful, and I didn’t fancy joining the mile-long queue for ticket reservations (well, maybe not a mile, but it was long and hardly moving…) only to find out that you don’t book the tickets there. In fact, I believe you are only able to book the tickets at Mettupalayam itself, else perhaps on the Internet or through Tourist Agencies. There were seemingly none of the latter around town, and I don’t really trust Internet purchasing while I’m over here. Finally, my hotel receptionist told me that they only decide whether to run the train on the morning of departure, departure time being 7.10am from Mettupalayam, an hour’s drive from Coimbatore, due to many trees, branches
Kochi Street Scene
and rocks falling on the railway line each day. Anyway, to cut a long story short, it just seemed rather a lot of hassle to book a ticket on this amazing way to get to Ooty, despite the fact that a TV documentary on it I saw around a year ago was the very inspiration for me taking this trip to India in the first place. I also didn’t fancy taking a government bus up there, the Lonely Planet says the four-hour journey is often very crowded and actually recommends taking a taxi up there. So that is what I did, and parting with around £19 enabled me to travel up the mountain this morning in style!

The journey up was amazing! After around an hour or so of plain road driving, the road started to go up, and then followed hairpin after hairpin bends, through thickly forested mountain slopes, over bridges crossing mountain streams and waterfalls, and past families of mischievous-looking monkeys. What was just wonderful were the constant, often quite amusing, signs encouraging safe driving and environmental protection on the way up. This is something I remember from travelling up to Darjeeling, another hill station in
Kochi Street Scene
the North of India on my last visit to the country, with “Hurry burry spoils the curry” still sticking in my mind ten years later. The classics this time were “Accidents bring tears, safety brings cheer”, “Clean Ooty, green beauty”, “Find a bin, put it in”, the rather direct “Hospital ceilings are boring…avoid accidents”, and the somewhat enigmatic “Stop and ponder. Posterity should thank you not curse you”. A memorable trip up to the hill station indeed, with many wise words to ponder on the way up!

On the way I did pass the Railway Workers’ Village Compound, which featured in the TV documentary a year ago, which despite not taking the toy train, was memorable enough for me. But the driver was rather irksome to say the least. I believe I can tell more or less which ones are going to be the bother: the ones who want to point everything out to you and ask whether you want to stop and take a photo, or stop for a chai, or stop to have something to eat, they seem to believe they are providing something more than just a taxi service, some kind of alternative but rubbish sightseeing
Kochi Street Scene
tour for tourists. I had no doubt that he would hint for more than 1900 rupees (£19) upon arrival, which he did rather pitifully by saying he was hungry and needed to eat. What the…?! No! This really annoys me, that on top of charging much more for foreigners like myself than locals, some people believe that they are owed something in addition. It is not the first time I have encountered this kind of thinking, having seen it many times in certain African countries in particular, and it is unfortunately the negative and unwitting consequence of the benignly-intentioned system of international aid. That Westerners abroad can often be seen as walking money cows, there to just donate to the locals. Indeed, I could tell things may be heading in this direction as the driver also asked me on the way up if there are any “trusts” in my country which may help him to provide his children with an education (?!). I believe it is also why the hotel porter in Kanyakumari took an instant disliking to me, as although I did give him a tip for a meal he brought up to me, he didn’t seem to like
Kochi Street Scene
asking for it (by pointing to his mouth and then to his stomach…?!). No, not nice, and this doesn’t leave a good taste in my mouth to be honest. I would not want to tip either, as I would not want to set a precedent for future tourists.

Anyway, I did arrive at least, in my current place of residence for two nights. And what an unusual but seriously stunning place this is. It is called the Mount View Heritage Home, and is housed in an old British bungalow home overlooking the main valley and town of Ooty. It is seriously stunning for the absolutely enormous room I have here, covered in wall-to-wall hard wood, including all of the walls, the fireplace, the beautiful bed, and the three-piece suite. There appears to be just one other couple staying here, but it is still quite spookily quiet. Unusual in that the owner, who I spoke with on the phone a number of times to make my reservation and ask for directions, is not on-site, and the place is seemingly run by a number of people who don’t really seem to know what they’re doing. When I arrived and said I
Kochi Street Scene
had a reservation, they just looked at me rather perplexed until I suggested that they perhaps show me to a room. They then agreed that this would be a good idea, and here I am. The service may not be spectacular, if there is any service at all, but blimey what a find!! I include some photos here of my room to hopefully illustrate what I mean – amazing indeed!

Finally, and this is just perfection indeed, this wonderfully faded grandeur of a place is right next door to a modern resort hotel, complete with tourist desk and a wonderful restaurant – perfection again! I enjoyed a delicious curry lunch there, followed by a wonderful two-hour hike with the hotel trekking guide and a teenager from Dubai staying at the hotel with his family, up a nearby viewpoint. The trek involved a steep hike, past a temple dedicated to the monkey-god Hanuman, perhaps halfway up the mountain due to the importance of mountains given to Hanuman. In the Hindu epic, the Ramayana, when Hanuman, half-monkey half-man, was asked by the avatar-god Rama (a human incarnation of the Hindu god Vishnu), to whom he is completely devoted, to fetch a
Kochi Street Scene
School's out...
rare mountain plant from the Himalayas in order to prepare a medicine to cure a wounded comrade, Hanuman wasn’t sure which one to get whilst up there, so instead was said to have brought back the whole mountain! Indeed, Hanuman statues are often shown with him holding a mountain in one of his hands. Perhaps this is why the Hanuman Temple was there…? Anyway, not sure, but past the temple we climbed on up, through forests which the guide said were walked by bears and leopards at night (!!), to a viewpoint affording spectacular views across the tea plantations and Nilgiri Hills to the south and west. Stunning, and well worth it. Photos attached here.

So, this brings me to the present moment, writing this one from my stunning and enormous room in this Heritage Home, to hopefully upload onto my blog shortly at the reception, which has Wifi connection but doesn’t seem to be too strong – hopefully it’ll make it along with the photos…

I will sign off here for now. My journey has indeed taken a different turn as I have left the Keralan coast and somewhat exited the beaten tourist track. I believe these
Kochi Street Scene
next few days will open up a bit more of the natural side of India to me, as I spend two nights first here in Ooty, and then a further two nights at a safari lodge in the nearby Mudumalai Tiger Reserve – one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots apparently, and having one of the best chances in India of seeing a tiger in the wild. Looking forward very much!

I should also say for now that I may not be too connected to the Internet over the next few days, until Wednesday at least. Along with the not-so-great connection here in my lodge in Ooty, apparently my lodge in Mudumalai does have Wifi, but they say it is rather intermittent…

So until the next time, most likely from either Mysore or Bangalore, my final two destinations after Mudumalai, thanks for reading, all the best, and bye for now!

Right Gear 350-Yelagiri Trip 2015


A short breakfast past Tambaram
It was a trip which was planned months ago, a trip that always seemed to be a mystery as it was still lying unexplored due to various reasons. Route, maps, excel sheets, important landmarks, turns and twists on the roads, towns and villages earmarked only pumped up our excitement, overridden by commitments, unplanned events, unexpected constraints, uncooperative factors, unconfirmed team, doubts about our ability to travel so far and the list goes on……. The second week of July 2015 saw an altogether different scene with the one and only ‘right gear’ royal enfield bullet classic 350 in the team all set to start. It was just a group of 5 people with 2 royal enfield classic 350 bullets and a Honda activa which seemed to be the final team with which we had to start this trip that we had planned for July, 11, 2015.

07.00 p.m. July 10. The evening developed signs of moody dreariness following a heavy downpour that lasted all through the evening and night, making us hesitant about the trip and to the time of departure from our originating points. I was supposed to start from Chennai at 06.00 hours while Jayaraj and Anand along with
Re checking the route map at Walajabad
Jagadish were scheduled to leave from Kalpakkam at 07.00 hours. But the time delay was way beyond since it rained through the night but finally I kick-started my journey at 09.00 hours, informing Jayaraj, Anand and jagadish who swiftly departed at 09.30 hours from Kalpakkam.

A journey of unexpected and magical moments lay in await for us proceeding on our second trip, united together this time, as members of the club ‘Right Gear 350’. I proposed to ride through Tambaram, Mudichur to meet Jay, Anand and Jag at Walajabad at an earlier scheduled time of 08.00 hours but that would not be possible any more since the departure from Chennai was delayed by more than 3 hours and 15 minutes. Jay and Jag, along with Anand were on a parallel ride from Kalpakkam now, through Chengalapattu to meet us at Walajabad, equally delayed by 3 hours.

I stopped for a short breakfast break well past Tambaram at Manivakkam along with Wesley who was my pillion rider. After the break, I rode along to the Mudichur road end and joined the Vandalur – Walajabad State Highway which took me on a steady throb to Walajabad in 45 minutes, delayed

even further, but just as we had planned. I finally sighted Jayaraj, Jagadish and Anand waiting near the government school at Walajabad, in the usual red T-shirts and blue jeans which eventually became the official attire of the club. Meetings, introductions, route rediscussions took up some more of our time pushing us well beyond our planned schedule.

11.45 hours and the team decided to pull ahead out of Walajabad. Jay, Anand and Jag took a lead ahead of us since I wanted to buy some water bottles and in a short time we reached the suburbs of Kanchipuram, the historical town. We were supposed to take the Military Road on the left after crossing the Pachaiyappa’s college but I was a bit skeptical as there was a left turn near a petrol pump and I could not find Jay or Jag anywhere around. Calling them on their mobiles proved to be in vain because it was evident they were riding fast to hear the mobile ringing. I slowly took the left turn not knowing if I had crossed pachaiyappa’s college and proceeded a little further for a few kilometers and then decided to turn back to the same junction
Refreshed after the lunch break at Vandavasi
hoping that the other members would be around. A subsequent call from Anand made me realize that the other members had taken the same turn on the left and were well ahead of us, too far to turn back to the same junction. I checked with a passerby to make sure if I had crossed pachaiyappa’s college and that was confirmed. I was on the right track.

My watch showed me 12.45. We had to take the same road to Vandavasi which was our agreed next destination.

We stopped only once in between, the road being quite smooth, with very less traffic, the afternoon heat very much bearable due to overnight rains. My bull was just fresh after engine refitting and so I was not straining her engine much, doing only 40 or so but as the time wore on I decided it was going to be too late, already well behind schedule. I throttled the bull to 50 plus kmph and we were on a sturdy ceaseless trip except for bad roads in between.

2.20 pm and I was pulling up next to Jay, Anand and Jag at Vandavasi town, Kanchipuram district. Our stomachs needed their
Midpoint between Vandavasi and Polur, Tiruvannamalai District
fuel so the hunt was on for a good eating joint and finally we barged into the Jain mess for a decent vegetarian meal, followed by selfies and some light moments, which delayed us further, that which never bothered us much as we were all together again.

Refreshed after nearly 5 hours of journey, which, was too slow for a road trip, a result of the miscalculation by me of the average speed, we geared up to go ahead and got underway, the riders and the pillion passengers changing bikes and riding positions, replenishing our water requirements. It was 04.00 pm by the time we got out of Vandavasi town on to the state highway heading towards Polur the next town.

Lush green fields greeted us on either sides, as we rode our bikes, reaching speeds up to 60 kmph plus on the state highway, keeping together on the move. The spirit of riding was catching up and we rode progressively together and no sooner we had got into a formation of riding, the dark clouds surrounding us opened up, the cold droplets of rain making us feel quite chill all of a sudden. Though the short showers
Parked at a tea shop at Polur
were a welcome relief still we slowed down since the roads became wet. The whiff of the damp fields enveloped us, in spite the sudden rains having stopped, which was even more exciting and it fabricated a sense of rural experience with fields, remote hills, petite villages, cattle grazing lazily and the simple, meagerly populated hamlets which gave no importance to time, a complete transformation from the hustle of the city to the quietness of rural Tamilnadu . The green fields were a constant attraction and so we decided to stall further and take some photo shoots of the greenery around us.

Pulling on further on the vacant stretch of roads, with a few buses oncoming, we maintained uniform speeds managing to be above 60 kmph. Not even Jagadish on his Honda activa was giving up and managed to uphold along with our bulls. The sun showed signs of setting high in the sky much to our amazement and at random we focused at the setting sun, high up in the horizon, which indeed was a rare phenomenon but to our surprise and joy, we discovered that the sun was actually setting behind the hills which was none other

than the long range of Javadhu hills of the Tiruvannamalai district which came into view as we approached Polur. Our first view of the hills which set the excitement unbound, and we knew the fantastic part of the journey was almost yet to begin. The Hills came closer as we rode on, guiding us into the quaint little town of Polur, very much at the foothills of the javadhu hills.

It was decided that we would stop for a cup of tea and some water replenishment before we start. The onlookers at the local tea stall had curious looks at our bikes and the common red t–shirts that we had adorned for the journey. The tea was served in tall glasses which was a great welcome after a long journey. It was at that time that I noticed a small mini bus making its way from the other side of the tea shop, the size of it was very obvious that such buses were used only in the hills. I noticed the board with the name ‘Athimoor’ on the bus and I referred to the map that we had carried and my eyes captured the location which I presumed
The setting sun past Athimoor
would be a part of our route at the foothills.

Excitement was building up. Bikes roared to life again and we took the road just behind the tea shop, a rather rickety and bumpy path with shops and houses on either side. Slowly the traffic and the habitation of the town became scanty and we proceeded on to well laid roads ruled by even greener groundnut fields. The sun was just beginning to set down as we made our last stop at the foothills for a mandatory check just past Athimoor. The scene was just out of the movie so much that Wesley had his own share of excitement and took off with Jag’s bike on his own for a short ride much to all our surprise. We began our journey once more and the hills loomed up very close to our vicinity. We stopped for short photo shoot and then it was Anand riding solo on Jai’s bull, with Jai and Jag on the Honda activa, followed by me and Wesley on my bull.

The road became more deserted with thick trees on the sides, an occasional biker giving us company head on. The sun had vanished
Mandatory check of the bikes before approaching the ghats
just behind the tall hills, but still ample daylight was around and we saw the first sight of the road climbing up into the hill. Polur town was far behind now, not a sign of it anywhere to our eyes. The only sound was the thump of our bullets as we rode with great excitement up the hills. Curves, Bends, Hairpin bends, bumps, ups and downs….we enjoyed every second of this hill ride. Horns blaring and engine screaming as our bikes turned, slanted and roared up the beautiful Javadhu hills. Each of us were gripped in our own world of whimsical fantasies, riding for the first ever time in our lives up the hills. Finally we stopped at a small hairpin bend at 2200 feet above mean sea level to get an awesome peek of the town of Tiruvannamalai from the hills.

The temperature had dropped suddenly, the cool mountain air surrounding us with drops of rain patting on our helmets sporadically. Everything was became quiet with the sun setting down, even the noise of the birds had fainted away and we could only hear our deep breaths as the 5 of us stood mesmerized amidst the javadhu hills,
Cruising near Jamunamarathur @ 2200 feet
staring in to the distant valley below. It was time for a change of positions. Wesley got on to Jai’s bull with Jai riding, Jag was solo on his active and Anand hopped on to my bull along with me. The other two vehicles took a short lead ahead of us, and I decided to have selfie with Anand since the scene around was so enthralling. We started at the earliest not to lose the other members and up we rode high into the javadhu hills. The roads became dark and my headlamp had to be switched on and my horn never ceased to blare at the slightest bend on the up hill road. All of a sudden we seemed to be alone in the hills as there was no sign of Jay and Jag ahead of us. Fascination increased more with the daylight totally diminishing and the hills put on a strange and mystical appearance in the high beam of my headlamp. Deep in my heart I thanked my friend Michael for putting me on to the electrical professional Mr. Ramu who redid the electrical wiring of my bullet and refitted the headlamps which did great wonders on the
Anand, standing tall on the wall overlooking the valley
ride up the dark hills, giving me a clear vision of the road ahead. At one right turn, we met Jai and Jag, waiting there with Wesley and our team was on the move together again.

The temperature further dropped as we ascended the ghat section and the thrill was evident amongst us, riding all alone in the dark after sunset, each moment filled with anticipation and we did not know what lay ahead of us. The road straightened out into a flat terrain, which we assumed to be the closest point to the summit and went on without any further elevation. Within minutes we could see the lights of an approaching town. The mystery town on my mind, unheard of and strangely named, which innumerable times had been discussed in our plans and the only town on this part of the Javadhu hills, Jamunamarathur, was a welcome sight where we braked to a halt at 08.00 pm. With a small bus stand and plenty of shops and a convent to its credit, the chilly town of Jamunamarathur was a much bigger than we expected it to be.

Time for change of positions for us riders though I
Selfie with Anand
had no choice but to ride my bull by myself. Jai hopped on to my bike and Anand was in charge of Jai’s bull with Wesley riding pillion behind him and Jagadish following solo in between us. The exhilaration continued further as we approached kavalur, our eyes scanning to see the Vaina Bappu Observatory but the hill road started to descend rapidly and with our concentration on the downhill ride, we missed the observatory completely, much to our disappointment. Again the darkness of the hills seemed to cloak us on the descent down the hills. Our hands were becoming numb with the journey getting into its 11th hour but the excitement never left us for a moment and we continued to cruise down the hills into Alangayam in search of food. Good food being a doubtful opinion, we were guided by locals to eat at Vaniyambadi which was to be our next pit stop. Familiar habitation came into view as we crossed the railway crossing at vaniyambadi and parked our bikes in front of the thalapakattu biriyani hotel at Vaniyambadi.

So it was at Vaniyambadi that we made one more refueling of our petrol tanks and some tasty fuel
Dinner time at Vaniyambadi
for our stomach which we carried and now the factor to be decided was whether it was safe to go up the hills to Yelagiri or check into a room at Vaniyambadi. Discussions went on and I called my good friend Mr. Elangovan who was well versed with the area and he confirmed that it was totally safe to ride up the yelagiri hills any time of the day or night. So it was settled that we would ride up the hills once more.

10.45 pm. Saturday, July 11, 2015. The bikes roared to life once again and we were on the state highway from Vaniyambadi to the Tirupattur - Salem road. Just beyond Mandalavadi we took the left turn to the Yelagiri road. I was on my bull with Wesley, Jai and Anand in his bull with Jagadish tagging in between. In no time we ascended the Yelagiri Ghat section and the real fun began after we started to maneuver the first of the 14 hairpin bends. After the 6th bend we stopped as the sparkle of lights of the town of Ambur and Jolarpettai below, twinkled like stars strewn from the sky. It was a mesmerizing view,
Midpoint on the Yelagiri Hills
not which many would have even experienced at that time of the night. We stood in complete silence, in the dark of the night, our bikes switched off in dead silence, staring in awe below at the sparkling lights of the towns below. Moments passed in fascination, each in our own thoughts devouring the sight that lay in front of us. Unbelievable is what we could say. Beauty they say, lies in the eyes of the beholder and the beauty as it was in our eyes the beautiful towns and villages viewed from the mountain above had no expression to be defined.

Never did we imagine that a late miscalculated time in the trip would lead us to such a beautiful spectacle but we could not wait any longer, the night becoming chill, with steady cold wind blowing out on our faces.

11.25 pm. We started our bikes again. Every hairpin bend was an achievement though our tired bikes made no clutter of the hills bends and willfully treaded up the hills. The sound of gears shifting, the 3.5 horsepower engines of our bulls, whining in altered sounds with the gear change, up the hills, at that time
Tired but overjoyed - midpoint at the Yelagiri Hills
of the night was music to our ears. Without any other sound to interrupt, I felt that this was the first time in life I had ever heard the complete sound of the engine of royal Enfield bullet. Every turn was different, the towns below striking a different pose in each hairpin bend and finally we moved away from the edge of the mountain and the road started to wind inwards into the mountain.

The last bend accomplished, the road straightening out, the sudden chill of the mountain caught us off guard and as the lights of the town of Yelagiri showed up in the distance, I lifted my left hand, let go of the clutch lever, signaling the thumbs up to let the riders behind me know that we made it! Yelagiri Ride 2015 as we called it was a dream come true at 11.45 pm, Saturday night came to close and we soared into Yelagiri, filled with delight on our accomplished expedition, riding straight into the Aruvi hotel where we parked our bikes for the night. The formalities finished, we checked out our new room and then made straight for the campfire to relax and have the

meal which we dedicatedly brought up all the way up the hills!

July 12, 2015, Sunday, woke us up much refreshed from the previous day journey, lazing around the hotel, we met a few people who were scrutinizing our bullets, trying to find out more about our trip from Chennai. We had a short conversation with them and had just enough time to get ready for our trip back to Chennai. Mr. Ravi the manager of Hotel Aruvi was another ardent bullet lover who owned a 500cc classic and together we had a photo shoot with all the bulls line up from 350 cc to 500 cc and from the latest model to the vintage ones. 1.30 pm, yet another delay in our preparation to leave back but we managed to leave hotel Aruvi, bidding farewell to Mr. Ravi and down the mountains we rode back to the hairpin bends. We stopped at one particular hairpin bend for a photo shoot and so sooner a tiny monkey, hopped on to Jay’s bull, made off with the water bottle as though it was his own. We helplessly watched after it took its huge share of gulps and threw the bottle
Riding down the Yelagiri Hills
off and hopped away. We descended back down to the foothills, leaving Yelagiri behind and stopped for a brief halt at the Vaniyambadi – Salem Highway junction. Jagadish wanted to reach back home soon and hence there was a discussion held at mandhalavadi to route we wanted to take.

Alangayam, it was decided and so we took the narrow roads which winded up and down towards Aalangayam, passing right under the foothills of the yelagiri hills, through insignificant villages, mostly inhabited by farmers and their folk, passing a peaceful Sunday, giving us casual stares as the noise of our bullets would have surely woken up anyone in his afternoon nap! Beautiful fields, small bus stops where buses never came or went, tiled houses lined up this part of the road of vellore district. Finally after a roller coaster ride we reached back to Alangayam where we were forced to stop for our lunch. Jagadish was still worried about reaching back home late so he firmly decided to make a short rip on his own to Chennai through the national highway. Indeed it was a disappointment for us and we had no option but to part ways, Jagadish taking the

short road to Vellore while we took the same road back up the other side of the javadhu hills to Jamunamarathur.

Cruising through the hills once again I made sure I did not miss the observatory this time with daylight to guide us. Yes there it was as we rounded the curve towards kavalur, the high dome of the Vaina Bappu Observatory could not be missed and we promptly parked our bikes next to the observatory gate. It was the only observatory between south Africa and Australia to give a clear view of the celestial sky above, built in unique positions and recognised by the departments of astrophysics from around the world, a location discovered amidst the Javadhu hills by Dr. M. K. Vaina Bappu another renowned scientist. Unidentified and completely secluded the observatory lay quietly in the hills, unavailable to easy eyes, but the establishment behind the discovery of so many celestial wonders which man had not known so far. Jay tried to convince the security introducing himself as a scientist from the Kalpakkam Atomic power plant, but the rules here not meant to be broken and we are told to come back only on a Saturday night
The amazing Amirthi Forest
between 7 and 9 pm! The observatory which we had seen so many times on our computer screens, which had inculcated various images into our minds, was never going to be a reality visit on this trip. We had to be contended with just a secret photo shot of the entrance to the observatory and start our bikes once more.

The spirits which dampened rejuvenated once again as we cruised through Jamunamarathur, not stopping this time anywhere and took the left turn before the bus terminus towards the Amirthi forest. The road beyond was much beautiful, the houses were neatly built with bamboo fences and hay thatched roofs, lively live stock loitering on the roads and villagers in their simple attire, feeling at ease attending to their neighborhood chores. It was hard to point out if was a weekday or a Sunday. As we rode further, the woods thickened. The road started to wind about with very turn, with unexpected elevations. It was a strange sensation to be in this part of the Javadhu hills, the evening closing in faster than we imagined. The route became more desolate and not a vehicle or habitation was to be seen. This
The only concret bit of road in the Amirthi Forest
was like a fairy tale paradise and we felt like being in no man’s land, never presuming as to which district of the Javadhu hills we were riding and the path we had taken was leading to nowhere. All around there were only ranges and ranges of distant hills above us covered with thick vegetation. We had no place to stop even for a cup of tea, riding on like we were lost. Not a soul, not an animal in sight and it felt like an invisible road had been laid, without knowing where it was leading to, just for us to drive by. That was what we could express at that point of time. Photos that we shot were not enough to describe the route we traveled that day. When we decided to stop, we stopped in the middle of nowhere once again but there was a small bit of human presence around. We stopped right on a short concrete stretch of road which was specifically laid to retain the road connectivity as there were signs of flash floods and water which had flown through the same spot where we stood. The setting sun was another threat and we
The lone bamboo tree serving as a backdrop forJayaraj
noticed the birds flying back to their nests and dark clouds rising up behind the distant hills. There was no more time to waste and we had to leave the forest before it was too dark and Amirthi was way too long from our halt.

We were back on our bikes, but riding fast was never possible as the road was too treacherous with sudden twists and low hung trees with thick branches. I never could perceive how this part of Tamilnadu was not ever discovered by the world out there, so much so that these routes still remained hot favorites for the local inhabitants of the Vellore and Tiruvannamai districts. We never saw a taxi cab or a bus, except for a truck and an occasional biker. Deadly hairpin beds came up as we started to descend the forest hill. We could never take our foot off the brake and snake like bends downhill got our adrenaline pumping with every breath taking view of the fields and valley below and the small town of Amirthi lay far down in the valley. The road became muddy and we had to slow down further. Deep in our hearts we wanted
Contemplating the forest at Amirthi
to stop for more photo shoots, but our instincts told us to keep going with the night approaching and we were nowhere close to our destination. The scene that lay in front of us was like a dirt bike video game and little by little the road became gradually straight and we reached the foothills of the forest, past Amirthi and the regular route in the plains led us to Kaniyambadi where we braked at the closed railway gate. 07.00 p.m. Jay and Anand were googling on their phones for a shorter route while we waited for the passenger train to pass by.

The train passed, the gate opened to road traffic and it was decided that the town of Arni was the next point of halt. It was the state highway and the traffic was bit heavy. We ripped once again at 60 plus with rain drops wetting us and after a substantial amount of time had passed we reached the Arni junction where Anand and Jay wanted to proceed straight to Vandavasi to go to kalpakkam. We were left alone to take the left road to Cheiyyar. The decision was crucial. The road to Cheyyar looked very

dark and not inviting at all to me especially and if I took that left, I had to do it alone. Many confused decisions were made but we stopped finally at another Thalapakattu Biriyani joint at Arni. Finally Jai took the best decision. I had a great sense of relief and my anxiety was terminated when he said that he and Anand would ride with us back to Chennai. It was evident he did not want us to travel alone as it was well past 09.00 pm by the time we finished dinner.

Dinner brightened us up and the rain stopped for awhile. We rode back to the Arni junction and took the right turn once again to Cheyyar. The road was dark as black and together we notched up to 60 plus once again keeping our bulls steady within the vicinity of one another. The ride was just awesome! State highway, little traffic but our headlamps were doing their jobs which rendered a good sight of the road ahead in the night. My right knee started to pain and no amount of Volini spray was going to help and I had no option but to stretch my leg
Memories - Javadhu Hills
on to the crash bar of the bullet with my left feet still on the brake. I dared not to lift that leg off come what may! The route seemed longer than we thought. Most of the villages in between had retired for the night. Only a few lights were on at that time of the night as we rode on, finally entering into Kanchipuram district and within a few minutes we reached the town of Cheyyar where we had the opportunity of having tea at the only shop that was open. No sooner that we left Cheyyar that my petrol flow switched on to the reserve tank and we were forced to return back to Cheyyar. The kind petrol pump attendant filled up the tanks of our bulls and just as we were about to start back, mobiles started to flash with calls started flowing in from our families, who, were by now wondering where on earth we were! We took up the same speed back on the same road from Cheyyar, without any more worry about empty fuel tanks. With my right leg placed back on the crash bar in the same posture, left leg on the brake,
RG350 LOGO FINAL NEW FONT copy
not changing any rider-pillion places, we ripped through the night towards Kanchipuram on the state highway.

It was a clean ride and we stayed together, only slowing down at the speed bumps when we crossed the villages. The next 50 kilometers was easy and at well past 12 we neared Kanchipuram and just at the entry Jai and Anand were almost about to be stopped by a half naked man whose intentions we did not know but found to be suspicious though he backed away at the sight of the second bullet right behind them ! We took the right turn just before Kanchipuram and followed the military road that led us to Walajabad, the same town where we met Jai, Jag and Anand for the first time on the trip yesterday. Stopping for a brief halt, we pulled on after Walajabad on the vandalur highway, past factories and industrial estates and sleepy villages and the tension slowly eased out of me, when I noticed that we were eating up kilometer after kilometer heading towards home. Jai and Anand were nowhere to be found ahead of us they were too fast and I could not catch up with them. It still made me feel somewhat uncomfortable to contemplate the situation if we had been left alone to manage the journey between Arni and Walajabad in the dark rainy night. It was indeed a perfect decision by Jayaraj that night at Arni ! We reached the manivakkam junction where we turned left and proceeded towards mudichur and the roads brightened up with lights and call taxis with call center employees were travelling on the road which was a welcome sight and we reached Tambaram on to the GST road to Chennai.

It was 25 kilometers to home and the city was alive as ever! We crossed every junction and airport and in no time I was climbing the Kathipara flyover bridge to Ashok Nagar and Nungambakkam. Turning left off the Poonamalle High Road, I stopped my bullet finally to drop off Wesley and it was at that time Anand called me to check on me. It was nice to know that they had reached a little earlier back home and after a brief halt I drove slowly back home at 03.15 am, Monday morning, 13th of July 2015.

It may have been an unethical longer time for this journey of 600 kilometers which took us 28 hours on the whole, but we rode up 3 hill ranges and forest territories, state highways, national highways, plains, nights, rains and dust to accomplish this journey.

To others it may seem strange in many ways but for us it was a journey of dreams, an amazing experience which made me to write this blog, to experience the thrill of riding a bullet on such a long journey, riding the hills for the very first time, the amount of time I spent on getting my bull ready for this trip, considering the fact that I had no alternative rider for the entire journey, a test to each of us, to our physical and mental capability and endurability, which, stretched beyond our imagination and fitness levels. We proved, not only to the disbelieving and to the non interested, but also to ourselves that we could do it! It is certainly a great pride to know that the club Right Gear 350 has a true spirit of riding the way Jai put it in his own words. Many have missed out this truly amazing trip which as I had earlier said cannot be expressed in photo captions or words, because every rider needs to put his heart and soul onto his bike and the trip to make it memorable forever, for those who chose to ride, the road ahead is always filled with hidden excitement!

My sincere and whole hearted thanks to all the riders on this Yelagiri trip 2015 who made sure it was a absolute sensational success !

It is not a chance, but choice to be a motor bike rider, because ‘Destiny to ride is not by chance, but by choice’

Dedicated to all motorbike riders out there, who are still exploring unknown destinations as I write this blog.

Me, Cape Comorin

Dear All

Greetings from Cape Comorin – the southernmost tip of India. It certainly feels like an achievement to have arrived here, being perhaps the third most important cape in the world, after Cape Horn and the Cape of Good Hope. It is also the meeting point of three major seas of the world: the Arabian Sea, the Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean. It is a stunning location, with wonderfully rough seas and strong winds, and definitely one of the highlights of my trip thus far.

I believe in my last I mentioned that my journey was to take more of a swing towards Hinduism and its temples, and this has indeed turned out to be the case. They say that Tamil Nadu is the most fervently Hindu state in India, and this has certainly been evidenced by my experiences in two of its major temples over the last few days. The fervour of the religious devotees has been palpable, and although I must admit it bordered somewhat on the frenetic today, it has been thoroughly fascinating to witness.

So I write from where I last left off at Pondicherry, and having spent a couple of
Gopuram

wonderful days a stone’s throw away from the Indian Ocean, I made a rather interesting journey to my next destination, Madurai. This involved waiting in my hotel room till around noon, which I do not like to do when I travel as I prefer to start early and get as much of the journey covered as soon as possible. I took an ordinary (non-AC, though actually preferable as when the bus gets going, you really get the drafts coming in, and the open windows afford some wonderfully scenic views) government bus 40km to the nearest major train junction at a small town called Villupuram. This was a hectic journey, lasting around 1.5 hours. I had secured a seat for myself, but with absolutely nowhere to put my large backpack, it ended up on my knee with my smaller one at my feet. The only person who could fit in on the seat next to me was a diminutive lady, who was very understanding of the fact that my backpack had to rest on part of her lap too. So understanding in fact that she was asleep for most of the journey, with her head bobbing on and off my shoulder

the whole way. On the opposite side there was a gentleman throwing up for most of the journey, which I had to try to put out of my mind as the bus just continued to fill up, eventually with more people seemingly stood up than sat down. A hectic journey, with lots of shouting, a bit of pushing at times, but eventually it got me and my backpacks there, with the desire to avoid non-AC government buses again for as long as possible. Wondering how I was then going to spend the next 2.5 hours on a hot, dusty Indian station platform in the middle of nowhere, I discovered the most welcoming delights of the Indian Station Retiring Rooms system. These are like hotel rooms, only at the station, and with minimal facilities and comfort. But still, checking into one for two hours gave me a chance to lie down and chill in my own space, waiting very comfortably for my train. And when it came and I boarded one of its carriages in “AC Chair Class”, I was reminded of the thorough pleasure of Indian rail travel from my trip here ten years ago. Most of the journey I
Me and some new friends
Cape Comorin
spent on the in-between carriages bit, with the door wide open, gazing out across the beautiful Indian rural landscapes, farms and villages, with a monsoon downpour at one time pouring down blankets of rain upon the countryside, and later a stunning sunset over distant rocky, boulder-type outcrops. A wonderful six hours later I arrived at my destination, having really understood what is meant by the enjoyment of travel being not so much in the arrival, but in the journey itself. A wonderful experience.

Still, arriving at 9.30pm it was straight to my hotel room, and straight to bed. I was given a super-deluxe, temple-view double room for the price of a standard room, and was not disappointed in my stay at the Hotel Supreme, Madurai.

The next day, I explored the main attraction of Madurai, its nationally renowned Meenakshi Amman Temple, dubbed the Taj Mahal of the south. Rather strict entrance rules meant I had to don trousers and leave my camera at the entrance, so photos here were taken on my mobile phone (which was allowed) and are thus a bit blurred. The temple was originally built in the 17th century, by local ruler Tirumalai Nayak, of
Hindu devotee
Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai
the Nayak dynasty once prosperous in the region. It is best-known for its 12 stunning gopurams, entrance towers encrusted with hundreds of statues of gods, goddesses, demons and heroes – apparently the south gopuram alone has 1,511 of them. This was followed by a visit to Tirumalai Nayak’s palace nearby, a beautiful building of courtyards, columns, arches and domed roofs. Not quite so touristy, the rest of the day was spent in a Vodafone shop, spending two hours entangled in Indian bureaucracy (involving passport copies, visa copies, passport photos, proof of address, a call to the hotel where I was staying at, connection confirmation and so on and so forth…) in order to obtain an Indian SIM card – a highly useful acquisition to my travel goods in order to make hotel reservations in advance without having to search for a local telephone booth, and well worth the wait. I also bought a very basic, non-touch screen non-smartphone phone as my English phone, as they always are, is locked. It took a while to convince the salespersons that seriously, all I wanted was a mobile to make mobile telephone calls with and nothing else, call me old-fashioned!!

And yesterday,
Nandhi Bull, Meenakshi Amman Temple
The Nandhi bull is Shiva's vehicle, each Hindu god has a vehicle upon which it travels. Shiva's is a bull.
another wonderful journey, that I was again originally dreading but in the end turned out to be amazing. This was six hours in a non-AC government bus from Madurai to here, Kanyakumari or Cape Comorin. I was not looking forward to it after my previously mentioned hectic experience in a government non-AC bus from Pondicherry to Villupuram, along with something that had vaguely disagreed with my stomach the evening before. In the end though, it was a journey which really drove it home to me that I am actually travelling again, opening up the sheer sense of freedom that is felt by being on the open road. There is generally a time for me, usually by the end of the first week of my travels, where I get this blissful feeling which reminds me why I travel the open road – the sense of the world just being out there ready for me to immerse myself in. I experienced this this time in a beautifully breezy, nearly-empty bus zooming down the highway towards the southern tip of India, past rice fields and romantic rural landscapes and with the ever-looming presence of the Western Ghats hills coming closer in the distance.
Thousand Pillar Hall
Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai
A fantastic journey, and what a fantastic two days I have had since arriving, exploring the very southern tip of India.

Cape Comorin is the British name for the rocky outcrop marking the southern, triangular-pointed end of India. In India it is now called Kanyakumari – Kanya meaning “virgin” and Kumari being the Hindu goddess of the ocean, and thus the town is dedicated to the Hindu Virgin Goddess of the Sea. Today I think has been the highlight of my trip so far. Not only is this just an amazing location to be in, with waves crashing from three seas all around onto stunning rocky outcrops and islands, I have been really blown away by my visit this morning to the Kumari Amman Temple dedicated to the sea goddess herself. There are very few foreign tourists here, as in the whole of Tamil Nadu, and I noted that this temple seemed to be one of the very few in India to allow non-Hindu tourists into its Inner Sanctum. The Inner Sanctum is the part in the centre of a Hindu temple which is considered the holiest as it houses the “murti” of the god/goddess to whom the temple
Pudhu Mandapa
Entrance hall to the Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai
is devoted. A “murti” is a statue believed to be infused with the very spirit of the god/goddess him/herself. This means that when a Hindu looks into the face of the murti, they truly believe that they are looking into the face of a god. The murtis are thus treated with utmost devotion, being washed, clothed, fed in the form of food offerings, and sometimes even put to bed at night. Since the Inner Sanctum is so holy, Hindus rarely allow non-Hindus into this part, but in this temple I was allowed to enter. What an experience! I am mostly aware of people having to cover themselves up in temples, wearing trousers and something to cover the shoulders. However, in this temple, not only did male devotees have to remove their shoes (and socks), they also had to remove their shirt. This felt very strange, to be in a holy place wearing only my shorts, but actually felt extremely freeing as well as enabling me to fit in with the other worshippers around me. I was lucky to visit during the puja (worship ceremony), which involved quite frenetic bell-ringing, clapping, horn-blowing, and chanting. There were just so many people, at
Flagpole
Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai
times pushing and shouting, it became very hot, and in the end quite frenetic with one lady being forcibly removed by the temple priests for pushing in. I initially felt quite ill at ease, wondering what would happen if one of the priests did not know that the entrance guards had let me, a non-Hindu foreigner in, but they were all very very friendly to me, shaking my hand, as were the devotees who offered wonderful smiles, and one showering me with holy water. This was a truly unique experience, and I am so glad to have done it. I have never been inside the Inner Sanctum of a temple in India before, and the memory will stay with me for a long time. Of course I have no photos of this, as no cameras were allowed inside, but I do feel very blessed to have been there, and maybe even more confident in teaching about Hinduism in my classes next year.

Indeed, my time in Kanyakumari has been just great. There is something quite special here, in the joyful atmosphere of the tourists who have travelled thousands of miles to come to the southernmost tip of their country,
Temple Tank
Meenakshi Amman Temple, Madurai
in the wonderfully refreshing strong ocean breezes, the crashing waves against the rocky outcrops, and the stunning monument to the Hindu holy man Swami Vivekananda and statue of Tamil poet Thiruvalluvar built on two islands lying just off the coast.

So, it is from this incredible point on the southernmost tip of India that I sign out for this time, having the most amazing time and experiences down here. Tomorrow I catch a morning train back northwards again, but this time into Kerala. I am looking forward to this very much, as according to the Lonely Planet, Kerala is like “India through the Looking Glass” – India, but not quite as you know her – a ""blissed-out...world away from the frenzy of elsewhere"". This sounds good to me, and my first stop is a place called Kollam (Quilon), the southern gateway to the famous backwaters of Kerala.

So, until my next which will most likely be from Kerala, thanks for reading, and all the best.

Chennai, from St Thomas Mount
Dear All

Greetings! I write my first proper entry on this trip from the beautiful French colonial town of Pondicherry, hence the “Chennai to ‘Cherry” title. My trip has got off to a great start, and I feel the blessed freedom from my MA in taking a step out of my life in London, seeing things from a distance (which is always good), and being seriously infected once more with this wonderful thing they call the travel bug. What a joy, and what a wonderful few days these last ones have been. I will recount the details in this first entry, from the touch-down in Chennai to the sitting in this blissful, air-conditioned, crisp, white-sheeted room with a balcony directly overlooking the Indian Ocean.

After two relatively short long-haul hops from London to Dubai, and then Dubai to Chennai (Madras), I arrived rather jet-lagged and bleary-eyed on Friday morning in this city they call the younger sibling of India’s Big Four. What Chennai lacks in tourist sights and activities compared with Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta, it more than makes up for in its sheer Indian authenticity, being way off the beaten tourist track. The 90-minute taxi journey from the
Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception Cathedral
Pondicherry
airport to my YWCA guesthouse was an immediate wake-up call that I was in India, and passing through the dense traffic, rickshaw throttles and fumes, scores of pedestrians, and sheer chaos of the Indian roads, I was reminded constantly that “TII” – a phrase I have adapted from my experiences in Africa, “TIA” or “This Is Africa”, when one needs to remind oneself that one is no longer at home, and that things are done differently there – “This Is India”!. A serious wake-up call it was, although mellowed greatly by my arrival (90 sweaty minutes later!) at the lush gardens and serenity of the YWCA guesthouse, great choice for my first two nights in the country.

The rest of the day I spent both fighting the jet-lag, and familiarising myself with the way things are here. This involved a two-hour stroll around the local area, known as Egmore and near one of Chennai’s main rail termini. I was quickly reminded that Indian pavements are meant more for sleeping vagrant-types and all manner of smelly things, and that the pedestrian is to walk along the edge of the road itself, mere inches away from the passing rickshaws and motorbikes.
Pondicherry Street
I also had to pluck up the courage to make my first crossing of one of these darn roads, involving a fairly determined attitude towards getting to the other side, trusting that the rickshaws and motorbikes coming towards you know that you are there and will adjust their line of travel accordingly. It is the larger, air-conditioned cars which you have to watch out for, the drivers who seem to be in a bubble away from the rest of the traffic and pedestrians, and who drive oblivious to it all assuming that everything will move around and avoid it, which it normally does. I was surprised not to see a cow in the road in Chennai at all during my stay there, as I remember this was a common sight even in the cities of the North on my last visit to India ten years ago. Either it is different in the south, or things have slowly been modernising since my last visit. My stroll also involved many friendly looks, stares and hellos from passers-by, as well as the occasional soliciting of services in the forms of rickshaw rides and restaurants. A successful activity indeed, and I returned to the
Chennai Egmore Train Station
YWCA with a much more confident understanding of how things are (again) in India.

The next day, my first full day in India, I had also planned to get used to things here, and decided to see the sights of the city by flagging down rickshaw drivers, getting a feel for the difference between the price that some of them want to charge you, and the price which they should be charging you. I found out from this escapade that they can request more than double what a journey should cost you, and that a firm but friendly approach of sticking to your guns, and making every effort to walk away when you’re not happy with their price, seems the best way to do things. Also to trust your instincts with the rickshaw driver – some just exude an air of unreliability and rip-offs, others seem much more amicable and agreeable. The former types seem to find you, whilst the latter you find them. Indeed, a useful day of familiarising myself with the TII system here.

So, familiarisation complete, I enjoyed a wonderful day of tourist-free sightseeing around Chennai. First up, the Fort St George, overlooking the Indian
Motorbikes, Chennai Egmore Train Station
Ocean to the east of the modern city. This was the first trading post built by the British East India Company in the whole of India, in 1653, and I found it fascinating to think that this was where the whole of the British colonial era in India pretty much began. Today it is mainly home to government offices and headquarters, but there was a small museum open to visitors with fascinating colonial pieces, and the nearby St Mary’s Church, built in 1680, and Britain’s oldest surviving church in India, and according to a sign on the way in, supposedly also the first British one built east of Suez.

After this, a short rickshaw-hop south took me to the San Thome Cathedral, supposedly built upon a tomb which once housed the remains of St Thomas the Apostle. I am not too sure how much of what it told here is based on truth, myth or legend, but as it goes, St Thomas is supposed to have travelled to India to preach the Good News not long after the death of Jesus. He was generally welcomed in India, and made his base around Chennai. One legend has it that a
Rickshaws
local chieftain requested the assistance of St Thomas when a huge tree trunk became trapped in a river, flooding nearby farmland. He had heard that St Thomas could perform miracles using the Girdle of the Virgin Mary, which she is said to have given St Thomas upon her assumption into heaven. St Thomas merely touched the trunk with the girdle, and the locals were able to move it aside with ease. I mention this story also as a huge splinter said to be from the original log is displayed in a dodgy area immediately behind the cathedral and is still believed to be miraculous today, after it supposedly prevented the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami flooding and damaging the cathedral. The cathedral is built upon what used to be the final resting place of St Thomas before his remains were transported to Italy. There still exists a chapel there, displaying one of the bone fragments of the apostle.

And the final stop on my Chennai tour, a long rickshaw ride out to the south of the city, towards what is called the St Thomas Mount. This is a small hill on the city’s outskirts, with sweeping views north towards the
Fort St George, Chennai
urban and chaotic sprawl of Chennai, upon which legend also has it that St Thomas was martyred, by a local attacking him with a spear. Indeed, the spearhead itself is displayed back at the San Thome Cathedral. Here, at the top of this mount, lies a small shrine built by the Portuguese in 1523, commemorating his martyrdom, and his apostleship in India. A beautiful place to be indeed, St Thomas being one of my favourite apostles in his natural human instinct of desiring to see in order to believe, as well as his profoundly simple proclamation upon believing, “My Lord and My God”, a common phrase amongst the Christians of Chennai in remembrance of their local apostle and saint.

So Chennai, a lovely start to my journey around India. My second stop I arrived in yesterday, having taken a four-hour government air-conditioned bus south along the coast to Pondicherry. Pondicherry, along with Goa and a couple of other places, remained an anomaly throughout the British colonial era, being founded and run by the distinct global power of the French. Whilst mostly Indian today, the town does exude a French ambience in its French Quarter to the south, with smaller,
San Thome Cathedral, Chennai
quieter tree-lined streets of French colonial houses and mansions. There are also three hugely impressive churches spread around the centre of town, along with a good dose of French cafes serving croissants, baguettes and some darned good coffee!

Rather than stay in one of the numerous refurbished French houses, which was still a tempting option, I chose to stay in what is called an “Ashram Guesthouse”. Ashrams are religious and/or spiritual centres and communities which are ubiquitous throughout India, each rather unique and often headed by a single guru or teacher, living either in person or in memory. The main ashram in Pondicherry is called the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, and was founded in 1926 by a man called Sri (or Saint) Aurobindo, and a French-born lady known as “the Mother”. From what I gather, the ashram does not teach ways or paths to enlightenment, but enables its members to find their own way, through personal and internal reflection and meditation. It does not appear to be religious, more spiritual, although it believes in the divine and the achievement of a form of divine consciousness. As well as the Ashram centre in Pondicherry, the community has also created its own
St Thomas Relics
The spearhead which was said to have martyred St Thomas, and a fragment of his bone
township just to the north of Pondicherry, called “Auroville”. Unfortunately my time here does not allow a visit to such a fascinating place, but the settlement is home to over 2000 inhabitants from over 40 nationalities, living in universal, cash-free harmony together. It sounds very interesting indeed, and as a result, instead of being able to visit, I decided to book myself into one of the three “Ashram Guesthouses” that the community runs in Pondicherry. Rather than being a spartan, monastic-cell type abode one might expect, this is a stunning room with a balcony directly overlooking the seafront and the Indian Ocean. The air-conditioning, two ceiling fans, fridge, hot water bathroom, and in-room wifi add to the comfort of the place. Perhaps I’m not experiencing the communal living as experienced by the Sri Aurobindo members, but its guesthouse has a good vibe and is a lovely retreat from the heat and bustle of the Pondicherry streets.

So after arriving yesterday, I just planned an afternoon stroll along the seafront, which actually enabled a most wonderful encounter with two fantastic Turkish visitors, Mehmet and his wife Esra, both very spiritually minded. Over French food and coffee, we discussed such amazing
View towards the Indian Ocean from San Thome Cathedral
This is said to be a splinter of a log which St Thomas miraculously moved for a local ruler nearby. It is also believed that this splinter has miraculous powers today, having supposedly prevented the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami from passing and damaging the Cathedral!
things as Sufism, ultimate reality and angels. Following this, evening mass in French at the Notre Dame des Anges church, interrupted by a stunning monsoon storm, and a huge bolt of lightning just outside the building which made everyone jump and a few children cry. And finally, a wander back to my guesthouse, stopping by at the Sri Manakula Vinayagar Temple on the way. The Hindu temple is dedicated to the elephant-headed god Ganesh, and as such has a resident elephant who gives pilgrims and visitors (and the odd tourist like myself!) a pat on the head upon the offering of a small cash donation (which it takes willingly with its trunk, and goodness knows where it ends up – I did not see any coins being snuffed out again…!!). Fascinating!

And today, after a wonderful sleep, just a leisurely exploration of the town, its beautiful French-flavoured backstreets, three churches, and wonderful seaside ambience.

These last few days have been great, thoroughly enjoyable, and a very positive start to my journey around the south of India. It has been very much Christian-themed so far, and I believe my trip tomorrow may take a turn more towards the (majority)
A typical view from the back of a rickshaw!
Hindu side of India. This is all fascinating to me, after having taught Religious Education for four years now and completed my MA in the subject – it’s almost like a reccy into the real world of religion, and spirituality, with India to my mind being one of the global hotspots for religious interest and diversity. I am certainly hoping that this trip, as well as being part of my huge enthusiasm for travelling the world, may even deepen my subject knowledge and understanding of religion and religions for the next academic year…!

Next up, I head towards Madurai tomorrow, for probably the longest leg of my trip. I had thought of originally catching a five-hour bus to Trichy (with two famous temples, one at the top of a huge rocky outcrop in the middle of town, and the other supposedly the largest temple in India), and then a three-hour bus to Madurai the following day. However, with one of India’s most popular temples at Madurai, and one more at its southern-most tip at Cape Comorin which I aim to visit after, I thought this may be doing a bit of a temple-overload. Thus, I have managed to book
On the way up to St Thomas Mount
myself onto a 6-hour train leaving a town called Villupuram, around 40km from Pondicherry, directly bound for Madurai (instead of stopping in Trichy along the way). This does mean I need to take a bus or train tomorrow morning to Villupuram, as well as arriving in Madurai around 10pm. Whilst I don’t really like to arrive in a new place so late, it does seem like a good option to miss out Trichy, to hopefully spend a bit more time in Kerala later. Anyway, we will see, what will be will be, and after all, TII (This Is India…!!).

Thanks for reading, and until the next time!

All the best

ECR road is famous for sun sand but there are few places you can do much more than that.

Mudaliarkuppam is one of them. To any north Indian the word is more or less like a tongue twister.





I knew that I won’t be able to pronounce it correctly and on enquiring about direction from local people I will end up in getting a strange weird look from them as if I am mentally retarded and My IQ level is so low that I can’t pronounce simple words correctly.

It has been a frustrating experience to keep on repeating the same word again and again and still it doesn't rings a bell to people.

So this time I acted smart and had it googled and Wikipedia page was open so that I can simply flash out my mobile and avoid ignominy.

There are low Floor Buses to Pondicherry plying on the ECR road all the time. I boarded one of them from ECR road. On asking for ticket to Mudaliarkuppam conductor asked driver to stop the bus and asked me to get down and take some other bus. He informed bus won’t
IMG_1273
stop at Mudaliarkuppam. On pleading he finally agreed to get me to the nearest stop to Mudaliarkuppam which will be kalpakkam.

Boarded another bus at kalpakkam which was seriously overcrowded and I was again informed that the bus won’t stop at Mudaliarkuppam but three KM ahead at Odiyur and I have to take an auto and come back again . I seriously don’t understand why the government department managing Buses on highway want’s people to take that much of pain. Why there is no stop near a tourist hotspot.

Mudaliarkuppam is also known as Boat house.

After travelling for 3 hour in scorching heat I was so hungry that I was even ready to eat idly but nothing was available. Yes, there is not a single restaurant in vicinity. The nearest one is a good 2 KM away. So there was no point in contemplating about it.

There is this vast expense of water which is known as Odiyur Lake. This lake is formed by backwater which was brimming with activity. Gull-billed terns flying and hitting water with accuracy and fetching fishes. Local villagers were spreading net in water.it was 3:30 and boat house closes by
IMG_1337
5:00.

Checked the rate list of activities guess what 5 minutes of water scooter for 600 Rs.

I mean 5 minutes, you at least need 15 minutes to get a feel of it and good 1 hour to actually experience it but that can cost you 7200.For that money you can actually buy a water scooter on EMI and enjoy i.e. wonder why they have been priced so steep the plausible reason I can think of is “to discourage people from hiring scooter for 1 hour because in 1 hour is good enough to run off with the scooter”.

I always wanted to experience kayaking primarily because it’s thrilling and secondary because it’s physically very demanding. I was told that not carry anything as everything will get wet. I though paddling might splash some water but to my horror when I sat in kayak water filled in from the holes in the kayak and it was an awkward situation.

Honestly I have never done kayaking before. My understanding of kayak was a small boat but the case was not so.

Kayak has got holes at the bottom from which some water will rush in once
IMG_1343
you board on it.

So basically you will be paddling all wet hence you need extra pair of clothes. Since it’s a strenuous job

You need to have some water which you can sip and a cap would be great.

All set, I took my kayak in water went for 500 meters and came back.it was serious fun and I thoroughly enjoyed the whole experience. I knew by now that I will be coming to this place quite often for kayaking.



After coming back I saw two families going for motor boat and this was an opportunity to tag along. So on requesting they agreed but the six seater motor boat had no seat vacant for me “we are already six”, “where you will sit” . Deck was the only place I can fit in. It was tough managing there on deck of the boat as there was nothing to latch on to when the boat hit water it was very difficult at times I seriously felt that I might fall in water. I think I was lucky that I survived, won’t do it again.

I managed to get some beautiful sunset pics
IMG_1344
and decided to call it a day. I was informed that the nearest restaurant is 2 km away on ECR road in Chennai direction. Decide to walk down to the place to get a feel of the activity going nearby. Saw a guy in full gear going to coconut tree. Lush green rice farm with aroma in air was very soothing to eyes.

I was walking on the highway at my own leisurely pace taking pics, I heard somebody shouting “hey brother” .I looked back and saw a guy on a bike asking me to take a ride. This was very touching I mean somebody offering lift without even being asked for. I was overwhelmed with emotions and was thinking what a noble soul and how thoughtful. These are the people who are keeping humanity alive.

The guy came close and stopped the bike and asked me to hop on. I was in almost in tears filled with bromance till I could clearly smell the foul odor of wine. The guy was clearly on high and in that state he was driving on highway stopping at will to get killed. But now he was standing close and almost
IMG_1355
shouting to sit on his bike. Now the truth dawned on me why he was so eager to give me a ride. The only time my friends would call to enquire whether I have reached home safely was when they were totally drunk.

Such is the effect of this nectar of heaven that it can turn any Stanger in to an ambassador of humanity.

Just imagine the consequence if US government sponsors alcohol party on india-pak border therw will be no border at all.

Not sure why but I couldn’t say anything and sat on the bike and after that this guy dropped me on an eating joint. Had some bhajji and tea. Again got a lift from a biker who dropped me in middle of nowhere on road and went to a village I couldn’t see any light in any direction it was like no man’s land.

There was no sign of civilization. Confession: - I was very frightened. The problem is that buses will only stop at their designated stop. Finally a got lucky when a biker stopped by but this ride was like a nightmare. I am not sure if he was on
IMG_1360
drugs or what. This guy had only thing in mind to overtake anything and everything. He had a 100 cc hero bike but he was straining it to the brink and overtaking suv on the highway. It was very dark and visibility was less, single lane road and this guy hell bent on getting me killed. I could see an eminent death at any second. The thought that since I was riding pillion so I might survive as in most of the accidents the pillion rider only receives injuries but then few years back a friend of mine who was riding pillion died in a bike accident. I could see his face and it seemed like that now the time has come to meet him .I was totally hopeless and praying god to save my life and excuse me for all the mistakes. I mean it will be too soon still want to live another decade at least. Then suddenly the grunt of the bike died and it stopped .the engine died and the bike won’t start. The guy came to me and said “sorry bro” and I was happy , relieved and said “thank you” .Guess what my faith
IMG_1267
in god has emboldened. I could see sign of human civilization here. Soon got an auto and reached kalpakam which is famous for atomic energy research. It’s a small town and has got few good restaurant had dinner here and took bus for Chennai from here.

At the tea estate
Will the mist ever clear to give us a decent view of the Nilgiri Hills? We set off optimistic as ever, this time to a couple of viewpoints a few kilometres out of Coonoor. First up is Lamb’s Rock. Mr Hussain enters into heated discussion with a man lurking at the entrance then tells us he will show us round for 100 rupees. On the basis that Mr Hussain usually warns us off guides, we agree. It’s billed as a trek but in fact consists of a round trip of just a kilometre. As ever, the view into the valleys is shrouded in mist, but the guide does show us lemon grass growing wild. He points out a village that has appeared in the valley a couple of thousand feet below us. “Tribal people live down there” he says disdainfully. “Are you Adivsasi?” asks David. “No no no” he says quickly. “I am a proper Indian”. He may be a Dalit, but he is not a tribal, tribals being considered the lowest of the low in Indian society.

The next viewpoint has even less of a view, though we are still extorted 20 rupees by an attendant for turning up.
Highfields tea estate Coonoor
These people are clearly tribals, you can tell in one glance that they are not Tamils. However by now the mist is lifting and the scenery as we drive along is beautiful. You can see why the British liked to escape up here in the summer. We wend our way through tea estates, with bright green bushes all trimmed to a regulation height of about three feet, and tiny tracks, almost too narrow to count as a path, winding between the rows of bushes. The tea fields are planted at intervals with a particular type of oak tree that collects rainwater and then releases it into the ground from its roots to moisten the roots of the tea plants, as well as providing shade from the fierce sun. It is early enough in the morning for there to be few other tourists, and we relish the quiet beauty of the place.

Back into Coonoor, we drive through the smart end of town, where old Edwardian bungalows with names such as ‘Faraway’ or ‘Glendower’ mingle with large new houses of considerable affluence. Here and there the hillside is being ripped out in big red streaked terraces to make space for
Cutting the tea inot tea dust
a new house. Next stop is Sim's Park, another botanical garden, established during the Raj, by one of Our Chaps, of course. It’s smaller but better maintained than the one in Ooty and has far fewer visitors. It is peaceful until we near the tiny lake where people have rented pedalos. They make a shrieking creaking noise with every turn of the pedal, drowning out the birds. We amble slowly up and down the hillside. At one point there is an unbelievably strong smell of citronella, but our botanical knowledge does not extend to working out which tree it is coming from.

Finally, we head to Highfield tea estate. This was the first tea factory in the Nilgiris, originally owned by the British but sold to an Indian company in 1974. The estate has 300 acres, and employs 300 people, 250 picking tea and 50 in the factory. We learn that the bushes are harvested every 15 days in peak season, but less at this time of year when many of the bushes have suffered some frost damage which means then leaves then burn in the sun. We are shown round the factory. The bright green tea leaves initially
Drying the tea
go onto big drying beds where air is pumped up form below for 10 hours to dry them. From there they go to the cutting room. The high quality tea is cut, and the cheaper stuff (which uses the bigger leaves) goes through a series of cutters and rollers to reduce it to dust. The leaves/dust are then soaked in water, dried again, oxidised, and finally roasted. Once roasted, they pass over a series of filters, to separate the different sizes of leaf/dust, and then bagged up. The factory is not big, but it produces 2½ tons of tea a day. The smell of tea is almost overwhelming as you walk through, quite intoxicating.

The tour is free but the quid pro quo is that you are invited to visit the shop afterwards. That is not a hardship, as most of what’s on sale – tea, spices, essential oils – is very cheap compared to home. No holiday would be complete without something slightly inconvenient to fit into the luggage, after all! We do, however, steer clear of the essential oils, fearful of the risk of leakage in transit. Nobody wants a suitcase full of clothes reeking of eucalyptus
The Nilgiris
oil or lemon grass!

Once again, the hotel garden makes a pleasant place to sit out for the afternoon. The sun is shining, the birds flit in and out of the garden, and David starts to reminisce as he hears the tooting of the steam engine bringing the afternoon train from Mettapullayam into Coonoor station in the valley far below. The sun begins to drop and the mist starts to blanket the Nilgiris again.

The peace is suddenly disturbed by the arrival of two macaque monkeys, attracted by the open bag of nuts being consumed by two Englishwomen sitting at a nearby table. Initially the monkeys limit themselves to threatening calls, and are scared off by the hotel staff throwing stones at them. But gradually they get bolder and shimmy down a water pipe to seize the bag of nuts and a handbag. Fortunately they drop the bag but the nuts are speedily consumed. Thus emboldened, they raid the nearby waste bin which contains the remains of our lunch, and speed off clutching a red plastic bag. The Englishwomen are shocked, to say the least, having not realised how aggressive and thieving macaques are.

We retreat indoors
Always more mist...
as it gets cooler, only to be disturbed by a thunderclap noise like a firework going off. We peer outside to try to work out the source f the noise, only to smell cordite. One of the hotel staff has been taking pot shots at the monkeys after our neighbours complained. Nobody knows if he got one.



Everton are playing Arsenal so we order room service and eat grimacing in front of the TV.

Wild bull elephant
Another totally awesome experience. From Ooty we travelled by car through more winding roads and 36 hairpin turns on the decent to Mudumalai, which is still in the Nilgiris, but at a much lower elevation. We had booked a one night stay at Forest Hills Farm and Guest House, located of the edge of the sanctuary. Well were greeted at the gate by the owner Savita and her son Sameer. We felt like we were old friends returning after a long absence. Shortly after arrival they arranged a driver and jeep to take us on safari. He took us around the boundary of the park,then into the sanctuary where we boarded a bus to go deeper into the forest. We didn't see any tigers, but we did see a large herd of gaur (Indian bison), chitral (a type of deer), languars and macaques (monkeys) and malibar giant squirrels.Following the bus tour, we were taken to the elephant camp where we observed food preparation and feeding of some very large tuskers We then had another ride in the jeep for another spin around the perimiter of the park at dusk, when the animals are on the move. Here we spotted a herd

Chitral
of wild elephants. So wonderful to see them free and moving around in the forest untethered.

Following the safari, we were treated to a scrumptious dinner, lovingly prepared by our host. We spent a wonderful night in the compound a little away from the main building. It was great to be out there because we could here the calls and movements of the wild animals in the night. All in all this was a fantastic experience, so much so, that we changed our plans and stayed an extra night! This is one place I would go back to in a heart beat.

We travelled hrs by car from Kodaikanal to Mettupalayum, the starting point for the ""toy train"". This was only an overnight stop, as there is nothing there. Had an early night as we had to be up at 3:30 AM to line up for tickets for the train. We had tried to make reservations two weeks before, but all reserved seats were sold, so we had to line up for two of the 25 standby seats. We were lucky we got there when we did, because some of the people that came behind us didn't get on. It was a very pleasant 5 hour journey up hill all the way to Ooty. The toy train is a small gauge train that was built by the British in the early 1900's to transport people out of the heat of the plains to the coolness of the hill stations. It is pulled (or rather pushed) by a small, specially built steam engine. The total distance from Mettupalayam to Ooty is only 47km, but takes a long time because of the steep grade, and the stops along the way for water for the steam engine. It was very scenic and very enjoyable.

We spent a few days exploring the highlights of Ooty. Took a trip up to Dodabetta, at 2638 meters it is the second highest peak in the western Ghatts, and did a day trip to Coonoor to visit some of the mountain attractions there.

Have a bad internet connection so can't load photos, will put them with the next entry.

Beauftifully manicured tea plantations
Arrived in Kodaikanal Wed afternoon, after a lovely (sometimes scary) ride through the beautiful hills of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. We hired a car to take us from Munnar to Kodaikanal. A little bit of a splurge, but the alternative was to take an 11 hour bus ride through all the hairpin turns on a very basic, uncomfortable bus. So, the car ride was wonderful; we were able to interact with the driver and he pointed out spots of interest and made stops along the way so we could take photos of the beautiful scenery.

As we pulled up to the hotel, we were stalled by a procession or small parade going by. I have seen documentaries of the things we saw, very interesting. Along with drummers at the front and back of the procession, and many people carrying ceramic bowl of fire there were two men and one women with arrows pierced through both cheeks, and hooks pierced into their backs. Attached to the hooks were ropes and each was pulling a small cart. Another unusual, unexpected event.

Yesterday we went for a walk to the next village, about 6 km (down hill!) through beautiful forest and along
IMG_0223
from a hike in the hills
scenic ridges. This is really a very beautiful area of India. We took a taxi back up to the top, no way were we walking back up, very steep.

Today we are moving on to Mettupalayam, not much to see there, but we hope to catch the ""toytrain"" in the morning, so will only over night there.

Haven't had very many comments, so don't know if you are all getting the blogs, hope you are. Not much time left here now, so will see you all soon.

Letiště
Geo: 10.81, 78.69

Ráno se probouzím sám v posteli a sám vyrážím na snídani. Je to trochu nezvyk po dvou měsících. Vyrážím do stejné kavárny a dávám si oblíbenou kombinaci toastu s cappuccinem. Po snídani se vracím zabalit, vysprchovat a vyrážím na nádraží na vlak do Trichy. Ten má jet v 11:10, ale hned zjišťuji, že má cca 40min zpoždění. Nic se neděje, protože mám do odletu spoustu času a tak usedám na batoh a čekám pozorujíce informační obrazovku. Po chvilce si čekání zkracuji pitím chai a netrvá dlouho a vlak doráží. Mám pouze general ticket, což znamená že nemám žádné rezervované místo a v případě obsazenosti všech míst musím sedět na zemi. To se naštěstí neděje a tak zabírám dvě místa proti sobě ve sleeper class. Na sedačku proti sobě posazuji batůžek aby mě nikdo neotravoval a už si užívám cesty. Je to super pohodlné. Překvapivě mě ani nekontroluje několikrát kolem procházející průvodčí, který vyhazuje kolem všechny kdo nemají místenku, ale mě nějakým záhadným způsobem ignoruje. Cesta utíká poměrně rychle a tak se za nedlouho ocitám na nádraží v Trichy, odkud se vydávám hledat něco dobrého k obědu. Sluníčko paří jako o závod, tak se modlím, abych něco našel co nejdříve.
Letiště
Za nedlouho nacházím poměrně rušnou restauraci, což je znamení, že jídlo bude čerstvé a v pohodě. K mému překvapení tu mají klimatizovanou část, kam mě jako turistu hned posílají. Parádička. Obsluhující personál neovládá angličtinu zrovna bravůrně a tak místo vysvětlování co mají, bere číšník talíř jinému zakázníkovi, aby mi ukázal jestli chci to samé. Dost mě to pobavilo a evidentně i onoho zákazníka 😊. Vypadá to slušně a cena přijatelně takže ok, jdu do toho. Po obdržení mého talíře s mnoha věci na něm se nade mě staví jeden z číšníků a zírá jak jím s tím, že mi ke každé věci říká co to je a jak bych to měl jíst. Po dvou měsících v Indii mi připadá trochu otravný, ale nakonec ho úspěšně ignoruji a užívám si jídlo. S plným žaludkem se vydávám najít nějákou oázu klidu, kde by ideálně byla i klimatizace a internet, abych zabil zbytek času, který tu mám. Letadlo mi letí až o půlnoci, takže času mám spoustu. Nakonec nacházím internet café, kde si kupuji hodinu internetu a trávím zde část času, který mi zbývá. Pak trochu naivně hledám bus na letiště s tím, že tam budou kavárny a internet. Nasedám a vyrážím. Letiště
Já ;)
vypadá celkem moderně, jen jsem jediný kdo tam směřuje. No ono mám taky asi nějakých 7-8hodin do odletu 😊. Při vstupu do haly procházím kontrolou a vojáček se mě ptá zda chci opravdu vstoupit, protože mě pak už nepustí ven a musím tam zůstat. Po závanu chladného vzduch z prostoru haly, která je evidentně klimatizovaná, neváhám ani chvilku a souhlasně kývám, že ok. Netrvá dlouho a objevuji “kavárnu” a překvapivě tu opravdu mají i internet, takže jsem za vodou. Čas tu utíká poměrně rychle a než se naději už se odbavuji a nasedám do letadla. Nashledanou Indie…..

Cement advertising
Indian hill stations are not what we expected. We had a romanticised mental picture of English style buildings dating back to the Raj, clinging to the hillside in small towns. Well, the houses cling to the hillside all right, but traces of the Raj are few and far between. Coonoor and Ooty are both surprisingly large towns, and the 17km drive between them has few stretches that are not also settled. The houses are brightly coloured boxes of different sizes and shapes, almost filling large sections of the hillside, but often leaving space for a few cultivated terraces in between them. One settlement is, bizarrely, a massive billboard, with dozens of identical homes all painted bright yellow and emblazoned with the logo of a cement company. We are nonplussed to drive past a needle factory – why would you site factory here, of all places? At least the finished product is small and therefore easy to transport, I suppose.

The weather forecast for the next two days is not good. It suggests it will rain from lunchtime onwards, and that the cloud and mist will be more or less continuous. We consider getting up early to make the most of
Ooty from Doddabetta peak
the dry weather, but opt to lie in instead and set off at 9am. But it is sunny as we climb up to Ooty and there is more of a view than we had yesterday. Not that you can take a good photo – it’s not practical to ask Mr Hussain to stop the car, given the narrow road, endless bends and continuous traffic, and most of the shots we take form the moving car feature concrete barriers, trees, electricity cables and other obstructions to the view.

First stop in Ooty is, in fact outside the town. Doddabetta Peak is billed as having great views over the town, and the guidebook says you can walk to the top of the peak. David is pleased he has had the foresight to bring his trekking poles, anticipating a stiff climb to the peak. But this is India, and local tourists don’t expect to have to walk that far. We drive to the top of the peak, and leave Mr Hussain to find a parking space in a heaving car park. A two minute walk gets us to the ticket office, where the fee is a modest 5 rupees per person and
Ooty botanical gardens
10 per camera. There is a small paved area, with a coffee shop and some stalls selling herbal remedies, and an incongruous children’s playground. It takes less than 30 seconds to reach the ‘peak’. In fact, we are grateful there is not far to walk. The peak is at 2600 metres elevation and we are both gasping and headachy in the thin air. It is mercifully sunny, which means that Sara’s failure to put the sweaters in the bag does not matter as it’s a very pleasant temperature. Many of our fellow tourists clearly do not feel the same way, and are sporting woolly hats that do up under the chin and even, in one case, a hotel towel draped over the shoulders.

Next stop is the botanical gardens, created in 1847 by the Marquis of Tweesdale who brought in a botanist from Kew, Mr McIver, to lay the place out. We spend a pleasant hour walking – slowly – through the gardens. This is much more what we had expected. The trees are mostly not labelled, but the crowds thin out once we walk more than 5 minutes, and it then becomes a very peaceful place. The book
Not exactly Kew
tells us the must-see highlight is the fern house, modelled on Kew. Well, maybe, but it is on an altogether smaller scale, more like a biggish greenhouse, and lacks any of the giant varieties that we enjoy when we go to Kew.

Back to Coonoor, and we see the toy train pulling in to the station just as we drive past. We originally planned to take the train up to Ooty, but then realised that a) you cannot pre-book, and need to queue up at 5am on the day to buy a ticket, b) the gradient to Ooty is too steep for the steam engines, so they use a diesel engine instead – much less fun and c) it’s very useful to have the car once in Ooty. We stop to take photos. The engine seems already to have been de-coupled by the time we make it to the platform, but Sara points out the loco shed and suggests we visit. ‘How do we get there?’ asks David. ‘Walk along the tracks like you see everyone doing at all Indian stations’ replies Sara. So we do, and get a warm welcome from the engineers hard at work in the
Choo choos
shed. Three of them are in the pit, replacing a wheel, covered in engine oil. Sara, trouser legs rolled up to keep them clear of the oil and grime that covers the floor, locates the only remaining coal-fired steam engine, much to David’s excitement. It will come as no surprise to learn that we take far too many photos. David has not been in a working steam shed since about 1965.......



Back to the hotel for a late lunch in the garden outside our room. Our timing has been perfect. We hear the roll of thunder soon after we sit down, and the rain starts half an hour later. For a while, we stay outside, sheltered by the table umbrella – as we are British a bit of rain is no impediment - but eventually it gets cold and we retire to our room.

Jedna z bran
Geo: 9.91854, 78.1102

Ráno probíhá snídaně v místní ""britské pekárně"". Do evropské pekárny to má hooooodně daleko, ale je to asi jediné espresso kafe ve městě. Vzhledem k tomu, že máme oba dost místní pálivé stravy, s nadšením si dáváme sandwich s vaječnou omeletou, sýrem a rajčetem. Po snídani se vydáváme k největší místní atrakci, hinduistický chrám Sri Meenakshi. Chrám se čtvercovou základnou a čtyřma vstupníma branama, které jsou rozmístěny dle světových stran, o rozloze 15 akrů. Trochu pruda je, že hlavní části chrámu, jehož útroby se nacházejí z větší časti pod zemí, jsou přístupny pouze hindu nebo za další vstupní poplatek. Tomuto odoláváme a procházíme jen volně přístupné části. Zajímavostí je, že chrám je věnován bohyni Meenakshi, která se narodila se třema prsama a sudbou, že to prostřední se rozplyne až potká svého muže. Takže když potkala Shivu, přišla o prs a on chudák o výjimečný přírodní úkaz 😉. Po prohlídce chrámu si dáváme oběd v nejlepší místní restauraci, tedy dle Lonely Planet. Žádná hitparáda, ale aspoň sevírují špagety a my se tak můžeme opět obejít bez místní stravy. Vzhledem k nehoráznému vedru, únavě a faktu, že v tomhle městě už nic víc k vidění není, se vracíme na pokoj k
Jedna potajmu pořízená fotka v útrobách chrámu
odpočinku. Na večeři se vracíme opět do nej restaurace, kde si tentokrát dáváme krásně vychlazené pivečko a dvě dosi, místní ale snesitelně pálivé jídlo. Unaveni po pivečku a nepříjemně parném dni uleháme k odpočinku...

chaos on the road to Coonoor
Another cold morning and we are up early in Kodaikanal, ready to set off to Coonoor, a long drive in prospect. The previous evening we have had a club sandwich, unable to face another Indian meal after the burningly spiced thali served to us for lunch. Seems like chef had not served a club sandwich before. He had not done badly, but had not toasted the bread. He appeared at our table, head wobbling from side to side in excited expectancy. “How was club sandwich flavour good?” he asks. Such a sweet man, we just reply “yes, delicious, very nice”, and off he goes beaming with pride after first taking our photo.

Off we go from Kodaikanal. We trek along the side of the Ghats, uphill and downhill. The road surface is awful, potholes with the occasional bit of tarmac. The mist boils up over the edge of the roadway, driven by the warmer air in the valley below. At times there is a break in the mist and one can see the hillside plunging precipitately towards the valley floor below. Sometimes the drop is apparently 3000 or 4000ft. Some of the road side barriers could be a little better,
Coonoor
indeed in some places it would be nice if there were any at all.

Eventually the road plunges down a series of 14 numbered hairpins to the plains below. The temperature rises sharply. We drive through vast expanses of coconut groves, sometimes with banana plants interspersed. Sugar cane, rice and mangoes are also seen growing here. We see signs warning of “elephants crossing” but sadly see none. Along the roadside are clusters of huts made from palm leaves and woven palm matting that we surmise must be the houses of the plantation workers. Eventually the land becomes less fertile and we proceed through more scrubby countryside.

Everywhere we have been in Tamil Nadu, every other billboard and wall has been plastered by posters featuring a lady Tamil Nadu politician. There roads are no exception. We assume there is a state election pending. We have taken a hearty dislike to the smug overweight woman and her gang of cronies, some 30 or so of whom are pictured alongside her. They all look shifty or dishonest or smug. No idea who they are but we don’t like them. The only other people who seem to be campaigning are the communist
sunset from Conoor hotel
party of India. The red hammer and sickle makes a nice change when we see their flags flying.

We pass for mile upon mile through an endless landscape of wind turbines covering much less fertile farmland. David begins to mutter about the economic illiteracy of building and operating these monstrosities, and that they are probably built with EU grant money and/or British foreign aid. Humph humph he goes. Eventually they peter out and we witness a bizarre sight in a village where we stop to ask for directions. As the driver is speaking to one of the locals, three men, clad in yellow, walk past. One of them is carrying something that is shaped like a tuba but is not a musical instrument. It is emitting smoke from the open end, the second man is banging the hell out of a big drum he is carrying, and the third is chanting. No idea what that was about....religious observance?



We spend an age crossing the grim city of Coimbatore before taking the road up to Coonoor. The traffic thickens immediately on the narrow road, in both directions. Insanity on the road is displayed by many drivers. We
what happens when you ignore the drive safely signs
know it is dangerous as Mr Hussain is keeping his seat belt on (like most Indian drivers he only wears it when he sees a policeman up ahead). We see three crashes in about ten miles. The rain is coming down. The town when we arrive in a chaotic mess......and then up a hillside road, adjacent to All Saints Church, an Anglican church that could be in England except that it is painted yellow, we arrive at the oasis of calm that is the Gateway Hotel. Originally called the Hampton Manor it was built around 1857. It went through ownership by various colourful characters until it was eventually turned into a hotel. It retains the quirky charm you would expect of such a place, with the reassuring hand of the Taj group to now keeping it running smoothly.

Plantáže všude kolem
Geo: 9.91854, 78.1102

Ráno se probouzíme kolem osmé čekajíc na snídani a překvapivě se o půl deváté nic neděje. Pospáváme tedy ještě a čekáme co se stane. Okolo půl desáté bušení na dveře a za nimi pan domácí se snídaní, která je dnes obzvlášť bohatá. Po jídle chvili vegetíme, balíme a vyrážíme na cestu. Nejdřív tukem na křižovatku, kde okamžitě nasedáme na bus do Munnaru, kde okamžitě nasedáme na bus do Theni. Cesta je to nádhernś, protože vede přes hory a všude kokem jsou jen čajové plantáže, fakt úžasné. Jem řidič je idiot, kterýmu by měli sebrat papíry, pokud ovšem nějaké má. Cesta je jen brzda plyn a prudké točení volantem. Upřimně, bylo celkem obtížné udržet snídani a chai, který jsme si dali před cestou. Nakonec vše zůstalo kde mělo a my byli po třech hodinách utrpení na místě. Bus opět okamžitě navazuje. My si ho však necháváme ujet a jdeme se naobědvat do místní restaurace. Já si dávám místní verzi thali a Yan dosa. Oboje moc dobré. Dokonce máme i velice příjemného vrchního, který chudák neustále běhá a přidává, evidentně čekajic nějaké to dýško ... Naivka, neví, že narazil na dvě socky, který mu nedají nic 😉... Nakonec ani nenadával a

my vyrážíme na bus, který je opět zrovna připraven k odjezdu. Parádička. Cesta je naštěstí rovná jen nám začalo pěěkně pršet, což je u busu bez oken a dveří trochu nepříjemné. Naštěstí to byl jen několikaminutivý slejvák a tak ani nejsme moc mokří. Za necelé dvě hoďky jsme v Madurai. Z nádraží se přesouváme místním busem do centra, kde nacházíme po chvilce ptaní ubytko. Rychlá večeře v protějši restauraci a hurá do peřin...

The non view from Coaker's walk
The downside of sleeping in a tent – even one with a heater- becomes rapidly clear. It is very cold and the bathroom, lacking any heating, is positively freezing. We sleep exceedingly badly. In part, this is due to the altitude. It comes back to us how badly we used to sleep on the first night skiing in Colorado. In part, it is due to the chicken Chettinad we ate at dinner, which burns its way slowly through our guts. Both of us fear that after 2 weeks away, our luck has run out and we are about to get ill, but mercifully this turns out not to be the case. The animals don’t help either. All night dogs can be heard barking furiously, as if repelling invaders or lining up in pitched battle. When they fall into an exhausted slumber, the cockerel and the pigeons start up. By 7am we admit further sleep is impossible.

As it is far too cold to consider showering, we dress and go to breakfast. This does not go well. We ask for filter coffee. Two cups of white coffee arrive, so Sara asks for a black cup. It eventually arrives, complete with
Oxfam rejects
a jug of hot milk. Meanwhile, we had ordered eggs and toast. The toast and Sara’s omelette arrive fairly quickly, but David’s boiled eggs will, we are told, take 15 minutes. Well, we say to ourselves, it does take longer to boil an egg at altitude. 15 minutes pass. ‘Just 15 minutes more, sir’. It’s like the old joke about London buses – you wait 30 minutes then three arrive all at once. In this case, shelled and sitting in a bowl of hot water.

As we contemplate the eggs, the manager appears to tell us that there is a problem with our car. Apparently it would not start this morning. He tells us this because the diesel has frozen in the cold. Even Sara, with her limited knowledge of the workings of the internal combustion engine, knows that this sounds implausible. In any event, our 9am start is pushed back to 10.30. We enjoy the only sun of the day and sit in the garden, both feeling a little under par. At 10.30 we find Mr Hussain fitting a new battery into the car. Seemingly this is not the only problem, but the car will at least start,
David enjoying the views of the lake
so he drives us to the start of Croker’s Walk and says he will pick us up in an hour. We had understood this to be a walk of about an hour, offering stunning views of the valley below. The first and most evident problem is that the valley is filled with mist, which swirls up and across the path. There is no view whatsoever. The second snag is that the walk turns out to take under 15 minutes. Even allowing for walking back slowly, inspecting all the stalls strung out along the route, we face a long wait for Mr Hussain. The stalls cater for every eventuality. You can buy cold drinks, ice cream (are you feeling lucky, punk?) or, strangely, carrots with their greenery still attached. These seem to be the choice of the day judging by the number of people who pass us munching on a carrot. You can get a cushion (why??), new pair of sandals, an umbrella in case it rains, or a sweater/jacket. The latter are clearly second hand. We are reminded of a trip years ago to Vietnam when our guide told us that distributors bought large consignments of clothes that charity shops could not sell (or else that were fraudulently obtained from door to door collections) then sold them on at a profit in Asia. This looks similar. You can also get your photo taken for 50 rupees. David toys with the ideal of offering to do it for 40 rupees until Sara points out he has no way of printing the photos. Mercifully Mr Hussain reappears early. The car is still not full fixed, so he drops us by the lake and says he will pick us up in an hour. The lake is billed as the most scenic spot in town. Really? The most interesting aspect of our walk is peering in at the huge, expensive villas that line the lake shore, many with heavy security.

Call us slow learners, but after lunch we opt to go on the valley tour drive. First stop is a ‘walk’ in the woods. A few vendors are packing up their wares, harassed at every step by a group of aggressive macaque monkeys. We set forth into the wood, which is in fact a forestry department plantation of tall, spindly uninteresting trees. Judging by our fellow visitors, the walk consists of going 50 yards into the wood, taking photos of each other and leaving. We follow their lead, minus the photos. After this, the drive descends into farce. The mist thickens until we can barely see the road ahead. The temperature drops ten degrees and there is a touch of rain in the mist. The highlights of the drive are a series of viewpoints, none of which is visible. By the time we have finished, even Mr Hussain is laughing along with us.



There is nothing else to visit, and it is really rather chilly to sit in the garden. We retreat to our tent and turn the heater on. Every long trip has one bad day, and hopefully this is it for this trip.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Kodaikanal
February 25th 2015
Published: February 25th 2015


Western Ghats
Kodaikanal clings to the hillside high in the Western Ghats. Once a colonial hill station, it now sprouts an ever growing spread of modern buildings – houses, hotels and shops. But there is still charm and beauty to be found.

Kodaikanal marks the start of the second half of our holiday. The first half was the sea, heat and temples, the second will be cooler with hills, plantations and animals. The journey from Madurai takes three hours, with the best road of the holiday so far giving way to narrow winding roads as we make our way up into the hills. Our average speed drops to 30kph. Mr Hussain ignores the many signs exhorting drivers not to overtake on the bend, which is probably just as well since there is no bend free section for 80 kilometres. Added to the consequent hazard of finding a vehicle coming in the other direction (mitigated by low speed and copious use of the horn) is the risk of not slowing down in time to avoid the sections where a landslide has caused one side of the road to drop off down the cliff. The arid landscape of the plain is replaced by thin
The honeymoon suite
stands of trees, with an occasional spectacular view over two or more ranges of hazy hills. We wind endlessly upwards, with no obvious sense of direction, passing numerous Catholic and Lutheran foundations, including a Carmelite monastery.

Kodaikanal was “discovered” in 1821 by one of our Plucky Chaps called Lt. Ward who was looking for somewhere for the colonial administrators and foreign missionaries in Madurai to spend the summer, as they were dropping like flies from the heat and pestilence if they stay down in the plains. Once in town, we face the usual challenge of finding our hotel. It is small and nobody seems to have heard of it. But eventually we find a discreet sign next to a closed gate. We’ve arrived. The Fern Creek is a charming, quiet place in the most literal sense of the word. Slightly out of town, it has just seven tented rooms scattered about a peaceful hillside garden. We are invited into the main building to check in and offered tea. This turns out to be exceedingly strong, with milk – not exactly how either of us likes it. We sip tentatively under the steady attentive gaze of three staff members standing
Cement carriers
to attention. Either they are incredibly attentive or Europeans are something of a rarity. We suggest going to our room. ‘No, no, you drink tea first’. It is hot and we swallow hard. Sara spills half of hers. We are both desperately suppressing our giggles by now. Eventually we are led off down a path through the garden which culminates in the honeymoon suite (or tent). We enter. It is sepulchrally dark and stiflingly hot, which seems odd as Kodaikanal is at nearly 2000 meters and is a lot cooler as a result. Then we realise the gas fire is turned on. Our host seems surprised when we turn it off. Darkness apart, the room/tent is spacious and comfortable and the bathroom actually looks more modern than the previous hotel. It has curtains draped from the ridge of the tent, and a bed with four posts but nothing attached to them.

Lunch is speedily cooked for us. The waiter (who is probably also the cook) hovers over us, feeling it his duty not to let us ever serve ourselves. As ever, we are offered more of everything, despite the first serving having been generous.

We ask for advice
It's bright in the tent......
on what to visit, and are presented with a list of places which seem to be grouped into small tours. We decide to opt for the ‘trekking tour’ and ask them to give Mr Hussain directions. The journey is an interesting one as none of us have a clue where we are going. The road gets narrower and narrower. At one point it is being repaired, and the gap that is left looks to be roughly half the width of our Innova. But with the miraculous ‘make me smaller’ button that all Indian vehicles seem to be equipped with, we get round it somehow. Sara is grateful that she is sitting in the car on the inside of the bend and not the side with the sheer drop. Eventually, we draw up alongside some stalls selling soft drinks. ‘Walk there’ gestures Mr Hussain. Having read that the walk to the Dolphin Nose rock is a steep 1km, and David’s ankle being unstable, we have brought out our walking poles. The first people we pass are two backpackers, wearing shorts and T-shirts, heavily tattooed and with nose rings. We, by contrast, are sporting trekking trousers, long sleeved shirts, hats and walking
Kodaikanal from afar
poles, with rucksack (Hannah and James will recognise our stylish appearance). Probably being stoned they at least have the grace not to laugh at us, which is more than can be said for the majority of the Indians we meet on our walk. Some smirk, others burst into outright laughter, pointing as they do so. But we are infused with the spirit of John Bull and the Raj so we don’t care. Besides, the path is not only steep but treacherous, with sections of rock outcrops and others thick with gnarled tree roots, and we are grateful for the poles as we pick our way cautiously down. The path is littered with discarded snack packets and broken and discarded chappals, probably the stupidest footwear to have on your feet on this path. At one point we have to stand aside to let a dozen or more donkeys past. They are all laden down with bags of cement, but move much faster and more sure footedly than we do. The walk is not quite the commune with nature we were expecting, as there is a makeshift stall selling soft drinks every hundred yards. Since we only meet about six other tourists
Not on the path please
on the path, it’s hard to see how any of these stalls make money. As we pass one of these stalls, a woman emerges and shrieks with laughter. We turn around and she is mimicking a person walking with poles, swinging her arms back and forth and lumbering her body from side to side and puffing for breath. Actually very amusing but most disrespectful of the former rulers of the Empire.

We reach the Dolphin's Nose. A rocky outcrop with a drop of about 2000m down to the valley floor below. The walk is worth it, as we are rewarded with sweeping views of the hills at the end. Then it is time to retrace our steps, this time uphill – harder work on the lungs but easier walking. There is low growling coming from somewhere. Are we about to meet a leopard? Alas no, it is just a troop of macaques in the trees, clearly warning the interlopers passing through their patch. We pass a stall we had noticed before that has a sign saying 'Shalom' and 'kosher food'. Hippies in India these days all seem to be Israelis (why?) and they have clearly made it to Kodaikanal.
Why are they laughing at me


We return to the hotel where we are immediately offered more tea. We accept gracefully and adjourn to our tent. Having opened the ‘windows’ to let some light in, it now feels distinctly cool, so we close up the flaps and turn the fire back on. Tea arrives. There is a flask, with cups, teabags, sugar and slices of lime. Sara puts a teabag into a cup and starts to pour, only to find the flask contains tea not hot water. What, then, are the tea bags for? We sit on our tiny balcony and read. The sound of the birds is pleasingly louder than that the faint murmur of distant vehicles, punctuated only by the sound of things dropping off the trees and landing on our awning. The smell of wood smoke suffuses the air. Soon the light will go and we’ll need to move inside. We are glad that we brought a pair of clip-on reading lamps, as we’ll need them tonight.



A young man appears five minutes later to ask if we want anything. We cannot think of anything but then he asks if we would like some French fries and coffee? Not what we were wanting until he mentioned it but yes please! So we scoff that down at about 6pm. Not exactly high tea, but perfect as we sit in front of the gas fire in the gloom.

Yet another gopuram, Thirupparankundram temple
It is the perfect temperature at about 7am when we breakfast but unfortunately it does not stay like that for long. The restaurant manager tells us that summer has arrived early this year. This seems to happen every year we go to India....

The sweepers (who all belong to one of the lowest castes) are busy around the hotel going about their endless task of sweeping dead leaves from one place to another. The keeper of the little Shiva shrine has already put the idol's new clothes on for the day and given him a new garland.

As we drive out of the hotel we see a 40 seater coach about to load up its English tour party and take them off to their next destination. Never in one place long enough to see anything properly, no control over where you go or how long you spend anywhere and enforced visits to the ‘craft workshops’ where the tour guide gets a special commission. And apparently a requirement for the men all to wear non-branded polo shirts tucked into too short shorts and belted tightly, with black socks and sandals. A ghastly way to go on holiday.

We set
Queueing for the sanctum, if you want to save 50 rupees
off in due course to visit the Thirupparankundram Murugan Temple, which is a short distance out of town. Mr. Hussein does not let us leave the car until he had delivered his “Madurai number one cheating peoples in India” warning. This temple is dedicated to Lord Murugan (Shiva's son, apparently). The first hustler appears as soon as we enter the temple. “Camera fee 100 rupees each”. “No there isn’t, there is no sign”. “Yes is give me money”. “No”. “Come with me get ticket”. “No, get lost”. Eventually he gets bored and wanders off. In fact he was trying to con us into buying a special prayer ticket.....or just robbing us, who knows.

This temple existed from at least the 6th century. The outer precincts of the temple are a bazaar – gaudy trinkets, toys, offering to the gods, all for sale. It is a favourite temple of the Tamils and very crowded. The temple interior is a huge rectangular chamber carved out of the hill, with side chambers housing various deities approached via narrow passages. Rather than joining the free queue which snakes away up steel bar line passages, we pay our 50 rupees and join the express
Study of scooters
queue to the inner sanctum. Seems like here you can become a temporary Hindu and get let in to the sanctum. The sanctum itself is pretty impressive; five (or seven?) separate chambers housing Shiva, Vishnu etc, each attended by Brahmin priests, lit by flickering candlelight, while at the front one Brahmin gives the blessings while in the back three or four others are busy doing whatever Brahmin priests do. Everywhere around there are subsidiary idols, carved pillars, with devotees prostrating themselves, offering bananas, coconuts, milk and so on.

We leave the temple and for some reason forego the opportunity to walk to the top of the baking bare hill behind the temple to visit a small Muslim shrine. Even serious site viewers have their limits.

Unfortunately now David needs a wee. We have smelt the only place in town on the way to the temple. “You can do it”, Sara assures him. David approaches with trepidation (at times like this I envy James' ability to go ten hours without needing a toilet). I bind my cotton scarf twice around my mouth and nose. The stench rises like a miasma from hell. The urinal has tiled walls about three
Temple ghee lamps
feet high. There is one step in, then another tiled step where you have to take up position to do the needful. The upper step is covered in filthy rag rugs soaked in piss. Oh Lord please do not allow me to slip over. Holding my breath I get on with it. Please do not allow my sunglasses to fall off my face or they will be lost for all eternity. I try not to look at the urinal, or at the fetid green yellow stuff at the bottom of it. Oh no, the sink hole is blocked! Fortunately I am finished. Now I find my flip flops are sticking to the matting. What if they come off my feet?? I curl my toes to grasp the sandals and step back into thin air to step down. Footwear stays on and I do not stumble. I stagger out and gratefully suck in a lungful of delicious diesel fume laden dusty air. I have survived! Sara congratulates me and declines to use the ladies' equivalent.

Sara meanwhile has been checking out the array of motorbikes and scooters. It feels as if everyone has either a bicycle (always of the ‘sit
Hanuman the monkey god, Aligarh temple
up and beg’) variety or a motorbike/scooter. The ultimate status symbol is a Royal Enfield motorbike, now made solely in India. But these are few and far between. Honda seem to have cornered the market, and the girls all opt for a pink ‘Scooty’ model. Certainly in Madurai you get places much faster on two wheels than four, weaving in and out of the traffic in what should be death-defying manoeuvres but in fact often looks almost languid. Until you get knocked off......

On to the last temple, the Koodal Aligarh temple, this one having Vishu as its “presiding deity” as they call it. The man at the “free chapel stand” demands money for his free service. We go in. “Camera fee 100 rupees”. Oh just get lost, not again......it is an interesting temple, but we may have reached our temple limit now. “Camera fee” squeals a toothless crone with no apparent relationship to the temple when Sara raises her lens. It's all a bit much, Mr. Hussein was right all along, “Madurai people number one cheating in India”.

We abandon cultural activities and ask Mr Hussain to take us to Big Bazaar, one of a chain of
Carving, Koodal Aligarh temple
small department stores. He clearly thinks this is one of the more sensible suggestions we have made. Sara buys some lightweight cotton trousers for £3, and we stock up on fruit, soft drinks and crisps. The urge to buy more packs of spices is almost overwhelming, but Sara reminds herself that she checked the cupboards before leaving home and we really do not need any more. We buy a couple of jars of pickle in compensation, and return to the hotel.

Tomorrow we are off to the hills – cooler weather and no more temples for a while.

Meenakshi temple gopuram Madurai
Our first full day in Madurai, a city nearly as old as human civilisation, and we are almost “templed out”, which is a little unfortunate as we are in one of the great temple cities of India. We had visions of taking the opportunity of strolling around peaceful and historic byways, but the stinking heat and noise of the city has put paid to this. We go off to the Meenakshi Amman temple, “the high point of Dravidian temple architecture”. Mr Hussain gives us a short avuncular lecture before we leave the car. “Madurai number one cheating city in India. Very bad place many thieves steal camera wallet watch everything many beggars you no give money. Pay money to go in only see on notice 50 rupees only OK?” Suitably chastened we set off. David hobbles along on his gammy left ankle, swatting away beggars and hawkers. An enthusiastic young man wielding a large, professional video camera, with accompanying sound man, breaks off filming a wedding party proceeding down the street, to their slight bemusement. “Excuse me sir, what is your camera very nice?” “Canon 5D mark II, with the 17-40mm wide angle L lens today.” “Sir how much in your
wedding party at temple
country?” “About £2500”, “Aiyahh” he bubbles excitedly to the sound man, and returns to his wedding filming.

A problem. Soldiers are on guard outside the temple, as this is a religiously significant temple thought to be potentially at risk of attack by Islamists, and inter alia they are enforcing the no cameras inside rule. Unlike the usual no photography rule, you cannot take the camera inside. “You leave in luggage check”. This comprises some open lockers with keys hanging out. The keys are not used and goods are placed inside and not locked up. “Can you lock and take the key?” “No we look after very safe”. Yeah right, we are going to leave two cameras worth about four grand hanging out of that locker. So back to the car to find Mr Hussain who quite reasonably has gone off for some tea. Oh dear. It is about 35C and we need some shade to wait so we find a urine smelling park full of pilgrims and vagrants and a low stone wall to sit on. Note to self, wash these trousers when back at the hotel.

After about half an hour we go back to the car
Madurai palace courtyard
and find him, and leave the cameras with him. Back to the temple, pay our 50 rupees each. What an amazing place! There are 12 gopurams, all encrusted with a staggering array of gods, goddesses, demons and heroes, all richly painted, and all different. The four main gopurams are massive. Most of the existing temple was built during the 17th century by the Nayak kings, but its origins go back 2000 years. The temple is dedicated to the triple-breasted goddess Meenakshi (a form of Parvati) with a sanctum for her consort, Sudareshwarar (Shiva). According to legend, Meenakshi was born with three breasts and the prophecy that her superfluous breast would melt away when she met her husband. The event came to pass when she met Shiva and took her place as his consort.



Inside we find the Thousand Pillar Hall. This is now an art museum where there is a Shiva shrine with a large bronze Nataraja at the end of a corridor of beautifully carved stone pillars (some of the best we have seen in India), plus many bronzes into whose display cabinets people have stuffed their business cards and photos to seek blessings and good
In search of the perfect picture
luck. Further into the temple is a Nandi shrine surrounded by more beautifully carved columns and the temple tree – this one of solid gold, none of that red painted stone rubbish we saw yesterday. Needless to say the priceless treasures in the main Shiva shrine and the main Meenakshi shrine are denied us……as yes, only Hindus can enter. In many parts of India 50 rupees to the Brahmin doorkeeper would get you 5 minutes of temporary conversion to Hinduism allowing you to enter, but not in Tamil Nadu, they are serious about their shrines here.



There is a 50 meter square tank, the Golden Lotus Pond, within the temple precincts. In ancient times, the sangam, an assembly of Tamil poets, met there to judge the merits of new poems. They threw the manuscripts into the pool, and those that sank were judged inferior while those that floated were worthy of praise. Seems a pretty stupid way of judging a competition but that's how they did it!

Back to the car, which by now has heated up in the sun to well over 40 degrees. We crawl through the traffic to the Thirumalai Nayak palace which
Madurai palace ceiling cupola
was built in 1636 by the ruler whose name it bears. Built in Indo Saracenic style, what is left is impressive if somewhat run down. All that remains is the courtyard, main hall and the dancing hall, all stuccoed and surrounded by massive pillars. Unfortunately the king's grandson demolished most of the original palace and nicked the jewels and woodcarvings to build his own palace. Then as now, Indians can be careless about preserving their heritage. What is now left is largely thanks to Lord Napier, the then Governor of Madras, who partially restored the palace in the late 1860s. Good chap Lord Napier. And enough sightseeing for today.

Ilayathagudi temple, dancer
Today we must leave our hotel and move on to Madurai. But before leaving Chettinad we are urged to visit two of the Chettinad clan temples. If you are a Chettiar, wherever in the world you are born, you belong to one of nine Chettiar clan temples - a bit like Scottish clans I suppose, though they do not have temples and Indians do not wear kilts ......some of the temples are better endowed than others, depending on the wealth of its members. First off we visit the Ilayathagudi temple, which is a modest establishment, with the usual four gopurams and an inner shrine. A bored Brahmin engages us in conversation, seemingly just so he can practise his English, not to extort a temple donation. There is hardly a soul around. Each of these Chettiar temples has a red pillar inside the entrance to the temple proper, which apparently is the temple “tree” which shows that the temple is complete and open for business, so to speak. You learn something every day.

On then to the Karpaka Vinayakar temple, a much grander affair, complete with beggars who miraculously appear with extended hands when they see the only white faces present.
temple floor painting
The place is heaving – it is Sunday morning and everyone has come to offer prayers and make donations. A rat scurries busily around the entrance looking for food – Sara tries to convince herself it is a mouse, but fails.

Inside the temple many people are throwing themselves down and prostrating themselves in one particular direction, not towards any of the obvious shrines, which is a bit confusing. There is a railed walkway leading towards the inner sanctum; we expect to be turned away, not being Hindus. However we are able to bypass the long line of devotees and ascend a raised platform to the right of them, from where we can see the gold plated Ganesh in the sanctum, made in the 2nd century. David misses his step off the platform, causing much amusement to the women queuing alongside. There are many devotees with shaved heads coated in sandalwood paste. A strange observance.....

Sights seen, it’s back to the Toyota and time to drive to Madurai. The first hour of the journey is through open countryside and is as restful as any road in India can be. Small sights stick in the mind: the little girl
truly bizarre temple floor painting
bowling a lorry tyre along with a stick, the scarecrow incongruously pinned to the wall of a part-built house (why?), the farmer with his goats disappearing out of view down a trail between two lines of trees, the occasional peasant indulging in what in India is referred to as “open defecation” at the roadside. The countryside is arid and we pass a number of dried up paddy fields that have gone to ruin. The monsoon has failed for three consecutive years round here, putting huge pressure on the farmers and causing rice prices to shoot up. There are lines of palm trees with tall trunks and leaves that form the shape of a small ball at the top, looking like giant allium plants. We go through small villages where the road is lined by tiny shacks selling food and drink or offering bicycle and motorbike repairs. The landscape is flat, but every now and then is broken up by large sandstone outcrops. Many of these are being quarried, and resemble big Swiss rolls being cut up slice by slice. Huge slabs of rock, a couple of metres on each side, lie piled up in rows along the roadside. It feels
Temple gopuram
like a very graphic illustration of the fact that natural resources, once used, cannot be replaced.

Gradually the countryside gives way to little box like houses as we approach Madurai. Mr Hussain’s determination to check our route requires exceptional determination when driving along a double carriageway with no passers by. He winds down his window, draws level with a car heading in the same direction and shouts out his request for guidance. He then pulls up on the side of the road, and the passing vehicle does the same in order to help out. Can’t see it working on the M1! All of a sudden he is driving much faster and somewhat more recklessly than usual. This can only partly be accounted for by the better road. We muse on this, then remember he is going to stay with his sister while in Madurai, and realise that for once he has an incentive to get somewhere promptly.

The traffic in Madurai is as bad as every other big Indian city. It may have been continually inhabited for over 4000 years but it looks like any metropolis – billboards, new apartment blocks, private hospitals, squalor, dust, rubbish on the
Karpaka Vinayakar temple
side of the road, rundown streets, cattle wandering where they please......there is no sense of history in an Indian city, no architecture of merit, apart from the temples or the occasional palace.

There are no road names or signs to provide any guidance on where to go, so we stop innumerable times for directions before finally pulling in to our hotel. It is perfectly pleasant, but suffers from the sense of faded glory we have seen so many times before. It was once the Madurai Club when Our Chaps were in charge here, and it looks like it could do with new management and some new paint. Still, it is something of a haven from the hustle outside. We settle down on the balcony to have a drink and look up where we will visit over the next two days. Our planning has failed us somewhat, as there is arguably only really one day’s worth to see in town, but we are here for two days. It takes an hour to persuade the hotel that their internet is down, but eventually the problem is sorted. We plan our stay, read our books and manage to find Star Sports 2 which is showing English football, thus allowing David to watch Everton. This means we need to eat early as the match starts at 7.35 our time. We get to the coffee shop at 6.15 and order three simple dishes. 50 minutes later, still no food despite multiple requests. Both of us crack – badly. We ignore the golden rule of travelling in Asia, that there is no point in making a fuss, and demand to see the manager. The food then arrives (and is, in fact, very tasty) and the manager agrees not to charge us for it. Result. David promptly and deftly orders two puddings on the back of this offer, which we have delivered to the room. Everton then produce a dire performance, but manage to scrape a draw. The Germans next door probably learned some new vocabulary though if they were listening through the wall.

Temple guardians
Armed with a list of places to see and some directions from the hotel, we set off to explore Chettinad. The first stop is a temple with rows of terracotta horses guarding the entrance. It sounds large and likely to be full of tourists. We progress ever further off the beaten track, with Mr Hussain stopping for directions every few minutes. Finally we reach the right village, but there is no sign of a temple. We ask again. Further down the road comes the answer. Once out of the village, we reach a deserted clearing in the scrubland with a temple-like gateway. Can this really be the right place? We get out of the car and find that the road leading beyond the gate is indeed lined with terracotta horses. Not the immaculately carved variety found in Xian next to the warriors, but cruder versions, some painted and some plain, some broken and some whole, about 3 or 4 feet high. Hundreds of them, side by side. The painted ones have lively expressions and every one is different. Some have garlands or twigs tied to their ears and appear almost pagan. The place has a magical, almost spooky charm. We amble
Well, hello
slowly down the road, taking far too many pictures. Ahead looms the backside of a lifesize terracotta elephant with a small carved person clinging on to its bum. At this point we meet an old man who is busy brushing the sand floor with a broom who gestures at us to remove our sandals as we are now entering the temple precinct. We obey, and keep walking down the road. Eventually, we reach a large tree, beneath which are a row of small garlanded figures of gods, each one dressed, with a few lit lamps in front of them and what looks like shards of pottery piled up behind. This is very unusual as it is the first time we have seen idols outside – they are always in a shrine of some sort. We are invited to light a lamp and have our faces painted with red and white, but decline. It dawns on us that there is no temple building. We later learn that these Ayyanar temples (Ayyanar being the deity) were built outside villages and the horses are there to scare away the demons. The fierce imagery is part of the cult and devotees offer new terracotta
Chettiar mansion, main hall
horses, tridents and spears to the temple, though in distant times sacrifice of real animals was involved. Ayyanar is a very powerful God who is worshipped only by lower caste, village people, and it is very much concentrated in southern Tamil Nadu.

The next stop is one of the Chettiar mansions. Once more, we drive through a dry, red dust landscape with a scattering of thorn bushes and coconut trees, seeing fewer people than all holiday. Eventually we reach the right village. The house we are due to visit is easy to spot, being infinitely grander than anywhere else around. It appears to be locked up, but as we approach the gate, a woman approaches and lets us in. She shows us round, pointing out the elaborately carved and painted ceilings made from Burmese teak, the wall tiles from Japan and the mirrors from Belgium. The house follows the same design as our hotel, with a series of grand halls. It is well preserved but eerily empty until we reach the kitchen quarters where the staff seem to live.

As we drive on, we reach yet another village, Kanadukathan, this one full of old mansions. Sadly most of
Another restored mansion
them are gradually decaying through neglect and lack of funds, even though some are still occupied. From one decrepit pile belts out Beethoven's Ode to Joy (why?). It is an extraordinary place, almost a ghost town, evoking a bygone age, with no tourists and few inhabitants to be seen.

Last stop is a slightly more modest mansion bought by two French architects who spent a year restoring it and turning it into a beautiful hotel. They care passionately about preserving the remaining mansions in the area, and have been battling to persuade the Indian government to apply for Unesco World Heritage status for the area. Inevitably their efforts have been thwarted at every turn. Even when they persuade a local official of the merits of their case, central government lacks the interest or the desire to provide any funding. It seems such a shame, when what they have done with their own hotel, Saratha Villas, shows how such renovation can bring both short term construction work and long term employment and tourist dollars to the region. But hey this is India.



We get back to the hotel in time for a light lunch and an afternoon
Chettiar mansion
relaxing on our balcony. The peace is temporarily shattered by the arrival of a French tour party, who check in, sit by the pool chatting noisily, smoking and swimming. But fortunately they seem to go off for an afternoon excursion, leaving the hotel to just us and the couple in the room next door. As the sun starts to set, we stroll round the village, finding yet more mansions in various states of repair and disrepair.

Story of our holday
The Sriraganatha temple at Trichy (all these Tamil towns beginning with the letter T gets a little confusing) is supposedly the largest Hindu temple in the world. It is also part town and part temple, there are seven rings of walls with of 28 gopurams. You enter the temple proper at the fourth ring – shoes off and your feet are immediately scorched on the baking hot stone flagging. People everywhere sitting on the floor picnicking.....there is also a temple elephant who looks rather agitated, poor thing, as she takes the proffered rupees off the devotee, slaps them on the head with her trunk in benediction, and then hands it to her keeper. It might be a beautiful temple but every single structure is covered in scaffolding and sheeting and swarming with workmen. The innumerable Vishnu shrines are all denied to non Hindus......so we can see none of the priceless treasures, or we can peer at the inner shrine over the heads of the devotees. Still, it is so big we are over an hour in there.

There is a famous temple built on a rock outcrop in Trichy also, but with the heat building and David's wonky ankle, we
Temple gods
give that one a miss – 400 steps up without shade is not an option. So we set off for our heritage property in Chettinad. On the way, we stop to visit the fort at Thirulyam. 100 rupees each to get in, and 50 for the cameras (the latter, we suspect, going straight into the pocket of the ticket seller) and we set off up. The fort confirms the rule we are beginning to form that there is an inverse correlation between the cost of entry and how interesting a site is. The fort is built on a big rock outcrop, Even the guidebook says it is of inferior construction, which thesis is supported by how little there is left of it. We climb the steps in what is now the midday heat, sweating under our silly, but in this case highly practical hats. At the top, there is a brick mound in the centre of a fortified wall. Is that really all there is? Closer inspection reveals a tiny shrine cut into the wall of rock and accessible by a metal staircase. Sara gets halfway up the stairs, far enough to establish there is no point going any further.
Health and safety at work


Chettinad is the home of the Chettiars, a once prosperous banking and business community. It is also known for its local cuisine, architecture, and religious temples. The area is also known for its 18th century mansions. Our hotel is one of those, now converted. The mansions are all characterised by wide courtyards and spacious rooms embellished with marble and teak. The basic design comprises a ""thinnai"" which is an enclosed courtyard surrounded by family rooms. The walls are smooth and are made of special plaster. This technique keeps the interior of the house cool during the hot and humid Indian summers. High ceilinged, airy and well ventilated, the house has one courtyard near the entrance which leads to the imposing main door, made of wood with extraordinarily intricate carvings of mythological figures.



Checking in is a strange experience as there is no reception desk. We sit down and the lad on duty at the door scuttles off to find someone more senior. A cold towel and welcome drink arrive, then eventually a third person with necklaces who eventually takes us to our room. This hotel is a welcoming oasis of calm in a way the last
Less a temple, more a building site
one was not. We abandon any thought of going for a walk and settle down to relax for the afternoon.

Brihadishwara temple, double gopurams
When kings set out to impress, they usually do it well. Rajaraja Chola I was no exception. Instead of having the highest cathedral with the best vaulting, he opted for a massive temple in his capital Thanjavur, to celebrate his conquests in south India and the consolidation of his reign. Completed in 1010 it vies with and probably beats most of the great churches in Europe, certainly at that early date.

Mr Hussain tells us it will take two hours to visit. We are sceptical, no temple having taken us that long. When we cannot find a guide, we are sure we will be round within the hour. But as ever, he is right. The main Shiva shrine sits under a 200ft high vimana covered in carvings, and is the middle of a huge courtyard surrounded by pillared porticos, with subsidiary shrines dotted around. Subsequent rulers in the 16th century added to the place, but the sculptures are all so stylised that it is impossible to tell what date anything else is. The hot sun turns the sandstone a golden shade. Despite the number of visitors, it never feels crowded, except when we join the queue to the inner sanctum.
Brihadishwara temple, vimana over the Shiva shrine
We’re disappointed to discover that the much vaunted 11th century frescos are in said sanctum, which is open only to the priests. There are frescos in some of the portico but they are 600 years more recent and much less impressive.

The interpretation centre proves unusually interesting, especially given the lack of a guide. The bored curator asks us where we are from. On hearing we’re English he proceeds to sing David Cameron’s praises. Cameron recently went to Sri Lanka and spoke out in favour of the Tamils. Our new found friend is, of course, also a Tamil and would really like to see a separate Tamil state. He also says that if the Brits were still in charge the country would be much more developed. Not the sort of thing you expect to hear these days in India.

We retreat back to the hotel at lunchtime, and risk life and limb once more crossing the road to our new favourite restaurant, the Sri Krishna Bhavan. This time, a larger meal than the night before, plus lime sodas and water costs a mere £3.

In the afternoon we set off to the palace. After the palaces of
Exiting the shrine
Rajasthan, we’re expecting something spectacular. It is not to be. We enter a dusty courtyard and are relieved of 500 rupees (£5) which buys us entrance to six different parts of the palace. The whole place is decrepit and needs some serious money spending on it. First up is the Maratha durbar hall. The hall itself is colourfully painted, but the courtyard is in rack and ruin. Next we head into a decrepit hall with dampstained walls and ancient display cabinets filled with random collections of items – dolls, china,weapons..... you name it. An attendant appears and tells us there is an extra charge for this superlative gallery. We start to demur but cough up when we find the fee is 2 pence, which is about what it’s worth. The prince’s library has an eclectic selection, including anatomy guidebooks, a map of London in 1809, pictures depicting assorted hideous forms of torture and death in early China, 19th century paintings of Indian towns and some manuscripts on palm. Last up is the art gallery. It has some beautiful sculptures and bronzes, but by now we’re hot and have already seen a lot of stunningly similar works of art, and this
Tanjore palace, Maratha durbar hall
particular part of the palace is overrun by French tourists who gawp at each exhibit in groups of ten or so. The best and worst bit is the courtyard. It has an elaborate pagoda style tower which is very beautiful, but is ruined by the addition of smoked glass windows to one whole side of the Nayak durbar hall built in 1600.



We retire back to the hotel. Having seen almost no tourists apart from French all holiday, we are surprised and not a little dismayed to find a massive coach party of 40 Germans checking in. We have to defend our room as a porter demands to deliver some Teutonic luggage to us. He tries to shove it through the door but is repulsed. We opt for an early club sandwich to ensure we are in and out of the restaurant before the group arrive, and settle in for an evening of editing photos, reading and packing ready to set off again in the morning.

Gangaikonda Cholapuram temple
Today is a temple day. We rise early in Tranquebar, the morning sea mist lingering over the Danish fort. Off we go, aiming for Gangaikonda Cholapuram, one of the great Chola temples built by King Rajendra Chola I in the early part of the 11th century. It is a magnificently carved temple, though extremely difficult to locate; Mr Hussein asks for confirming directions many times, and it is always “another 3 km” away.......anyway when located it is virtually deserted. It is under the Architectural Survey of India (ASI) so basically it is a historic monument with a small “active” shrine in the middle. Just as we like it, more carving and history than in a living temple. It’s one of the ‘wow’ sights of the holiday so far.

Because we like to go off the beaten track, we have realised by now that our itinerary includes a lot of places Mr Hussain does not know. He has no satnav or map (and indeed did not seem to be much good at map reading when we gave him a street plan of Pondicherry), so has to reply entirely on asking passers-by. Mercifully, he has none of the false pride that British men
Lord Shiva's trdent, with offerings impaled
are so prone to that stops them from asking for directions. Policemen are addressed as ‘sir, men of his own age as ‘anna’, older men have a different title and so on. Women, of course, are never asked for directions.

On then to Kumbakonam, a complete mess of a town, full of ‘living temples’ i.e. ones that are still in use for worshippers. The ridiculous notion that we could see three or four becomes clear very quickly as we sit in gridlocked traffic. We identify one on our list, the Nageswaran temple, another Chola temple, and scoot round fairly swiftly as time is passing and all temples close at 2pm for the Indian equivalent of a siesta. On to Darasuram. This temple was built by another Chola king in the 12th century. Each king seemed to need to build a new temple and capital to establish his mark on posterity. The heat has really built up now and we swelter our way around, seeking any shade available.

Enough! We head for Thanjavur, stopping en route at a petrol station for a toilet break. In one of the more bizarre photocalls, as Sara stands guard for David by
Nageswaran Temple, Kumbakonam
the non locking toilet door she is approached by a young man with a cameraphone who begs to be allowed to take her picture. It never happens in London......

The hotel in Thanjavur is a fairly new business hotel. For a mere £35/night we have a suite comprising a massive bedroom, bathroom and sitting room. Dinner is taken in the veggie restaurant across the street, where we splash out £4 (between us) for our meal and drinks. We opt to sit inside, to avoid the roar and fumes of the non stop traffic that assail those choosing to sit outdoors, and in the vain hope of avoiding the mosquitoes. But no, Sara once more provides dinner for a couple of mosquitoes that were passing by, despite being plastered in repellent and covered head to toe in long sleeved shirt, trousers and socks. The AC room seems to be the sole preserve of families with small children and foreigners. The other customers are incurious, but the waiters stand and watch us for pretty much the whole meal.

Chidambaram temple
Our first stop after leaving Pondicherry is the vast temple at Chidambaram. Another of the important Shiva temples of south India, and considerably less hassling than those we have visited so far. This is clearly a very rich temple. There is an important ceremony of some sort taking place. The temple is full of Brahmins in their distinctive white sarongs, with the Brahmin string diagonally across their chests and with partly shaven heads, and the crowd is massed outside the gold roofed inner sanctum, which on this occasion we are allowed to approach. But given the crush of devotees straining to watch the priests perform the ceremony, we can see very little. Much ringing of bells and clashing of cymbals; somewhere inside there a priceless bejewelled image of Nataraja, but it is not visible. We drift off around the vast pillared walkway around the sanctum, intermittently turning off to visit yet another shrine to a different deity. And always the heavy dominant smell of the temple, a mix of flowers and scented oil and ghee and that indefinable smell of the massed ranks of humanity. We leave the first temple and wander slowly – very slowly, given the heat – towards
Brahmin at temple
the tank, the holy body of water which is almost invisible behind high walls. We find a second temple, with painted ceilings and columns that makes up what it lacks in size and grandeur with the quality of the decoration.

Onwards to Tranquebar. Established by the Danish East India Company (yes they had one too) in 1620, the Danes sought to use it as a trading base with varying degrees of success until 1845 when they rather gave up and sold it to the British for a few bob. It has a ruined fort, and several Protestant churches established in the 17th and 18th centuries. All neat and well ordered, not Indian at all. We stay in a heritage property called Bungalow on the Beach despite having two floors. Nobody can tell us how old the place is, but it looks as if it could date back to Danish times. We visit the Danish fort and ponder how tough the earliest settlers had it. At one point it was 25 years before the next Danish ship made it safely to Tranquebar, by which time there was only one Dane left alive. Luckily he was the fellow in charge of
Danish fort at Tranquebar
the port!



The village was badly affected by the 2004 tsunami. Over 800 people died, mostly women and children, but there are no obvious signs remaining, apart from a memorial stone.

Meenakshi Temple, Madurai
We hired a car to take us from Mammallapuram south to Pondicherry. To say that was an adventure would be an understatement! There are no traffic signals and all vehicles are equipped with working horns. The roads were crowded with buses, three-wheeled taxis,motorcycles and bicycles all vying for position. Add the horns into this mix and you have a symphony of sorts, and somehow it all works. Now crossing the street is another story!

Pondicherry was occupied at one time by the French and as a result a strong French influence is still seen today. There is canal that divides the French quarter from the Tamil side, and the differences are quite distinct. The French quarter is very distinct with its white colonial architecture, while the Tamil side is quite colorful with many shades of yellow and blue.

Feb 19

We spent 3 nights in Pondicherry leaving on the overnight bus to Madurai. Madurai is one of the oldest cities in south Asia and the location of the Meenakshi temple, parts of which date back well over a thousand years. The stone carvings are amazing and the vastness of the temple itself is mind boggeling. We only stayed

in Madurai for the day, then hired a car for two days to take us to Kanyakumari, the southern most point in India.It is also the meeting point of the Bay of Bengal, the Indian Ocean and the Arabian Sea. People come here specifically to watch the sunrise and sunset. Following a night in Kanyakumari, we rejoined our driver and headed for Varkala, in Kerala,stopping along the way to view the scenery and a few beaches. We arrived here late afternoon yesterday, and will probably stay a few days just to veg on the beach, hike some of the cliffs and maybe take a Keralan Cooking class. Would love to stay in touch, so feel free to leave comments.

February 14th 2015
Published: February 14th 2015


Shore temple
Mahabalipuram is a UNESCO world heritage site. In the 7th and 8th centuries the Pallava kings built a number of monuments right on the seashore of what was then a major part. They comprise rathas (temples in the form of chariots), mandapas (cave sanctuaries), giant open-air reliefs such as 'Arjuna's Penance' and the Shore Temple.

The Shore Temple is our first stop. We pick up a government guide at the parking lot, with the apparent approval of our driver. The Shore Temple was built out of granite and is on the beach, although fenced off from it and surrounded by grass. The carvings are heavily eroded by wind and sea spray and some are pretty difficult to discern without the guide's help. There were once seven temples, but the other six got swept into the sea, probably by a long ago tsunami. The 2004 tsunami hit the coast here also, killing 27 people and making hundreds more homeless. It feels odd to be standing in the middle of where it swept in.

The rathas come next. They are five temples carved out of granite outcrops, in the shape of chariots and dedicated to different gods. They have figure carvings also,

and have not suffered as much erosion as the Shore Temple. Parts are unfinished, as the Pallavas were often away fighting the Chalukya kings and so got diverted from their religious endeavours. By now the hordes are everywhere: it is Saturday so the world and his wife are out visiting, as are innumerable school parties (who are at least engaging).

Off to the open air carvings: Arjuna's Penance was carved by the Pallavas on a large granite outcrop, very detailed, and quite fun, telling suitable moralistic tales. Sara encounters her first acolytes of the trip : “Hello what your name where you come from?” Then there is also “One photo one photo”, where the game is to take a photo of a group of grinning schoolchildren, then show them the photo on the LCD display, which sends them away whooping with delight.

At this point our hitherto reliable guide starts behaving suspiciously.....we are suddenly beckoned into a shop. Here we go. “Just looking no need to buy all things made by poor students very cheap price”. But didn’t we just see that same tat on a market stall? Out we march resolutely. He takes us next to the
Hello, what your name
local Hindu temple, explains it all, actually quite interesting. Then the killer: “Foreigner not allowed in temple, temple donation fee 500 rupees, you pay me I pay to temple”. Yeah, right. Do we look stupid?? NO. “But fee is...”. NO. “Man outside he look after your shoes”. “But we didn't have any shoes”. We give him his agreed guiding fee and off he stomps, without a temple donation or a tip. Why do they do this? Do they never learn? I suppose the answer is if even a few foreigners a day fall for it, it is worth it. Our driver is furious with him.

Back to the hotel. It is probably 35C today so it is an afternoon lazing around. We are on holiday after all and this, we realise, is one of very few days in the course of the four weeks when we can do literally nothing.

Varadharaja Perumal Temple
Mr Hussain tells us we need to leave Chennai by 8am, so we’re up at 6.45 to pack and have breakfast. It’s a two hour drive to Kanchipuram, where there are numerous temples of apparently great renown. This seems odd as it’s not all that far away, but of course we’d forgotten how long it takes to inch your way out of an Indian city. Several times we think we are reaching the edge of the town only for it all to start up again, but gradually the traffic thins and the houses and apartment blocks are replaced by open ground interspersed with factories. Samsung, Honda and Hyundai all have big factories, with company buses lined up outside. We suspect the workers have to get up a lot earlier than us.

Spot on time, we draw into Kanchipuram. It’s close enough to his home base that Mr Hussain knows which temples to take us to, in which order, and what time they close (Shiva and Vishnu temples are different), which is lucky as we know which temples to visit, but not which order to tackle them in. At the first temple, he issues strong warnings: “many thieves here, don’t take
The temple tank
your camera, watch out for pickpockets, don’t fall for anyone telling you there is an entrance charge as there isn’t, don’t agree to let anyone be your guide”. The place is sounding less attractive by the minute! Gripping our money bag tightly we head into the temple. ‘Fee for camera 100 rupee’ is the first cry. ‘We don’t have one’ eventually does the trick, but we do of course have to leave our sandals. After last year’s disaster when Sara’s walking sandals got stolen at Somnathpur, the very last temple of the holiday, we are both equipped with £2 flip flops from Primark.

Ekambeshwarar temple itself proves a disappointment. It has a tall gopuram and a large and gloomy pillared walkway around the inner sanctum, but with limited decoration. Other tourists do have a camera, which irks us, but to fair there’s not a huge amount to film, given that non Hindus are not allowed into the inner sanctum which is where most of the highlights are meant to be including the 3500 year old mango tree, and the greater part of the precincts of the temple seem closed to everyone. Since Mr Hussain has also told us to
temple carving
be quick, so that we have time to visit the other temples before they close at midday, we leave after our cursory inspection. Disappointing place.

Off to Kamakshi temple. This one has the gopuram(or main tower) covered in scaffold. We enter the courtyard, where a queue snakes endlessly back on itself confined by iron railings to enter the sanctum. The queue is stationary, we decide we do not want to be trapped inside only to be told we cannot enter after an hour's queueing to be told we are not Hindus. Once more the treasures are hidden from the non-believer. Even for temple afficionados we are getting a bit fed up with Kanchipuram.

Finally, Varadharaja Perumal Temple, supposedly the best of the lot. This one apparently has fewer thieves hanging around the precincts. We pay our 1 rupee fee to enter the 100 pillared hall, which has exactly what you would expect, scenes from the Mahabharata carved on the pillars, as explained by the very polite Brahmin priest who insists on showing us around. Quite informative so we give him a little something for his trouble. There is a large tank with a couple of structures in the middle, as
I wish he didn't make me read about temples....
are often found in temples; and a subsidiary shrine we can visit. Once more however, the inner sanctum is only for Hindus and the massive precincts are also closed completely. We admire the gopuram and we are off again, heading for Mahabalipuram.



By now we’re in the countryside, where we are reminded that you’re never far from people in most of India. Small villages, shrines and schools pop up every two minutes. We reach Mahaballipuram which seems to comprise a series of resort hotels strung along the beach. Ours is called the Ideal Beach Resort and proves very comfortable. We’re not used to staying anywhere in India just to relax and read a book, so it makes an extremely pleasant change to sit on the beach and do just that for the afternoon. At dinner we are offered fresh white mullet, possibly the fish we watched the boats bringing in this afternoon on the beach. We have it cooked tandoori style with pilau rice, dal and naan bread, washed down with Kingfisher beer – best meal of the holiday so far.

St Mary's Church
Day 2 in Chennai and the first stop is Fort St George. (Skip the rest of this paragraph if you’re not interested in history!) The fort was built by the British East India Company on land granted to them by the local Nayak ruler in 1639 and completed on St. George's Day 1640. It was established as a fortified trading post, not as the basis for military expansion or the creation of an Empire, whatever revisionist historians might argue. From its establishment by Royal Charter granted by Elizabeth I in 1600, the Company was only interested in trade. It regarded war as unfavourable to trade. However as events transpired over the next centuries, Fort St. George, which was the foundation of Madras town and became the seat of the Madras Presidency of the Company, was the cornerstone on which British rule in India, and the creation of the British Empire, was built.

History lesson over. The sun is shining, and we imagine there will be lots of walking around the site, visiting all the old buildings, which will be nicely preserved in aspic as they would be in the UK or the US. Wrong. The first hint that maybe the
A photo for David's mother
place was not quite what we thought was when we were asked to record our passport numbers as we entered. Even for a country as fond of bureaucracy as India is, that’s unusual. It transpires the site is now the home of the army and navy headquarters in Chennai. There are naval officers in white uniforms and female police officers brandishing swagger sticks everywhere. At almost every turn, there is a sign saying no entry. We visit the museum, which has some interesting sections and some exceptionally dull ones. St Mary's church, the oldest Anglican church in India built in 1680, is still intact, and there we encounter our first foreign tourists of the trip, in the shape of a coachload of Brits and one of Japanese. Among the memorial stones is one to the memory of the vicar, who is confusingly described as having shown ‘sedulous and temperate zeal’ in his efforts to convert the heathen. Next we follow a sign hoping to visit Clive of India’s house, but are turned away on the grounds that it is now an office. We find some of the original buildings but they have been abused and are hidden behind hoardings.
A lousy display even in 1857

Somewhat disappointed, we find Mr Hussain and set off for the government museum. 15 rupees entrance fee for Indians, 250 for foreigners. Now, that it is still cheap if there is something worth seeing.... The museum was opened in 1857 and most sections appear not to have changed since then. The early galleries of sculptures, which seemed a bit dull, prove to be among the highlights of the trip. The zoology section offered light amusement for the sheer awfulness of the exhibits. Cases full of animal skeletons, or parts thereof, are followed by some of the worst taxidermy ever seen, featuring animals that seemed to have died of old age and mange. Even that beats the botany section hands down. We find some nice bronzes but that is a temporary uplift. The next building features anthropology which should have been a warning. Actually, it is a warning, but David likes to get full value from any visit and we certainly didn’t feel we’d had much thus far. The building itself, which was built by the British in 1789 is actually quite impressive, though horribly run down, but the exhibits – well, let’s just say that the boomerangs of Tamil Nadu
Goddesses
are possibly one of the more interesting cases.



Defeated, we retired to the hotel, to relax and read our books for the afternoon. Later, Sara decides she’d like another look at the jewellery on sale at the craft bazaar over the road from the hotel. It’s a short walk, but takes a long time owing to the problem of crossing the road. It’s at a junction, and there are traffic lights, so you might think there’d be no problem. However, red stop lights are only suggestive in India, and traffic continues to flow in at least two of three directions at all times. Eventually, we find three Indian women also waiting to cross, and hang back until they set off, gesturing us to follow. We thank them profusely once safely over. On the return journey, there is no such luck, until we spot a traffic policeman loitering nearby. ‘Please can you help us?’ He beams and marches into the road holding up his arm to stop the traffic, and we set off confidently behind him. One tuk tuk stops at his command, while the rest of the traffic continues unabated, some yelling at him to get out
Naturaja Lord of the dance
of the way. Somehow, we make it safely across to the other side and retreat back to the safety of the hotel. It took over half an hour for our dinner to be served last night, so we opt for room service where we can carry on reading and editing photos.

DSCF0005
Well, i managed to post some pictures, tried to add captions but failed, still working out the kinks. So basically the first three are from Chennai, the rest from Mammallapuram. Will work on getting it altogether for the next post.



Well we made it! Arrived safely on Tues night after 28 hrs of travel. Chennai was a bit of a work out for the senses, an assault of sights, sounds and smells. Not overly hot,very pleasant in fact at 23C. We did as much exploring as the jet lag would allow. We explored a few temple complexes and the Basillica of San Tomme, where we witnessed a wedding in progress.Took a stroll along the prominade at Marina Beach. The food so far has been delicious and very inexpensive, lunch can be had for around $2 and dinner around $4.

Took the bus today and moved on to Mamallapuram and spent the afternoon exploring a large park that has huge boulders, stone carvings and stone temples dating from as far back as 630 AD. There are some huge reliefs on the side of a stone hill, an absolute marvel when you think of the era in which they
DSCF0003
were carved.

We will stay here one more day and move on to Pondicherry on Sat. I have taken lots of pictures and was going to post them here, but am having technical difficulties, so I will keep trying and hope to resolve that soon.

Bringing in the boat
We set off from Heathrow on a grey English morning, to board BA's brand new Boeing 787. David points out the elegantly upturned wing ends as we see the plane from the air bridge. “It's just a plane”, remarks Sara. Oh dear. Anyway David is impressed, it is fabulous, almost silent, and with a stylish cabin that looks like it has been designed by BMW. And a lovely crew. We don’t often praise BA, but on this occasion, fair's fair. Then it's Chennai airport (or Madras as it is still called by the airlines) , 12.35 in the morning. Only two flights coming in, the other being Lufthansa disgorging holidaying Heinrichs and Brunhildes. Obviously giving Greece a miss this winter......can't think why. Anyway it the fastest Indian airport exit ever, and we’re checked into our hotel by 1.30am.

Uncharacteristically, we sleep till 10am and dash down to breakfast before it ends. First breakfasts on holiday are never quite right – you pick a mix of different cuisines and end up feeling slightly queasy. Well, we did anyway....

Mr Hussain, our driver, arrives early to take us out – a good sign, given he will be looking after us for
Bringing the catch ashore
the next 4 weeks. We ask to go to Sao Thome basilica, but end up at St Thomas’s Mount instead. No matter, we had it on our list of places to see! It’s a small chapel on a hill built on the spot where St Thomas was martyred, run through with a spear or an arrow in 72AD. Indian Catholic churches have a style all their own, with an unusual mix of the Catholic delight for statues and saints, often surrounded by flashing lights, and Indian styling. Still not sure about the statue of a saint wearing a dhoti. There are allegedly spectacular views over Chennai. Problem 1: there is a heat haze/pollution so not much is visible. Problem 2: Chennai doesn’t seem to have any tall buildings so all you see is a hazy urban sprawl.

Undeterred, we ask to visit the Kapaleeswarar Temple, dedicated to Shiva. ‘Temple is closed from 2.00 to 4.00’ says Mr Hussain. It is 1.30 and the temple is half an hour away. Note to self, tell him the w whole itinerary upfront next time to avoid this problem. Ever adaptable, we ask to fill in the time by going to Guindy National
Crocodile or dinosaur
Park. This is less grand than it sounds, being the grounds of the old governor’s mansion, now protected as a nature reserve. Mr Hussain nods in approval at our choice. Once there, we find you can’t walk or drive though it, but you can visit the children’s park or the snake park. We opt for the snake park, for the princely sum of 70p including two camera permits. It proves much more interesting than expected. The snakes are all kept safe behind glass walls, but that does not stop the pace being plastered with signs warning of the dangers of touching them! As well as snakes, there are crocodiles and an extremely difficult to detect green chameleon who really does look for all the world like a leaf. OK I know it sounds a bit boring but it was quite interesting.

Next we manage to communicate successfully our desire to go Sao Thome, a white building glittering in the bright sunlight. It’s proud boast is that is one of only three churches to be built over the tomb of a saint, the others being St Peters in Rome and Santiago di Compostela. We read about the lives of the apostles, learning of their varied but all gruesome deaths for their faith (David particularly enjoyed that bit), and visit the tomb of St Thomas the apostle, who was obviously moved down from the hillside to be buried.

There is still half an hour to fill in before the temple opens. Mr Hussain suggests a trip to the beach. We concur. At first sight, this looks like a mistake – miles of sand with a few empty stalls. We wander slowly towards the water, and find there are fishing boats pulled up at one end. This is our first reminder that in India a picture only tells half the story, as it cannot capture the smells. Here, the good mingles uncomfortably with the bad – a strong scent of sandalwood and incense by the boats and their nets piled on the sand (presumably from incense burning to seek blessings before going out to fish) co-exists with the smell of rotting fish from the piles of small dead fish, about the size of whitebait. Unwanted catch? Too small to sell? Who knows...the dead rotting crow impaled on a stick poking out of the sand (explain that one) certainly offers no clue.

As we ponder these questions, a fishing boat arrives back to shore with its catch, crashing through the breakers. This reminds David of the eighteenth century arrivals in Madras from England, who after six months at sea had to clamber down from their ship into a rowing boat and be taken to shore through these same breakers, hoping they would not be tossed into the sea by the pitching of the boat and drowned before they even set foot on land. Anyway the fisherman start pulling the boat far enough out of the water to stop it floating off on the next wave, but this is a harder job than might be expected, taking four men a good ten minutes. Finally, with the boat tied up to another one, they tie the nets, with the catch still inside, onto two stout pieces of wood, and carry it up to a roadside stall where shoppers wait patiently for the nets to be unravelled and the fish put up for sale. Definitely the freshest fish ever!



Back to the Kapaleeswarar Temple. The main feature is a typically South Indian gopuram (gateway), 37m high, decorated with lots of coloured Gods. Inside there a number of smaller shrines with their own towers. It is interesting enough, but not spectacular. So we decide to head back to the hotel for the day.......

sri meenakshi temple
HE SAID...
We were leaving Pondicherry and heading south west to Madurai. We woke early and walked to Hot Breads bakery to pick up some snacks (croissants and savoury rolls) for breakfast and lunch. We left Hotel Surguru in a minibus at 9am and headed to Villupuram Junction. We waited at the train station and jumped on the train as it slowed – we only had two minutes to get on before it lurched off again. We had a six hour trip to Madurai ahead of us.

We shared our berth on the sleeper train with four Indian army officers who were very friendly. I started reading “Stories told by the Mother II” which a fellow traveller had picked up at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry. I put it down momentarily, and one of the officers picked it up and started reading it. I had visions of never seeing the book again, but he only managed a few stories before putting it down again. I’ve realised that sharing between strangers is commonly accepted in India. We shared our snacks with them, and they were very interested in hearing about our travels in India. One of the officers looked through
villupuram station
all of Ren’s photos on her camera after she showed him a photo of the beach where I’d picked up my necklace/bracelets – they liked them and wanted to know what I paid for them. They all agreed I got a good price.

We stopped at Tiruchirappalli station at around 1pm. We were half-way to Madurai, so we jumped off the train to buy some chai (tea) from a tiny stall on the platform. We only had a few minutes before the train left, so it was fairly stressful, especially when everyone else from the train had the same idea. The chai was fantastic. We settled in, snacked on our savoury rolls and enjoyed the ride. The army officers had got off the train, and our birth filled up with new passengers (a small family and a single female) for the second half of the journey.

We arrived in Madurai at 4pm, and we weren’t prepared for what lay ahead. We jumped off the train, made our way along the platform, walked up a flight of stairs and suddenly found ourselves engulfed in a seething sea of humanity. We had turned into an overpass from the station to
villupuram station
the city, and it was claustrophobic. Everyone was going in the same direction, and there was simply no way of stopping. We had our packs on (which made us heavier than everyone around us), and we literally flowed with the masses. I don’t remember walking – we were just jammed into a mass of bodies that carried us along with them. We managed to point ourselves in the direction of the stairs on the other side of the overpass and finally emerged into the dusty streets of Madurai. An old Muslim man had been walking alongside me all the way, and when he found out I was from Australia, he decided to give me a history lesson on when Captain Cook landed in Botany Bay. I finally caught sight of Ren, so we headed straight to the Madurai Residency Hotel. We checked in at 4.30pm, dropped our packs and made our way to Sri Meenakshi Temple.

We arrived at the temple at 5.30pm, and this was to be a highlight of our trip to-date. We wandered around the outside and then headed into the temple itself. A festival was on at the time, and there were a number of
villupuram station
processions making their way around the long stone corridors. We nearly met our fate when a group of men carrying a large shrine of Krishna turned a corner where we were standing and lost their footing. Masses of people fell backwards and rammed us against a stone wall. The shrine (which was being held aloft by two long pieces of wood) tilted violently, and I thought it was going to end up on top off us. Luckily, the devotees carrying the shrine managed to right themselves, and we lived to tell the tale.

Ren lit a lamp for her father as we made our way counter-clockwise around the temple’s corridors (which may explain why the shrine nearly ended up on top of us, because everyone else was walking clockwise). I loved this temple. There was something very calm and inclusive about the atmosphere inside, despite the masses of people who we were continually rubbing shoulders with.

As we wandered back to the hotel I picked up some postcards from an old man in the street. The back streets of Madurai were just coming to life at dusk, and it was fascinating walking through them. We got back to
villupuram station
the hotel and headed to the rooftop restaurant for dinner. We shared a selection of curries with our fellow travellers – gobi aap ki passand aloo (cauliflower curry), dingiri mutter (mushroom and green pea curry), vegetable chettinad (spicy vegetable curry) and chana masala (chickpea curry), all of which were served with rice and naan (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven). It was fantastic and very, very hot.

As the wind picked up and the evening grew long, we decided to go to bed... and that’s when the gastro struck. We’ve been travelling together for many years now, and we’ve always carried Gastro-Stop with us, but this was the first time I’ve ever had to use it. Luckily, it lived up to its name. We had a four hour bus trip to Thekkady in the morning, and the last thing I wanted to worry about was gastroenteritis.



SHE SAID...
It was a travel day and we had to stock up on breakfast and lunch items, so after a very quick trip down to Hot Breads Bakery in Pondicherry, we caught a minibus for the one hour ride to the railway station at Villupuram. The station
train to madurai
wasn't too busy, so we walked around for a little while and bought chais (teas) from the station chai wallah (tea seller).

Indian Railways is the largest employer in Asia, and as much as I like seeing people employed, the organiser in me couldn’t help but mentally streamline their systems as I watched passengers being put through multiple processes – each handled by a different staff member at a different counter, and each requiring a new queue. I'm increasingly realising that the preferred method of operation in India is that a particular job or task can only be performed by one person at a time - they don't seem to like the concept that the same person who checks your ticket can also stamp it and tick it off the ledger. I know it provides more employment to use more people than is really required, but the inefficiency in time is significant and it is harder to maintain the quality of the product. Anyway, back to our train trip.

We were in second class 3AC sleeper carriages again for the six hour daytime journey to Madurai. It was an unexpectedly enjoyable journey. The windows were clear this time
train to madurai
so it was great to watch the Tamil Nadu countryside roll by, and we were in a compartment with Indian Army Officers who wanted to chat. They questioned us about Australia, our views on India and life in general. In return, they answered all our questions about their work and lives. It seemed important to them that I felt safe in India, and they asked if we’d had any security issues – we hadn’t. One of the officers mentioned a tourist police phone number that I should ring if I had any problems (and he rattled off the number). I gathered that it had been a topic they had been briefed on as they all went into ‘official’ mode when talking about it, and then visibly relaxed when I changed the subject.

The Army officers were on a trip to Tamil Nadu to organise a recruitment rally. They loved hearing about where in India we had already travelled to, and I showed them my photos of the beach at Mamallapuram because some of them hadn’t been to that part of India. However, instead of handing my camera back, one of the senior officers started flipping through all the photos
sri meenakshi temple from hotel
on my camera, asking for explanations of each one. It’s a good thing I didn’t have any ‘personal’ photos on that card! 😉

They were so involved in conversations with us that they very nearly missed their stop. Of all the conversations we had with them, two gave me most cause for thought. Firstly, the younger Officers (in their late 20s to early 30s) were very accepting of arranged marriages, and were happy to let their parents decide their future partners for them. Secondly, I was very surprised to learn that all their official paperwork is written in English, even though all oral communication is in Hindi. They all spoke English to some level, but were not very confident about it and were happy for the opportunity to speak it.

After they left, the two remaining guys in our compartment decided to watch a DVD on their laptop... and turned the laptop around and the sound up so we could watch too. Kim and I rolled our eyes at the thought of watching a DVD on a train, and a mainstream Hollywood one at that, but we were hooked within minutes. I couldn’t tell you what the film
streets of madurai
was called, but we were most disappointed that the guy had to get off the train before the film ended. The young family who got on next were more interested in arguing with each other than talking to us, so I finally got some reading done.

The only other excitement on that journey was that Lee and Andrew decided to get off at one of the stations to buy us some chais (a chai wallah hadn’t come through in a while), and Karni jumped out with them to hurry the process along as the train only stopped for two to four minutes at the smaller stations. It was a close call, but they made it back just in time with delicious chais in hand. For reasons unfathomable to mere mortals like us, the chai at train stations and on trains in India was so much more delicious than any other chai I’ve ever tasted. The savoury rolls and pastries we’d bought at Hot Breads Bakery in Pondicherry were quite delicious, and I immediately wished we’d bought more.

There were two ‘best’ parts of the train trip for me – firstly, all the wallahs (sellers) who appeared out of
sri meenakshi temple
thin air as soon as the train started moving. The chai wallah clutched a tea urn in one hand and little cups in the other and for a few rupees we had hot sweet milky tea. Apparently the hot sweet thick coffee was very good too. The cold drink wallahs came next, followed by the wallahs of hot food and snacks. It was a constant wallah stream through our carriage, but none of them were pushy or rude. They were merely making a living and in the process, making our train journey all the more comfortable. The second best thing for me was having such a fun and lively conversation with a group of strangers who were as curious about us as we were about them.

We arrived at Madurai station around 4pm. I have never felt under siege by humanity before, but I came very close when we stepped into the streaming crowd at this station. Once you committed to the stream, you just got pushed forward by the momentum of the crowd until you were deposited outside the station. I could barely turn around (I had my pack on) to check on Andrew as we were propelled
sri meenakshi temple
forward. We artfully dodged the rickshaw wallahs (rickshaw drivers) vying for business and walked for ten minutes across busy streets to our hotel. The Madurai Residency Hotel was a very clean, standard business-styled hotel, but with very little character. Although at this point of the trip, I was badly in need of a fix of crisp white sheets, and this hotel totally delivered.

Madurai is an ancient city of over 2 million people. The Tamils have a recorded history going back to the 3rd Century BC, which shows an unbroken Dravidian lineage that they are very proud of. My ancestors on Dad’s side originated from this part of Tamil Nadu, and I suppose I should be proud of this ‘ancient people’ legacy too, but unfortunately this sort of ‘racial pride’ nearly always goes hand-in-hand with racial superiority. It can mean that marriages outside of the Tamil community (like my Mum and Dad’s) are frowned upon – and I really don’t understand or have time for that sort of prejudice.

That evening after confirming the dress code for the tenth time – long trousers and shoulders covered for both men and women – we left for the magnificent Sri
sri meenakshi temple
Meenakshi Temple. The temple was a short walk from our hotel, and on turning a corner, the distinctive brightly-coloured gopuram (gatehouse tower) and outer temple walls came into view at the end of the street. The street was blocked off to traffic, and it was very strange (but quite pleasant!) to be walking along an Indian road without fear of being deafened by horns or knocked over by a speeding motorbike.

Security was the tightest I’ve seen for any tourist site I’ve been to. After leaving our shoes and cameras at a nearby shop, we were screened and patted down by guards – there was a separate queue for women, attended by female guards behind a curtain. Very sadly, photography was strictly forbidden. I say ‘sadly’ because it was a beautiful temple and I would have loved to have some photographs to make sense of all the fast moving colour and movement we witnessed. Very strangely, you could pay a fee to take your phone in and take photos with your phone camera. This baffled me beyond belief. It still baffles me.

The Sri Meenakshi Temple is considered to be the most beautiful temple in South India. It
sri meenakshi temple
was originally built in the 7th Century, but work continued until the 18th Century. The temple complex inside the wall is incredibly vast. To our left was an ancient banyan tree, where childless women who wanted to conceive had hung brightly painted miniature cradles. Each of the Temple’s main entrances were arranged along the cardinal axes, with the 50m tall south gopuram structure the biggest and supposedly most detailed. Each gopuram was covered with intricately detailed and brightly painted figures of gods, demons, humans and animals. They have only recently started painting the gopura in multiple colours, so the colours were VERY vibrant. A part of me wishes they’d left them as they were. The complex has multiple shrines, each in a square enclosure surrounded by smaller inner gopura, and there is a sacred water tank enclosure and various halls that surround and connect the square enclosures.

We had a very lovely local guide accompanying us, without whom we would have lost our bearings within the first five minutes! We walked through the east entrance and entered a hall in which there were hundreds of white-clad men and women in colourful saris and other traditional dresses. We slowly made
sri meenakshi temple
our way through lamp-lit corridors and mazes of dimly lit rooms towards the inner sanctum. The air was thick with the smell of oils and spices from burning lamps and incense sticks.

The complex was very, very crowded with both local worshippers and pilgrims who had travelled from all over India. I watched a family walk past us – the father was carrying a child of about 18 months who had just had her ears pierced and her hair shaved close to the skull. Her eyes were also heavily ringed with kohl (so as not to attract the attention of spiteful spirits by being too cute). I was told that she had just been through one of the first (of many) age-related Hindu ceremonies.

Further inside, small oil lamps were being lit and placed in front of statues. There were many small stalls where we could buy the small oil lamps, and I lit a lamp for Dad... remembering that he had told me this was one of the most beautiful temples he had seen. I agree with Dad, this temple was one of the biggest highlights of the trip so far.

While some of us were
sri meenakshi temple
buying lamps, the group got separated as a procession of priests and devotees coursed their way through the narrow hallway we were standing in. The priests were carrying a statue, and the praying and chanting crowd was pressing in on them. Andrew and Brian bore the brunt of my weight as the crowd fell into me, and I fell back into them – pushing them into railings and a stone wall. The procession had reached a corner and couldn't all fit, and then suddenly surged forward. Andrew and Damien were tall enough to see what was happening, and they looked worried. However, I could barely see what was going on, as there was a sea of armpits in my face. The procession passed soon enough and we moved on to join the rest of the group, but I can see how easily a stampede could have occurred in such an enclosed place when crowd numbers aren’t controlled.

The Hall of One Thousand Pillars is a major attraction of the temple. It couldn’t be more colourful if it tried! I really loved the feel of this place. The pillars were all carved with different figures, and my favourite were the
sri meenakshi temple
yalis (mythical beasts with a head of an elephant and body of a lion). At one end of the Hall stood the figure of Nataraja (the dancing form of Shiva), dancing the cosmic dance.

It would have been easy to spend much more than the two hours we had here, watching the people lighting lamps and praying with such passion, but I’d started to feel like I was intruding and had to keep reminding myself to stop staring. We retreated from the temple, retrieved our shoes and spent a few minutes engaging in the obligatory checking out of pashminas and hand carved ornaments in the handicrafts emporium (where we’d left our shoes).

Towards the end of our walk through the temple, our local guide had questioned me about my heritage (almost everyone I meet in India seems to need to know this!), but unlike anyone else, the only question he asked me was what I thought about the recent election results in Sri Lanka. I sidestepped the issue by saying I didn’t follow Sri Lankan politics, but it seems he did – in minute detail. I was given an impressive blow-by-blow account of the election and what he
sri meenakshi temple
thought of where Sri Lanka was heading. He would have got along very well with my Dad. 😊

We walked back to our hotel and later met for dinner on the rooftop. We shared a few vegetarian curries of aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry), dingiri mutter (mushroom and green pea curry), vegetable chettinad (spicy vegetable curry) and chana masala (chickpea curry), with rice and naan (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven). The food was delicious and some of the curries were VERY hot. I had a small lapse in concentration when ordering drinks and ordered an iced tea, which as its name suggested, came chock full of ice. As refreshing as it looked, sadly, I just couldn’t risk having it. 😞

Our quick walk through town that evening had given us a glimpse of masses of Hindu pilgrims, hordes of circling rickshaws, more poverty and beggars than we’d seen in the other towns and cities, and lots of bazaars and street markets. But we were running out of time to explore more of Madurai.

Our time there was even more compromised when the virus going around the group attacked Andrew in the stomach department
streets of madurai
at 2am. We were certain it hadn’t been anything Andrew had eaten as we had shared all our meals. We were up until 5am, at which point Andrew fell asleep. I had got the other bug (sore throat, cough and cold) that was also going through the group... which turned into a fever later that day. So I spent the early part of the next day looking for more drugs for both of us.

None of the pharmacies (called ‘medical shops’ in India) I found were open or likely to open before we left Madurai that morning. You know you are travelling with good people when Rao kindly offered us his supply of Imodium (but we were well stocked with Gastro-Stop), and Chris kindly offered us her stash of re-hydration tablets (which we’d completely neglected to pack!). Damien finally found an open pharmacy and bought us more supplies to keep Andrew comfortable and hydrated until we reached the next hotel. Thanks heaps guys!

We had known that getting sick was par for the course in India, but I had been so sure that of the two of us, I would have been the one to fall first with
rooftop dinner
a stomach bug. I would much, much, much rather be sick myself than have someone I love get sick, but I’m probably not alone in thinking that way.

We had planned to go back to the Sri Meenakshi Temple that morning, but sadly that plan didn’t work out. As for the city of Madurai, while I think it represents the colourful and lively part of southern Indian culture very well, it didn’t attract me very much. However, given we only had one day there, I don’t think I saw nearly enough of it to form a solid opinion... even though it certainly was an eye-opening experience.

Next we enter the Western Ghats ranges and travel west into Periyar National Park in Kerala.

HE SAID...
We left Mysore at 8.30pm the previous night and embarked on an 11 hour overnight train journey to Chennai. We sat and talked with two young students who were sharing our berth before settling into our bunks around 10.30pm. The gentle rocking of the train had me asleep in no time.

I woke at 6.30am and found some room on my bunk to catch up on my travel notes. We arrived in Chennai at 7am, scrambled off the train, negotiated the throngs of people pouring into Chennai Central and jumped into a minibus to begin our journey south. We were halfway through our south India travels, and we were heading down the eastern coastline of this vast country. We’d barely left the train station before pulling into the Emarald Hotel for breakfast, where we feasted on a buffet of pittu (steamed cakes), rajma curry (black pea curry), naan (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven), vadi (lentil fritters) and strong coffee. It was fantastic, and just what the doctor ordered. We’d been travelling for 12 hours without a shower, so we needed something to pick us up and keep us going.

We were only passing through
chennai central
Chennai on this trip. We finished breakfast, jumped into our minibus and headed to Mahabalipuram. As we sped along Chennai’s seafront, I was amazed by the starkness of the beach and surrounds. It’s difficult to get a feel for a place when you spend so little time there. After driving parallel to the coast for about an hour, we arrived at Hotel Mahabs and headed straight for the shower.

At 11am we set out on a bike tour of Mahabalipuram’s local temples, and to say the bikes were basic was a major understatement. We managed to ride all the way to the Five Rathas, rode/walked to the Shore Temple and then rode/walked to Krishna’s Butterball. The chaotic traffic and masses of people made it impossible to ride more than 50 metres without stopping to avoid cars, cows or children. We were still in the midst of the four day Pongal Festival, and it was fantastic (yet slightly unusual) when I realised that we were the only foreign tourists to be seen. I loved the relaxed family atmosphere at the Five Rathas and Krishna’s Butterball, but the walk to the Shore Temple to witness Shiva’s linga in the intense heat
chennai central
of the midday sun was all getting a bit too much – I needed a beer.

We finished our bike tour around 1pm and wandered to the seafront for lunch. We made our way up some narrow stairs to the atmospheric Santana Beach Restaurant, a rooftop restaurant overlooking the Bay of Bengal. The strong sea breeze gusting through this rooftop haven was very welcome, as we’d overheated on the bikes in Mahabalipuram’s hot dry midday heat. We shared a fried calamari masala with chips, and while Ren cooled down with a shandy, I recharged with a cold Kingfisher.

After lunch, Lee and I decided to dive into the surf that was rolling in from the Bay of Bengal. We had to disregard the state of the beach and turn a blind eye to the bloated cat that had washed up just in front of us. The waves were good for body surfing and the water was incredibly warm. It was a great experience and very refreshing. As we walked back along the beach I picked up a necklace and a few bracelets from a beach seller – I wanted something to remember my first Indian surf experience!

We headed back to the hotel and lazed by the pool for the rest of the day. The afternoon sun was searing, so we welcomed the chance to relax and cool down. I noticed a number of decrepit houses behind the hotel where small children were playing in dusty streets. Their poverty was evident, and yet here was I lazing beside a pool in an affluent hotel only metres from their crumbling homes. The social divide has weighed heavily on my conscience since I arrived in India.

We headed out for pre-dinner drinks at 6.30pm before walking to the Blue Elephant Restaurant for dinner. Ren opted for the vegetable noodles while I had the fish curry. The curry was hot and the fish was fresh – straight from the Bay of Bengal. The food was fantastic, and our beer was served in huge metal tumblers (alcohol wasn’t meant to be served, so beer bottles were not to be left on the table). We finished our meal around 8.30pm and wandered back to the hotel in the balmy evening air. We were leaving Mahabalipuram in the morning and heading to Pondicherry, so we decided on an early night.

SHE SAID...
Even though we officially stopped in Chennai (formerly called Madras), it was just a stepping stone on the way to Mamallapuram (also called Mahabalipuram) which was two hours away by minibus. We arrived on the overnight train from Mysore at the crack of dawn – well, 7am – but it felt like the crack of dawn. The Chennai train station was a mass of teaming humanity, and it looked and felt like something out of a post-apocalyptic film. Masses of people were camped on the floor, covered from head to toe in blankets, and even more were trying to move around the sleeping bodies, or simply hanging about. Everyone was waiting...clearly waiting for trains...but my tired mind’s eye thought it saw a more ominous motive. I needed more sleep!

We headed to Emarald Hotel for a quick buffet breakfast. I thought I couldn't even consider having anything more than a cup of tea. However, when I got there and saw the breakfast buffet, I felt a ravenous hunger come over me. Guess who had steaming pittu (rice flour and coconut rolled into cous cous like balls and steamed in a cylindrical shape) with rajma curry (black
five rathas
peas in a thick gravy sauce), dosa (thin pancakes made from fermented rice and black lentils batter) with coconut chutney, and a freshly fried egg with toast to go with their cup of tea? Of course, the boys didn't let me live that one down. 😊

Chennai was humming on that Friday morning, even though (or maybe because) it was a public holiday for the Pongal Festival. The minibus took us through the city, which was lined with advertising boards – mainly for a heavily moustachioed man who seemed to be running for office. There was evidence of a thriving economy – it is one of the Indian cities which has benefited greatly from the IT and Call Centre boom. The cars were flashy, the hotels and restaurants looked upmarket, the buildings were large and the gardens were manicured. The young women were noticeably more cosmopolitan in the way they dressed and the sari-ed women were in a minority. However, the slums along the river were hard to miss and the whiff of sewerage was the worst it's been on this trip so far. But given that Chennai is the fourth biggest city in India (after Mumbai, Kolkata and
shore temple
Delhi), it's not that surprising.

We drove along the foreshore where a sea-misty Indian Ocean was the background for a popular but drab beach front area. We continued on to Mamallapuram along a coastal road besieged with hotels. As we drove away from the big city, I could feel the city hum starting to dwindle – the shops got smaller, the cars got older and the mammoth advertising boards decreased in size and number. However, the humidity and temperature started to increase exponentially. The roadside became one long stretch of just-harvested rice fields, which were now filled with grazing cattle and cranes fighting over the grains of rice dropped by the harvesters. I slept for most of the two hour minibus drive, so I don't have much more to share about that journey.

Hotel Mahabs in Mamallapuram was just lovely and right in the centre of town. The rooms were old-school, but they were large and came with a welcome balcony – and we promptly lowered the tone of the neighbourhood by hanging our laundry on it. We were surrounded by beautiful trees which unfortunately supplied a brilliant environment for mosquitoes, so the mosquito repellent got a good
shore temple
workout.

Mamallapuram has ancient origins, and it is sold as being a laid-back town with nice beaches, good restaurants and intricately carved architecture from the 7th Century. Modern day Mamallapuram is a tiny town, mostly supported by tourism due to the group of World Heritage-listed stone temples in it. So as you would expect, there are lots of touts about.

We were supposed to wait until the heat of the day had subsided, but Karni thought the weather wasn't too bad, so at 11am we ventured out for a cycling tour of the World Heritage-listed collection of 7th and 8th Century temples and stone architecture. Our bikes looked like 1960’s models with loose handlebars and questionable brakes. Even though the round trip was only 7km, I don’t ride very often and I wasn’t sure about riding through the town on an ancient bike...especially in traffic with trucks, cars, motorbikes, cows and massive groups of people wandering around celebrating Pongal. But I had a sudden case of FOMO (fear of missing out) and decided to do it. I was also safe in the knowledge that Andrew and Kim were happy to shepherd me (thanks guys!).

The first stop
streets of mamallapuram
was at The Five Rathas (Five Chariots) which illustrates early South Indian Dravidian architecture. These are five monolithic structures, each carved from a single piece of solid pink granite, and each sculpted in a different style. There is a theory that this was part of a sculpture school and that they were scale models (based on wooden chariots) for full scale temples. A lot of literature refers to the Rathas as temples, but they were never finished and therefore never consecrated.

A few minutes away, on the edge of the sea, sat the Shore Temple. Given the complete lack of any recognisable road rules, I found negotiating the streams of traffic a challenge. The only road rule at play seemed to be that whoever was smaller and/or blinked first, lost (and that was me most of the time). Surprisingly, it was more of a challenge navigating the meandering people than the traffic, especially when we had to cross a market full of them to get to the Shore Temple. By now I was so hot that rivulets of sweat had begun to wind their way down my back, and I was struggling to stay on the bike at such
arjuna’s penance
slow speeds.

The Shore Temple was built with blocks of cut granite. The temple is a combination of three shrines – the main shrine and a small second shrine are dedicated to Shiva, while a small third shrine (between the other two) is dedicated to a reclining Vishnu. The pillars and carvings have sadly been eroded by the salt from high tides and occasional floods. There are numerous mandapams (carved pillars in front of temples) still remaining. There are theories that this temple was part of a ‘Seven Pagoda’ complex, and that all but this one have been eroded by the elements or submerged by the sea. We were on the shores of the Coromandel Coast of the Bay of Bengal, and this area was hit by the tsunami in 2004. It is a World Heritage site now, and the temple is protected by sea wall defences.

Next we braved more crowds through another market area and congested roads to a massive open air bas-relief wall frieze known as Arjuna’s Penance (or Descent of the Ganges). The frieze is carved in amazing detail on two pink granite rocks with a cleft in the middle. A collecting pool at
krishna’s butterball
the top of the rocks was designed to cause water to cascade down the cleft – supposedly signifying the Ganges coming down from heaven. The carved scenes have many interpretations, but the most loved theory is that it depicts Arjuna (a figure standing on one leg) doing penance for a favour from Shiva. The other common theory is that the figure is Bhagiratha doing penance to bring down the Ganges to earth for the prosperity and happiness of the people. Either way, the bas-relief carving was beautiful, especially the detailed depictions of kings, holy men, sinful men, nagas (serpent gods), birds, elephants and other animals.

The Tamil people from this region were often referred to as the Venetians of the 3rd – 8th Centuries. They travelled into the SE Asian peninsula spreading the Hindu religion as they went. As a result, the carvings in the temples here are similar in style to those of Angkor Wat in Cambodia, but not on the same mammoth scale.

The big draw card of the area is Krishna’s Butterball, a huge granite boulder that is precariously and improbably perched on a sloping rock face – completely defying gravity. It was a pretty
masala calamari and chips
amazing sight, and even though it has sat there for eons, I didn’t completely trust that it wouldn’t suddenly dislodge itself and roll towards us like some sort of giant bowling ball (I read a lot of Asterix comics as a child). The lawns surrounding the area were full of big groups of families having lunch in the shade of the large trees. The day was getting hotter, and by the time we got back to our bikes, I realised the layers of sweat, sunscreen and insect repellent on the exposed skin of my neck and arms had acquired a film of road dust. I don’t think I’ve ever experienced ‘gritty’ arms before.

We cycled back to the bike hire shop and that was the end of the bike tour. As much as I was glad to be no longer riding in crazy public holiday Indian traffic, it would have been nice to have had a longer bike ride – perhaps on the network of quiet back streets that radiated off the main drag (rather than on the main road itself). I’m glad I didn’t chicken out of the bike ride and catch an auto rickshaw (motorised tricycle with
mamallapuram beach
a passenger cabin), although I had one small moment of panic when a guy walked out in front of me (talking on his phone) and I swerved into a parked car. The guy happened to be the owner of the car and thankfully thought it was hilarious. What was more hilarious was that when I was telling Kim what that happened, I ran straight into the back of Lee... Ah. Good times.

Andrew and I don't like crowds much, so we really should have avoided being in India during a festival. More to the point, we probably should have avoided India all together! But in the hope of experiencing as wide a cross section of humanity as possible, here we were.

We walked to Santana Restaurant on the beach for lunch. While travelling in India, we’d decided to be as vegetarian as possible, but we were making exceptions with seafood in coastal towns. So for lunch I ordered masala calamari which came with chips! This was our first Indian-western fusion meal, and I have to admit it was fabulous. I couldn’t believe I got a side order of chips, but there you go – it’s not all rice
mamallapuram beach
in South India.

We were sitting on the top floor of the restaurant with a warm Indian Ocean scented breeze blowing through the open windows of the restaurant. From where we were sitting, we had a good view of the beach below us, including the passing parade of Indian families, groups of young men and herds of cows. It was both cute and slightly weird to see that cows liked the beach.

Given the restaurant only sold beers, Kim and I ordered lemonade and made ourselves a shandy. Brian had never had one before, and he seems to have discovered a new favourite drink.

The beach wasn’t really set up for lounging about, but Andrew and Lee wanted to swim in the Bay of Bengal, so after lunch we found a space on the far end of the beach that wasn't occupied by cows or groups of young guys. The water wasn’t as warm as it looked, but it was quite pleasant (although the water was warm to Andrew who is used to surfing in freezing Tasmanian waters). Andrew was persistently followed by a guy selling necklaces and bracelets, and in the end Andrew relented and bought
stone carvings
a beaded necklace and two bracelets. Initially I wasn’t happy about rewarding the persistent seller – but the bracelets were quite cute. Cute enough that I stole one for myself. 😊

We walked back along the main street to the shady coolness of our hotel. There were the usual shops selling beach sarongs and trinkets, but there were also a number of stone-carving galleries and workshops. However, we didn’t shop as much as I thought we would – we couldn’t be bothered fending off the pushy touts.

I probably would have liked Mamallapuram a whole lot more (despite the stifling heat) if not for the disproportionate number of super-persistent touts and beggars. I think it was even more noticeable because it was a small place.

The hotel swimming pool provided a great hangout space for most of the boys, while Kim and I reclined in the shade with an adult beverage delivered to us by Lee – so spoilt! Damien and Brian had ended up in a lovely (honeymoon!) suite with a large enclosed balcony, so we gathered there for pre-dinner drinks. I must have got a bit too much sun on the bike ride, as I
fish curry and rice
was feeling very tired and slightly hot and bothered. However, an hour of sitting outside on a balmy night soon made me feel better.

We had dinner at The Blue Elephant along the path to the beach, which was well known for its seafood dishes. Andrew ordered a fiery fish curry. However, given I wasn’t feeling 100%, I ordered from the bland side of the menu – fried vegetarian noodles – which were surprisingly delicious and exactly what my stomach wanted!

As we walked back from the restaurant, I noticed that the town had a very different feel. The traffic had subsided, the touts had gone home and the temperature was very pleasant for walking. This was more like the laid-back seaside town I had been expecting.

This was a quick stop over in Mamallapuram with the main aim to visit the ancient architectural sites. However, if we had stayed a few more days (and had been able to avoid the pushy touts), I think I may have started to understand what attracted so many western hippies here.

Next we travel south along the coast to the former French colony of Pondicherry.

mudumalai national park
HE SAID...
We were leaving Ooty and travelling north to Mudumalai National Park. We woke at 6.30am in our freezing bedroom and headed out for a warming chai(tea) on the street at our favourite local chai shop (Shri Ragavendra Bangalore Iyengar’s Bakery and Sweets). We jumped into our minibus at 9am and headed off on our journey to the small town of Masinagudi.

It was a very steep descent out of mountains, and it was a fantastic drive. We had to negotiate 36 hairpin bends, and there were countless signs saying how many car accidents had occurred on each particular stretch of road. A few signs even had a running tally of how many people had died. This wasn’t the best reading for those who don’t like steep drops without guard rails. Ren had banned me from watching a TV program called “World’s Most Dangerous Roads” before we came to India – I can now see why! Luckily we had a fantastic driver who knew the road inside out, and he drove very carefully (slowing to a crawl on some particularly tight corners). There was also hardly any traffic, which made a big difference. There was one occasion when the
bison valley viewing point
driver did worry me. We were on a steep and narrow stretch of road when all of a sudden he pointed and said “elephant”. On the other side of the valley – possibly a kilometre away – he had spotted a few wild elephants grazing on the steep hillside. He stopped on the roadside for us to take a few long zoom photos. Ren was so happy to see a wild elephant, but I just wanted the driver to concentrate more on the road and less on the periphery wildlife!

We had a short photo stop at the Bison Valley viewing point before continuing on to Jungle Retreat, our accommodation in Mudumalai National Park. We arrived at 10.30am, dropped our bags in the dormitory we were sharing with eight others and dived into the cold pool that a few goats were drinking from. We sat in the hot sun, sipped cold beer and took in the stunning view of Mt Nilgiri towering above us. This place was so incredibly relaxing!

We had a buffet lunch at 1.30pm that comprised vegetarian spring rolls, spinach with dahl (lentils), rajma curry (black eyed beans in a thick gravy sauce), beetroot porail
jungle retreat
(beetroot stir-fried in mustard and topped with grated coconut), roast potatoes, mutton curry (goat is referred to as mutton in India), fried chicken, watermelon raita (savoury watermelon yoghurt), rice and chapatti. I had everything from the buffet and went back three times – piglet! We finished lunch at 2.30pm, headed back to the pool and bathed in the sun.

Coffee and biscuits were served at 4.30pm, and at 5.30pm we jumped into an open-top jeep for a two hour ‘safari’ of the surrounding forested areas. ‘Safari’ is being used loosely here, because we didn’t leave the bitumen once. However, we saw Indian bison, wild boar, monkeys, birds, sambar deer and spotted deer. There was a whispered possibility that we would see an elephant, but that quickly evaporated when we saw how many other open-top jeeps were driving around with tourists on ‘safari’. On the way back to our idyllic Jungle Retreat we picked up some beer and apple vodka from a heavily fortified bottle shop in one of the local villages.

At 8pm we sat through a presentation by one of the Jungle Retreat owners on the flora and fauna of the area, and how they had regenerated
jungle retreat
the previous agricultural land over an 18 year period to create a forest.

Immediately following the presentation, we sat down to a buffet dinner at 8.30pm. We had kofta curry (meatball curry), fish curry, urud dahl (black lentils), onion rings, boondi raita (tiny fried chickpea flour balls with yoghurt), steamed vegetables, baby potatoes, roast chicken and butter rice. It was unbelievably good!

After dinner we sat around a small bonfire drinking beer, whisky and vodka under the stars until 11pm, and then headed to our 10-bed dormitory to crash. It had been a fantastic travel day.

The next day we were leaving Mudumalai National Park and travelling north to Mysore. We woke at 6.30am, shared the three showers and toilets in the ten-person dormitory and headed out at 7.30am for a cultural walk around the local village area. We walked to the top of a solitary hill where a shrine to Shiva had been built, and it provided a stunning 360 degree view around the local villages. The view from the top of the hill was incredible, especially the breathtaking view of Mt Nilgiri in the early morning sun.

We retraced our steps back to Jungle
jungle retreat
Retreat and arrived at 9.30am. We were hungry and breakfast looked fantastic. We sat down to idlis (steamed cakes made from fermented rice and lentil batter) with sambar (thin vegetable curry), masala dosa (a dosa stuffed with a creamy mix of lightly cooked potatoes, onions, green chilli and spices), banana pancakes, eggs and coffee. It was incredible, and just what we needed after a two hour walk. We reluctantly left Jungle Retreat at 10.30am and continued our northward journey, this time heading for Mysore.



SHE SAID...
We woke up much earlier than we needed to, and the Ooty morning air was clear but cold – perfect weather for an early morning chai (tea). We walked past people cleaning the streets, children in uniforms heading off to school and merchants slowly opening their shops. We went back to the chai wallah (tea seller) from the day before and had a quick but delicious glass of chai while standing in the sun like all the locals. Back at the hotel, we packed hurriedly and piled into two separate six-seater four wheel drive cars. We were heading to the foothills of the Nilgiris Mountains where we were hoping to spot
mudumalai national park
some wildlife in the jungles of Mudumalai National Park.

After the long and winding road we'd used on our upward journey into Ooty, we were now taking a shorter but steeper route down from Ooty - which had 36 hairpin bends on a narrow road! The good news was that the views were spectacular, we had a great driver, and our car had Lee, Kim, Damien, Brian and us...we travelled really well together and were never short of a joke that usually had us in stitches.

Around one of those hairpin bends, we stopped at a lookout point for beautiful views of the valleys and mountains surrounding us. We also witnessed a large local bus charging down the hairpin bends as if it was the size of a scooter. It made us feel rather queasy on behalf of the passengers in there.

As we descended further into the valley, our driver suddenly excitedly pointed into a distant hill where a wild elephant was grazing. It took us a few minutes to see it, so we were very impressed that our driver had spotted it. And as excited as I was to see the wild elephant munching its
mudumalai national park
way through a tree, I would have much preferred that the driver's eyes were firmly on the road!

Once we hit flat ground, the surroundings changed from cool luscious green to hot and humid arid brown. We drove deeper into the jungle and passed a large arched sign that announced the beginning of Mudumalai National Park.

After driving for around two hours, it was early afternoon when we arrived at the tiny town of Masinagudi, and turned down a track towards the Jungle Retreat adjacent to Mudumalai National Park. Set against the peaks of the enchanting Nilgiri ranges, Mudumalai National Park was picturesque beyond words. It used to be the Mysore Maharaja’s private hunting ground, but was brought into India’s Project Tiger in 1974, and it’s now supposed to be one of the best game sanctuaries in India to observe diverse wildlife.

At the family run Jungle Retreat, we were greeted by Rhea and Smriti. Although simple, the Retreat is stunningly positioned under the mountains, built of local materials and in colours that make it blend into the surrounds beautifully. There was a bar and dining area, recreational facilities, a variety of accommodation including small cottages, a
mudumalai national park
few fabulous looking tree houses and a dormitory style block. We were in the dormitory area which was large and comfortable. There were adjacent shower and toilet facilities to our room, but they were somewhat open to the elements.

Before we could go exploring, there was a safety briefing to sit through. Given we were in the middle of a National Park, there were no fences and therefore no way to stop wildlife from entering the Retreat. We were warned against walking between our dormitory and the other public areas after dark if we didn’t have a guard escort. The owners of the Retreat had set up motion-sensor cameras around the property, and later that evening they showed us a selection of the images that had been captured, including elephants, leopards and wild boar (the most likely, dangerous and unpredictable animal we would come across). In light of our safety briefing, those fabulously isolated cabins and tree houses weren't looking so inviting now.

The Retreat came with six family dogs and three cats. One of the tabby cats was extremely friendly and very talkative, and she followed us around. At one point she made herself at home on
mudumalai national park
Andrew's bed while we were getting dressed, which made me miss Mia very much. Of the dogs, there was 14 year old blind and deaf Gunda who just slept in the sun outside the dining room, three very playful dogs (my favourites being Scooter and Spud), a very playful young puppy who didn't stop long enough for me to see its name, and one black dog who didn't like hanging out with the guests.

Before lunch there was time for some lounging about at the infinity pool built into the rocks – the pool was so lovely looking that even I couldn’t resist sitting in it. The afternoon was hot and humid, and the pool could have been easily mistaken for a mirage amidst the cacti, spindly brush and sandy dry soil... with the mountains framing the picture. The local herds of goats and cows used the pool as a drinking pond, which should have grossed me out, but strangely it didn't.

All meals at the Retreat were served buffet-style, and they were all incredibly delicious. For lunch we had vegetarian spring rolls, spinach with dahl (lentils), rajma curry (black eyed beans in a thick gravy sauce), beetroot
mudumalai national park
porail (beetroot stir-fried in mustard, and topped with grated coconut), rasam (sour tamarind soup), roast potatoes, mutton curry (goat is referred to as mutton in India), fried chicken, watermelon raita (savoury watermelon yoghurt), rice and chapatti. As mentioned in our previous blog on Ooty, we had planned on being vegetarian on the inland sections of this trip. However, the meat dishes looked so good and were being cooked by the Retreat's chef, so we made an exception. My favourite dishes were the beetroot porail and watermelon raita with rice. Dessert was a trifle of sorts (without the jelly component).

After lunch we went back to the pool and sat around before our afternoon safari drive. By the time we got into the three safari jeeps at 5pm, it had started to cool down to a pleasant temperature. Having grown up in Africa, it’s a little strange for me that my first safari experience was in India. We’d barely begun the safari when one of the jeeps had to turn back to the closest village as Francis had succumbed to a stomach bug. The first among the group to go down...

Andrew and I were in a jeep with
mudumalai national park
Brian, Damien and Karni. We were on the lookout for tigers and leopards but actually only saw Indian bison, sambar deer (they are huge!), herds of spotted deer, wild boar, a little rabbit, grey langur monkeys, birds and fabulous old world trees. The best hope of finding a tiger was apparently to listen for alarm calls from animals in the park, then stop the jeep in a likely place and wait silently in the hope that the tiger chooses to pass our way. I wasn't convinced by this method. Why would any self-respecting tiger choose to cross a road right near a bunch of safari jeeps with humans and their clicking cameras? It wasn’t looking good for tiger spotting. Despite not seeing a single tiger or elephant, driving slowly around an Indian forest in jeeps was in itself such a great experience that I almost didn’t care. Almost.

As much I used to tease my Dad about his chocolate brown safari suit from the 1980s, I wish safari suits were still in so I could have sported one and gone on safari in style. But in this age of practicality all we needed were sunglasses, a hat, sunscreen, water,
village in mudumalai national park
a warmer top for when the sun went down and the all-important camera. Foot wear was a non-issue because for the majority of time we were just sitting in our safari jeep. The open safari jeep was heaps of fun, but also very cold on the drive back.

We stopped in Masinagudi on the way back to buy some alcohol as the Retreat wasn't really big on carrying a lot of stock. When we got back to the Retreat, a bonfire had already been lit. We sat in front of it with a drink until dinner was ready. Kim and I have found a revoltingly sweet vodka called Magic Moments which we have chosen to make our adult drink of choice in India. One of the other guests (from Hyderabad) played Neil Diamond from his iPod... it wasn't as cheesy as it sounds. Ok it was. But we didn’t care.

Dinner was another buffet. We had kofta curry (meatball curry), fish curry, urud dahl (black lentils), onion rings, boondi raita (tiny fried chickpea flour balls with yoghurt), steamed vegetables, baby potatoes, roast chicken and butter rice. Dessert was banoffee pie! It wasn’t the traditional English dessert I had
village in mudumalai national park
envisaged – but it had the required elements of bananas, toffee and cream.

We continued to sit around the bonfire after dinner, and were joined by Rhea from reception who eventually (and very politely) told us when we had to wrap things up. We had to get a guard to walk us back to our lodgings. Some of the group were already in bed, so it was a case of being very quiet while we showered and got ready for bed - a bit hard to do when you've got the giggles. The cold shower quickly knocked all the giggles right out of me though. The cold shower had also made me wide awake, so I lay in the narrow creaky bed for a long time trying hard not to be a wriggle pot and wake everyone up.

The dogs barked a few times through the night which was a sign that there were wild animals around. The only other night-time excitement was when someone (who shall remain nameless) nearly ‘accidently’ climbed into an already occupied bed on their return from the bathroom. We will never know the real truth. 😊

We woke up at 6:30am to
village in mudumalai national park
join a two hour guided village walk at 7pm. Andrew, Damien, Brian, Francis, Anja and I walked out of the Retreat gate before it was fully light. On the way I looked back towards the Retreat and the mist clad peaks of the mountain range behind it were just starting to glisten with the first rays of the sun. My favourite doggies Scooter and Spud accompanied the group and provided protection against the village dogs, wandering cows and any other animals they deemed to be a danger to us. The two young guides who led us didn't say a single word, so it was more an escorted walk than a guided walk.

The sun was shining, we were far enough from any city that the air was fresh (but smoky from an occasional cooking fire), and it was so good to be walking again. We made good time walking across fields and across villages, but the pace slowed right down when we hit a very steep hill with a temple on top.

At the top of the hill the view was fabulous, but the little Shiva temple was closed. We sat in the shade of the temple and
village in mudumalai national park
regained our breath when Andrew realised that one of the young guides had set up the binoculars a bit further up the hill on a rocky outcrop. In all honesty I was quite happy to stay where I was, but eventually everyone drifted up there, so I followed. How glad I was that I did! Scooter had hung back at the temple with me, and now walked over and stood on the very edge of the rocks looking down at the vast plains of the National Park below us. It provided a photo opportunity for my favourite photo of the trip to-date.

The walk proved to be a real highlight! We saw an eagle (or a similar looking bird of prey), several other exotically feathered things that I couldn’t name, huge brightly coloured Malabar squirrels and a few monkeys. The two villages we walked through seemed to be geared towards cattle rearing and also had lovely fenced vegetable gardens.

We eventually returned to the Jungle Retreat where people were just sitting down to breakfast. Some of the group had gone on a bird watching walk, while others had skipped all the early morning activities.

I was ravenous,
village in mudumalai national park
so breakfast was very welcome. I had eggs on toast and a banana pancake, while Andrew had idlis (steamed cakes made from fermented rice and lentil batter) with sambar (thin vegetable curry) and a masala dosa (a dosa stuffed with a creamy mix of lightly cooked potatoes, onions, green chilli and spices).

The setting and quiet beauty of the Jungle Retreat was fantastic, and I would highly recommend this spot to anyone who wanted to have a low key jungle experience. I will miss the food, the relaxing atmosphere of sitting around the pool and the family dogs and cats!

Next we travel north to the city of Mysore in Karnataka.

HE SAID...
We woke early at 5am, once again beating the 5.30am call to prayer. We had a long travel day (seven and a half hours) ahead, as we were leaving Kochi and travelling north to Ooty (or Ootacamund as it appears on most maps). We sat down to a plate of dosa (thin pancakes made from fermented rice and black lentils batter) with coconut chutney for breakfast at 7am. Bowls of fresh bananas and watermelon were on the table, and I had a pot of masala chai (spiced sweet milky tea) while Ren had a tea. It was a great start to the day.

We left our Fort Kochi homestay (Kaliveedu Lodge) at 7.45am and headed to the Ernakulam train station for the first of our two travel legs to Ooty – a four hour train trip followed by a three and a half hour bus trip. The train station was reasonably small and easy to negotiate. The train was dilapidated with basic toilets, but we were lucky to be in a second class cabin with air conditioning. Wallahs (sellers) carrying coffee, chai (tea), rice with curries and deep fried snacks were walking through the cabins selling their wares,
dosa with coconut chutney and pickle
and I acclimatised myself to their incessant yelling of “biryani, biryani, biryani” and “chai, chai, chai” over the next four hours. We left Kochi at 9am and embarked on our long journey north.

I grabbed a masala chai from one of the chai wallahs (tea sellers) at 10.30am and it was fantastic. The gentle rocking of the train was mesmerising, and I began to drift in and out of sleep and in and out of the numerous conversations of people around me until all I could hear was the distant white noise of voices.

We arrived at Coimbatore train station at 1pm, jumped into a minibus and travelled 15 minutes to Sree Annapoorna / Sree Gowrishankar, our lunch stop. It was a fantastic place, and we had unlimited rice and curries for $1.70 AUD (the spicy dahl was the highlight). This is how I’d always imagined Indian food. We ordered the ‘South Indian Meal’, which arrived on a large round thali plate with rice in the middle and a number of different curries in small metal bowls around the outside The curries were dahl (lentils) with ghee (clarified butter), sambar (thin vegetable curry), special kulambu (spicy dhal based
train to coimbatore
gravy), rasam (spicy tamarind broth), kootu (mixed vegetables in dhal sauce), curd (yoghurt), lime pickle and rice payasam (rice pudding with brown molasses, coconut milk, spices, cashews and raisins). The plate was topped with a gigantic appalam (pappadam). The waiting staff walked around replenishing each curry as soon you finished eating it, so you didn’t get the feeling that you were close to finishing your meal. Your plate always looked like you hadn’t started eating. We were in a noisy rest stop on the side of a busy road, and we were the only non-locals. We were in travel heaven.

We finished the meal at 2pm and had to cross a very busy road to get to the minibus. We were crossing together and the majority of traffic had stopped, but one rogue motor bike was speeding through on the outside lane and Ren (who was in front) didn’t see him coming. We screamed, Ren stopped and the motorbike screeched to a halt only centimetres from her feet. Disaster averted!

We jumped in the minibus and started the second leg of our journey to the hill town of Ooty. We passed through highly populated city areas until we
thali meal
slowly transitioned into rural India. The traffic madness began to subside and less and less people lined the roadside. Mountains loomed in front of us, and I knew we had a long and winding road ahead. We’d been travelling since 9am, and I began to wish I was still on the morning train (train travel is far more comfortable than sitting in a minibus climbing a mountain road).

We had a quick stop around 3pm before setting off on our final assault on Ooty. We had another two hours of this spectacular (and at times terrifying) ascent into the greenery of Tamil Nadu’s higher plateau. We met public buses driving at break-neck speeds and we passed slow trucks on blind corners with steep drop-offs and no guard rails. We also had to stop for a wild elephant who had settled down in the middle of the road. The traffic build up was incredible, so a group of truck and bus drivers tried to persuade him/her to walk a few metres to the steep terrain off the side of the road. When our wild elephant finally decided to move, we continued through palm and banana plantations as we climbed to
streets of ooty
the hill station of Ooty (which is 2240 metres above sea level).

We finally arrived at Hotel Nahar Nilgiris at 5.30pm. It was cold – really cold – and the hotel room was icy. I quickly showered and piled on as many clothes as I could manage. It was hard to believe that nine hours ago we had been sweltering in the morning heat of Kochi.

We walked to Hotel Alagapuri Bar for some very welcome pre-dinner drinks. This was without doubt, one of the seediest bars I’ve ever been in, but it was fantastic. A friendly guy served our drinks and made sure we had finger snacks on our table. It was very dark inside the tiny bar (which was ironically called a family bar), but our eyes acclimatised and we recovered from the day’s travels with lukewarm local beer. We eventually headed around the corner to the ‘Non-Veg’ Hotel Durga and ordered from the ‘Veg’ Spice Restaurant menu, where we shared an aloo gobi masala (potato and cauliflower curry) with naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) and chapathis (unleavened whole wheat flour flat bread, cooked on a dry skillet). It was fantastic.

We walked back to the hotel in the cold night air and settled into the hotel lobby. A fellow traveller had some whiskey which we all shared, but the night manager informed us that the consumption of alcohol was not allowed in the hotel, so we wrapped up the night and headed to our icy cold room. It had been a long but enjoyable travel day, and we were well and truly ready for bed.

The previous travel day had taken its toll – we slept in! We woke at 6.30am to a freezing cold room. We walked out into the brisk morning air and wandered around the streets of Ooty. A few locals were standing around a tiny street shop, and they called us over. We had a glass of chai on the street at Shri Ragavendra Bangalore Iyengar’s Bakery and Sweets. They were very friendly and the chai was very welcome and warming. We headed back to the hotel for breakfast at Hotel Nahar Nilgiris restaurant. I had the set dosa (dosa with coconut chutney, sambar, tomato and coriander curries) with cardamom chai (cardamom spiced tea), and it was fantastic.

At 9am we jumped into a
hills of ooty
minibus and headed to the Highfield Tea Factory in Coonoor. On our way were drove through a military training facility, and I was intrigued by the mix of military and tourist advertising banners that lined the road. We arrived at the tea factory at 10am and wandered around the plantation before touring the factory itself. At the end of the tour we sampled a few tea varieties and picked up a packet of premium tea, a bag of ginger sweets and a bag of sugared fennel sweets (often offered in a small bowl at the end of a meal). We jumped back into the minibus at 11.30am and headed to the Coonoor train station to catch what the locals referred to as a ‘toy train’ back to Ooty. We picked up some samosas (fried conical pastries filled with spiced potatoes and peas) and masala chai on the platform while we waited, and they were surprisingly good. We clambered onto the train at 12.30pm for our scenic trip back to Ooty, arriving at Udhagamandalam station at 1.45pm. We walked to the entrance of the Botanical Gardens and had a lemon tea at Kashali Cafe before heading into the gardens. The gardens
chai wallah
were a little unkempt, but they were tranquil and had a great family atmosphere. We wandered through the markets outside the garden gates before walking back to the main township of Ooty.

We had a quick drink at our favourite family bar (Hotel Alagapuri Bar) before jumping into auto rickshaws (motorised tricycles with a passenger cabin) and heading out to dinner at the Fortune Resort Hotel. One of our fellow travellers (Damien from Ireland) was celebrating his 50th birthday, so we picked up a cake on the way. Balancing a decorated cake on my knees in an auto rickshaw on a bumpy road with two other people is not easy. The resort restaurant was comfortable and plush. I had the tandoori aloo (potatoes stuffed with cashews, green chillies and coriander and baked in a tandoor oven) and Ren had the kadai ke karishme (Indian cottage cheese, mushrooms and mixed vegetables in spicy tomato onion gravy) which we shared with rice and naans.

It was a cold trip back to the hotel in the auto rickshaw, so we gathered in Damien’s bedroom for a whiskey, as we were unable to drink alcohol in the lobby (which had an open
dosa with sambars and chutneys
fire). Turning 50 is a big milestone, and it had been great to share it with Damien in Ooty.



SHE SAID...
It was an early start in Kochi, but as usual the various muezzins in the mosque minarets meant our alarm was not needed. We were leaving the hot and humid coastal city of Fort Kochi in Kerala and travelling north to one of India’s more famous hill stations, Ootacamund in Tamil Nadu. Ootacamund or Ooty is one of the three hill stations in the Nilgiri ranges (Blue Mountains) and has much colder weather.

The Kaliveedu Lodge breakfast of dosas (thin pancakes made from fermented rice and black lentils batter, cooked on a griddle) with creamy coconut chutney and a dollop of spicy pickle was delicious. It was a bit of a rushed breakfast, as I had been too tired to pack the night before and now I only had 15 minutes before we left for the station.

Our packs were loaded onto a convoy of cars for the 30 minute trip from the Kaliveedu Lodge to the train station in Ernakulam, which is on the Kochi mainland. We were catching a train for the
wellington lookout
four hour trip to Coimbatore. It was a Sunday morning and the station wasn’t overly busy at 9am. The train was already on the platform and we boarded straight away.

We travelled in the train’s second class with AC chair carriage. It was comfortable and clean-ish. Once the train had started moving the aircon kicked into overdrive and I had to do my best impersonation of an Eskimo with my hoodie and scarf to keep warm. What is with Asia's confusion with air conditioning and refrigerant??

The train was full of action – there were wallahs (sellers) constantly walking up and down the carriage aisles offering chai (tea), coffee, cold drinks, vadais (fried savoury lentils fritters), biryani (dish of spiced rice and meat or vegetables) and other snacks. We were still full from breakfast so we didn't buy any snacks, but I was very tempted. We bought a chai which was totally delicious and only 7 rupees for a small cup. After I caught up on my notes, I napped for a little while as the train snaked itself into the hills. Between naps, people watching and the wallahs with their calls of chai-chai-chai and kopi-kopi-kofffeeeee, the trip
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
went very quickly.

We arrived in Coimbatore at 1pm and transferred to a small non-AC minibus for the three hour drive to Ootacamund. We first drove through the outskirts of Coimbatore and the roads were a concrete construction maze.

We stopped for lunch at a roadside restaurant on the edge of the city, part of the Annapoorna chain. It was a vast cafeteria, and the service was very quick. We all ordered the vegetarian thali meals, which made us realise we'd been having the sanitised/tourist versions of it in Kochi. This was the real deal. A thali meal involves a large circular tin plate filled up with various versions of dhal (lentils), spicy vegetable curries, curd, pickles, pappadams and rice. We were free to devour the dishes in whatever way we preferred (and devoured we did!). The unique thing about this meal was the waiters who walked around the restaurant, constantly adding more curries onto the plate... and there was also a steady flow of rice. I’d read and heard of thali meals, but no one had mentioned the free flowing food.

Apart from having seafood and fish curries in Kochi (on the west coast) and Mamallapurum
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
(when we get to the east coast), we had decided to be vegetarian on this trip in India. When vegetarian meals are cooked so well, it's so easy to be vegetarian. After that fantastic meal, we continued our journey.

We have been on many scary roads throughout Asia, but comparatively I would have to say that one has not experienced the true meaning of ‘terrifying’ until one has travelled on the roads of India! The roads themselves are not in bad condition; it’s just that the drivers are beyond crazy! The minibus drove through small villages and farmlets as it made its way towards the Nilgiri Hills. The road started getting curvy, and then turned into a tortuous series of hairpin bends up into the hills towards Ootacamund. The view was stunning, but I kept my eyes on the road as the minibus wound back and forth, overtaking trucks and jeeps on blind corners at every opportunity with an ever-present soundtrack of honking of horns. There was a large sign forbidding speeding around corners, and it was dented and nearly bent in two, quite possibly by a vehicle hurtling around that corner. Oh the irony. The trip was exciting,
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
thrilling, downright scary and slightly sickening all at once.

The trip was supposed to take three hours but took a bit longer due to the traffic we encountered when we had to stop for a wild elephant on the road. The poor elephant had probably been trying to cross the hilly road but couldn't due to the constant stream of traffic in both directions. By the time we got to the part of the road where it was, it had gone down an embankment and looked stuck, dazed and confused – but was still munching away on some leaves. We also saw a lot of monkeys – bonnet macaques – who were casually strolling along the road, seemingly not thinking that the cars and trucks were a threat.

Ootacamund is commonly known as Ooty, and when it was a British hill station it was known as Snooty Ooty (it is thought that the game of snooker was named and possibly even invented here). Ooty was a popular summer retreat in the time of the British Raj, famous for exclusive polo gatherings and elite parties (thus the ‘snooty’ in snooty ooty). At first glance Ooty didn’t seem to be
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
an especially pretty town, with the usual crazy traffic, unplanned streets and random concrete buildings in various states of construction. However, there were spectacular looking tea plantations that dotted the surrounding hills, and a cool ‘Toy Train’ (miniature steam train) that ran through the Nilgiri Mountains. There were also (surprisingly) many chocolate and sweet shops. The town’s sales pitch / brochures seem to focus very heavily on its old British Hill Station notoriety, even though its street culture is decidedly Indian. We were in Tamil Nadu now, but Tamil wasn’t the only language I heard spoken, possibly because Ooty sits close to the three state borders of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Kerala.

We checked into our hotel – Hotel Nahar Nilgiris, which looked quite grand on approach. The rooms were very comfortable and large, but given it was quite cold here with no in-room heating, marble floors probably weren't the best choice of flooring in the bathrooms.

After we checked in we both had to have hot showers to thaw after the sudden chill of climbing into the mountains. We met at the lobby at 7pm for dinner, but we decided to go to dinner via a bar.
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
Finding a local bar in Ooty was no mean feat. The first one we went to was deemed too seedy, so we found ourselves at Hotel Alagapuri Bar, where Kim and I were the only females in the whole place (even in the oddly named Family Bar area). We had far more pre-dinner drinks than we had planned on having, and by the time we got to dinner at Hotel Durga we were all very happy campers. Andrew and I ordered from the ‘veg’ menu (from the restaurant next door) and shared an aloo gobi masala (potato and cauliflower curry) with naans (fluffy leavened bread traditionally cooked in a wood fired tandoor oven) and chapathis (unleavened whole wheat flour flat bread cooked on a dry skillet and then browned and puffed up on an open flame). The masala chai was one of the best we've had to date. This restaurant offered fantastic food in the most nondescript of spaces. We would never have thought to try it without Karni's inside knowledge. It was a most fabulous night with Karni, Rao, Damien, Brian, Kim and Lee – the perfect way for us to celebrate Damien's birthday eve. We'd had such a
swarmy and swarmy tea plantation
good night that we barely noticed the temperature had dropped to about two degrees as we stumbled back down the hill to our hotel.

Damien had some duty free whiskey in his pack and he had the great idea of sneakily congregating at reception for some drinks. We ordered cokes to surreptitiously get glasses and then poured shots of Jameson whiskey into them. We felt like a bunch of teenagers hiding drinks from the adults. However, we clearly didn't do a very good job, because the hotel manager came over and informed us that the hotel lobby wasn't a licensed area and we'd have to move on. It must have been our raucous laughter and thigh slapping that gave it away.

After a cold night huddled under two blankets each, we met Brian in the lobby at 7am, walked the streets and had a chai at one of the many shops lining the street. It was a very brisk morning and the locals were standing in groups wherever there was a sunny patch on the road. The chais were steaming hot and very welcome. We asked the friendly man at the chai shop where he would suggest for
highfield tea factory
breakfast, but none of his suggested eateries opened before 8:30am.

We walked back to the hotel and joined Lee, Kim and Damien for breakfast at the hotel's Garden Restaurant. I wasn't hungry and just opted for two cardamom chais (cardamom spiced teas). They were really delicious. Andrew had a dosa with the usual accompaniments of chutneys and sambars (thin vegetable curries).

We were ready for departure as scheduled at 9am. There were two six-seater four wheel drives to take us around for the day. I was excited, as it was the morning of ‘The Ooty Tea Party Day’! Well, I probably should explain – we were checking out a tea plantation and factory and catching the famous miniature Toy Train from Coonoor back to Ooty... and given my love of Alice in Wonderland-esque fancy, it seemed like a logical name for the day. Coonoor is another hill station, but it looked more densely populated than Ooty.

Our first stop was at a lookout in Wellington, a settlement between Ooty and Coonoor. There were stunning views of the lush green valley spread around us. We got back into the four wheel drives and drove to our next stop,
highfield tea factory
the nearby Swarmy and Swarmy Tea Plantation and Highfield Tea Factory.

Before I write about the tea plantation visit, I want to share something that had astounded me when I read it... India is the top consumer of tea in the world, but this wasn’t always the case. While tea is native to the subcontinent, it wasn’t until after the British had established plantations to supply the UK that the Indian tea plant was cultivated! Apparently for decades nearly all of India’s tea was exported, and it wasn’t until the late 1800s that the Indian Tea Association was formed to promote tea drinking within the country. And they’ve certainly done a good job!

Wherever we have been so far, we’ve never been far from a chai wallah (tea seller) with trays of sweet milky tea in steaming glasses. They say that each Indian region has a different way they like to drink their tea – here in the south they predominantly like their chai with just milk and sugar, double brewed with a fistful of black tea. However, influences from the northeast have brought in the masala chai (spiced sweet milky tea) which can be infused with all
toy train
or any of the following spices – ginger, clove, cardamom, cinnamon and black pepper. I have also been told that in the north they have a ginger version that is finished off with a sprinkle of pink salt or threads of saffron. I really hope I get to try that!

Anyway, back to the tea plantation visit in Coonoor. Tea plantations are set out similarly to vineyards – on steep hillsides so that there is adequate drainage. Tea plants are actually tea trees that are manicured to remain as bushes (similar to maintaining a bonsai tree but on a larger scale). Scattered among the tea bushes were white oak trees that absorb a significant amount of water during the wet season and release it in the dry season. The oak trees are also harvested for firewood.

When we got there the tea pickers were having their morning break on the slopes close to the factory. They were sitting in the shade of the tea bushes with little silver tumblers of tea. They were very accommodating about being photographed. We learnt about white, green and black tea, including their differences, benefits, qualities and tastes. The factory machinery wasn't operating
toy train
as they hadn't picked enough tea over the weekend, but we still got a tour of the plant – from sorting to drying to packaging the tea. In the depths of the factory a man was sitting on the floor in the packaging area, and he was covered in the fine orange-brown tea dust that seemed to have settled on everything in the factory.

Finally it was time to taste the products. Tea purists, you may wish to avert your eyes. The teas came in plain, masala (mixed spices), ginger or chocolate varieties. There was an expensive white tea as well, but they weren’t handing out freebies of that one. The chocolate tea was surprisingly good (made by mixing cocoa into the leaves), but the masala tea and ginger tea were not that brilliant. We bought some black tea to take home with us for elevenses. 😊

We were then dropped off at Coonoor Station for the Toy Train ride. There were several small blue carriages lined on the very narrow tracks, looking as if they were waiting for the Fat Controller to arrive. Our little nephew who loves Thomas the Tank Engine would have been in heaven.
botanical gardens
We took advantage of the platform catering service... one beaming chai wallah was doing a roaring trade in drinks and food out of a little stall. I thought I was buying one samosa (fried conical pastries filled with spiced potatoes and peas) for 20 rupees, but turned out I got a pack of five for 20 rupees! And they were delicious.

The Toy Train is apparently usually packed, but when the little blue train pulled into the station, at least two carriages were completely empty. We settled into the hour-long ride to Ooty with one half of the carriage taken up by a group visiting from Hyderabad. We were as fascinated by them as they were of us, but we stared less (I hope!). They asked to sit and pose for photographs with a few of us, and in hesitant English one of the guys suggested that we should definitely visit Hyderabad because it was beautiful and hot – 'no cold cold like this'.

The train ride was unexpectedly a highlight of the day. This line is part of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway, and the little train huffed and puffed and took us on a steep ride through
street markets
forests and winding tunnels cut into the beautiful mountain side.

After the morning’s excitement, the afternoon was pretty laid back. We were dropped off outside the Botanical Gardens where we had drinks at a cafe before we wandered around the grounds. I don’t wish to be mean, but it was a bit of a stretch to call it a Botanical Garden (especially when I’d paid for a camera ticket and wasn’t inspired to take many photos at all). It would be very fair to call it a beautiful garden/park, and there were many local families who had settled down on the lawns with picnics which gave it a very friendly atmosphere. We then explored the slightly smelly market stalls in the surrounding streets... where there were garlands of green and yellow bananas, piles of carrots, radishes and green mangoes, and corn and raw peanuts ready for roasting on the open grills.

We then walked back towards our hotel with a scheduled stop at Hotel Alagapuri's Family bar to have a few drinks for Damien's birthday. As usual a few drinks turned into quite a few drinks, and we had to hurry back to get ready for dinner.
street markets

Later that evening we boarded auto rickshaws (motorised tricycles with a passenger cabin) for the short but cold drive to Fortune Resort Hotel. It was set in a lovely old building with high ceilings, chandeliers and grand staircases. The consensus around the table was that dinner wasn't as fabulous as had been expected, but our vegetarian dishes of tandoori aloo (potatoes stuffed with cashews, green chillies and coriander and baked in a tandoor oven) and kadai ke karishme (Indian cottage cheese, mushrooms and mixed vegetables in spicy tomato onion gravy) were quite delicious.

Before dinner Karni, Andrew, Brian and I had trawled a few cake shops until Karni found a suitably showy white chocolate cake for Damien's birthday. The cake came out of the restaurant kitchen with dimmed lights and candles ablaze. We were so happy to have been able to be part of Damien's 50th birthday in India, and dinner at the hotel was a lovely way to finish our two day stay in Ooty.

We had intended to go back to the Family Bar for drinks but it was closed, so we all ended up in Damien's room to see off the last of the Jameson
damien's 50th birthday cake
Whiskey. We hope we didn't keep the whole hotel floor up with our music and laughter.

Next we travel north into the jungle of the Mudumalai National Park in Tamil Nadu.

Day 6
Today we leave Munnar. It is a 6am alarm, for a 6.30 leave. We decided to go to the reception a bit early to allow time for last minute Facebook and messages whilst we still have wifi. Tom and I aimed to get some breakfast before leaving, this task didn't prove to be easy! The restaurant didn't open for ten minutes, the guy really struggled with us wanting to pack up bread and go! Although we got there in the end!
We have the pleasure of a 200k drive which will take about 9 hours. In UK, that seems a bit strange, but the
reason it takes that long is because of the very narrow, winding mountainous roads. We are heading for Mudumalai where we have a jeep safari booked at 4.30pm. On the way, we drove through Anamalai Tiger Reserve, we only saw monkeys, Jallipatty, Mettupalayam, Aravenu, Kotagiri, Perar, Pykara, Naduvattum, Gudalur, Thorapally,, Masinagudi to name just a few that I noticed in English! It was a hard journey, looking at the landscape can only maintain your interest for a while, certainly not nine hours. Therefore, I slept out of boredom, but you ti, can only do that for so long, you end up feeling queasy. I was pleased when it was over! It actually took over ten hours by the the we arrived at the hotel.
We are the very first Westeners to ever stay at this hotel. They were worried about taking us in!
We had a bit of a rest then went on a night safari through Mudumalai Tiger reserve. Sadly we didn't see see anything, but it was a good experience.

After the what was probably the worst journey of my life on public buses, down tiny winding roads, going over the completely unnecessary amount of speed bumps they seem to have in Tamil Nadu and travelling for around three hours to complete a 60Km journey! Me and Raja arrive in Madurai around 11pm, it's finally got to the dreaded time when I had to say goodbye to Raja and board a bus heading for Chennai, and thus beginning what was probably the worst 12 hours or so of my trip!



The bus to Chennai is semi-sleeper, so I'm basically lying in a chair that reclines quite far, feeling like I’m in the person behinds lap! Going over yet more fucking speed bumps that wake me up and throw me off the chair before crashing back down!

I arrive In Chennai ready to meet Anoop, go to his and have a shower and a rest! Turns out Anoop isn't at the bus park....FUCK! I find a pay phone and attempt to contact him, this proves futile as the line is busy. After trying to call him for 20 minutes and not getting through, I begin to get quite angry and smash the phone back onto it's holder! A man then offers me his phone to use, I manage to get through to Anoop and he's unable to meet me 'till the evening. Great, I've got a full day in Chennai, I don't know where I am, I've got my rucksack to carry all day, no money other than 400Rs in the bank, which if I draw out will take me overdrawn due to the bank charge for drawing out abroad! Fuck sake!



I take the risk, draw out the money and head to a bus station. It quickly becomes apparent that either no one in Chennai can speak English or i'm in the wrong end of town! Turns out to be both, I get on a bus that i've been told is going to George town (tourist area). It took me around half an hour to explain what George town was, It's started to really get on my nerves that Indians can't just work out what you're tyring to say when you mispronounce something! I suppose English isn't their first language and i'm in their country, so no complaining.

I stay on the bus till it terminates as the conductor also doesn't have a fucking clue where i'm talking about!

I'm now on the opposite wrong end of town! Brilliant. Fuck this i'm just going to get a tuk-tuk, job done.

First stop is to get some dinner, all this thinking on an empty stomach isn't good. I call Anoop and arrange to meet him around 6pm, six hours to kill and not much money!

I leave my rucksack at the train station, and head inside to catch the train to the beach, easily the best way to pass time for free.

I'm waiting on the platform minding my own business, and these two guys walk over and they're steaming! One holds his hand out for me to shake, I do, he asks where i'm from etc, but he's really squeezing my hand, and not like a firm handshake, quite painfully. I yank my hand back and he still doesn't let go, so I lightly push him back and he stumbles halfway across the plaform....Now there's trouble, him and his mate are now eyeing me up like they want a fight. They walk over and I exhaust what little Tamil I know to get them to leave, I was being polite, all the while waiting for one of them to swing a punch (They would've got done, they were small and steaming). Eventually the train pulls in, I go to board, so do they, it seems they've been watching to see what train I get on. Then I hear someone call me from behind, it's someone who works at the station and he's seen the whole ordeal unfold. He speaks really good English so I explain the problem to him, he calls the guys in and gives them a stern telling off. He then calls the police from the station, and i'm now wondering who they're going to side with. Of course me, there's two drunk guys (drinking is a kind of taboo in Tamil Nadu) making a fool of themselves and probably from an Indian's point of view, their country. They're hassling a tourist at a time when India is really pushing to make tourism a bigger industry. Anyway, that's the last I see of these guys, they probably got beaten with some bamboo or something, who knows. Dickheads.





I spend the rest of the day rather uneventfully, and then meet Anoop in the evening. Go to this house, and find out that his mum is also a brilliant chef, and can easily rival Raja's mum!



The whole week was just spent chilling out really, Anoop lives like an hour outside of Chennai, so I couldn't be bothered going over to Puducherry or Mamallapuram, and i'm definitely coming back at some point so i'll see those places then.

We drank a few times, played football, and I went to watch Anoop's friend play football one day.

Not too much worth mentioning in the blog.



This, unfortunately, is my last blog entry on this trip! I've had an absolutely amazing three months! Met some brilliant people who'll i'll be friends with for life. I'm really not looking forward to going home (I can confirm how shit it is as i'm writing from home)! Now it's time to start saving and planning for the next trip!



Si Thi Marra!

Chennai, India
The hotel where we stayed in Chennai
Instead of going to the usual tourist spots in India, we decided to visit the south of India in Kerala and Tamil Nadu states. I am glad we did because I got to see another part of India that foreigners don't normally travel to.

We flew into Chennai from Trivandrum on Kingfisher Airlines. The approximately one hour domestic flight was quite smooth and the cabin crew were dressed in attractive uniforms, and provided the passengers with good service. We were even given a snack box and a soft drink. I should mention that Chennai used to be known as Madras in the past, and was an important trading port during British colonial rule. Today, it is the 4th most populous city in India, and the capital of Tamil Nadu state.

Upon arrival at Chennai airport we found that it was undergoing major renovations, so there were a lot of construction work going on, and building materials lying around. We waited for the taxi pick up from the hotel in town that we had already booked earlier. We waited in vain as it never came. This was our second time in India that we had experienced this let down. Even

after we phoned the hotel it was of no avail, so we just found an old taxi that looked like an exact replica of the taxi cabs in London.

I had changed some of my US dollars into Indian currency at the airport, but found out that it was not enough to cover the cab fare. I told the driver that I wanted to stop at a bank to change more money, explaining to him why. However, he agreed to take a combination of dollars and rupees to make up the total fare.

Our hotel, the Malles Manotaa was listed as a serviced apartment, but it looked just like a standard hotel to us. There were plenty of stores and commercial establishments around the hotel, and after checking in we immediately went to a bakery nearby to check out what was available. Well, there were a lot of delicious looking pastries and we bought a number of them. Their tastes didn't disappoint at all. We had an early dinner at the hotel and turned in early that first night as we had planned to take the bus to Pondicherry the next day. (Separate blog on trip to Pondicherry
Chennai, India

posted on here already)

After our trip to Pondicherry we retired again early as both of us were exhausted from the long bus ride. The next morning after breakfast we enquired at the front desk downstairs about taking the bus to MGM Dizzee World, an amusement park on the outskirts of Chennai. It looked like we had to take another bus from the same bus terminal where we took the bus to Pondicherry. As luck would have it, this bus also ran the same route to Pondicherry on East Coast Road, so we had the chance to enjoy some of the scenic views on the trip the previous day. However, the ride was much shorter, I think only about 45 minutes maximum.

Dizzee World looked just like other theme/amusement parks I've been to, but on that particular day it wasn't so crowded. I suppose because it was a weekday. However, they were several groups of school girls in their uniforms along with their teachers, who incidentally were nuns. The girls loved it when we took photos of them! I don't think I tried any of the games or rides as they are made especially for children. I must

say though that the park was well maintained and looked quite clean. After a relaxing afternoon at this park we took the bus back to Chennai, then another three wheel auto rickshaw to our hotel, and had an early dinner again.

I have always liked Indian food since I was a young boy. Growing up in Rangoon, Burma there was no short supply of Indian restaurants in the city and suburbs. In fact, Burmese food is heavily influenced by Indian cuisine. I mention about Indian food because at the Malles Manotaa hotel, breakfast was included with the room. The very first morning when we went to the rooftop restaurant for breakfast, I noticed a row of trays on the long table filled with assorted Indian dishes. They looked very tempting so I started to help myself thinking it was part of the breakfast menu. There was this young man who was obviously one of the hotel staff behind the table. He had asked me earlier what I wanted for breakfast and I said that I would just help myself. I was wondering why he started to look a bit uncomfortable, when he told me that the trays were part

of a special order by a group of company employees who were staying at the hotel! Oh my, I had made what the French call ""faux pas."" Anyway, with a sheepish grin, I hurriedly put my plate away and just settled for a good old Western breakfast of omelette and toast! I have been known to 'put my foot in my mouth' on several other occasions too! Luckily, there were only a couple of other hotel guests around at that time, and on the other occasions, I have always managed to put on a straight face.

On the third and last day of our stay in Chennai, we decided to do a tour of the city since our flight to Colombo was leaving only in the evening. The doorman at our hotel introduced us to his friend who owned another of those 3 wheel cabs. We told him we wanted to hire him to take us around the city, and after we agreed on the price we set off first to the Thousand Lights mosque which is a multi domed mosque and a revered place of worship for Muslims. Although India is a predominantly Hindu country there is also

a sizable Muslim population.

Next stop was the Kapaleeshwar Temple which is one of the main tourist attractions in Chennai, and another place of worship, but this time for Hindus. The door to enter the temple was locked but a man there offered to show us the inside of the temple for 500 rupees which we agreed to, although I thought it was a bit of a rip off. The tour inside didn't take long as it was not a very big complex.

On the way to our next attraction I stopped at a vegetarian restaurant for lunch. It was a very busy place but the service was quick. I was served a variety of vegetable dishes with rice on a banana leaf. It was all you can eat and one can ask for second or third helpings too! The price was very cheap also, I think only 30 or 35 rupees.

The highlight of our short tour was the St. Thomas Basilica a 16th century Portuguese church which was rebuilt by the British in Neo-Gothic style in the late 19th century. Imagine a big Roman Catholic cathedral in Hindu India! It is rumored that Thomas, one

of the apostles of Jesus was assassinated nearby and today, you can see the tomb of St. Thomas in the cellar of the cathedral. Although we are not Catholics we were both impressed with this magnificent church and spent more time there than at the other sites we visited. Oh, I should add that there is a quaint little bakery on the same street just as you leave the church grounds. For a small shop it had a wide selection of confectionaries and snacks available at reasonable prices.

We took a short break to walk along the wide streets near the beach. I remember seeing many nice looking hotels and houses in this area, and I thought to myself that this must be one of the prime locations in the city. I also wondered what it must have been like in the days of the British Raj, with their exclusive Gymkhana clubs where 'dogs and natives not allowed inside' signs were posted at the entrance.

The last stop on our sight seeing tour was Marina beach along the Bay of Bengal (and part of the Indian Ocean) which is said to be the second longest beach in the

world. As far as the eyes could see, it certainly looked very long to me. I had read some negative reviews about this beach, mainly saying that the beach was always crowded and dirty. Well to me, it was not crowded at all, maybe because it was a weekday. As far as it being dirty, I have been to much dirtier beaches around the world. Anyhow, if you are in the mood to go for very long walks in the sand, then this is the place to go to.

It was getting late and we had a plane to catch, so from Marina beach we went back to our hotel. We were very satisfied with this mini city tour, and our driver too. He was very good and waited for us patiently at every stop we made. Goodbye Chennai, goodbye India, perhaps we'll see you again.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Tirunelveli
November 29th 2014
Published: November 29th 2014


The train from Thrissur to Chennai, via Tirunelveli is one of the busiest in India as there aren't many that go in a day. To get a bed in sleeper you need to book a month in advance, so i'm back to facing the reality of sitting in general class for 12 hours! Fuck sake, not again!

I get on the train in sleeper as usual hoping I can upgrade when the Titi (conductor) comes, there's nothing available in sleeper, not even with a bribe! So I end up in A/C 2, which essentially 1st class, 700rs later and i'm in a compartment closed off with a curtain with an Indian family who're all staring at me....brilliant. Being in 1st class you'd expect top quality comfort etc, you do get a bed sheet and blanket, but the blanket is made from that fucking horrible itchy material! And the A/C is actually way too cold, and as such I end up catching the flu! Nothing a magic pill from Raja's uncle can't sort out though.



When I arrive in Tirunelveli it's raining, or drenching as Raja refers to it! The platform is really slippy, and with the combination of my flip-flops, haste and heavy bag I manage to spectacularly fall over, one bag goes flying, I do a few rolls...There wasn't any wet floor signs, this is India, you're meant to have common sense! I think back home I'd definitely be in for a huge compo claim!



The roads have all flooded, so the bike ride to Raja's was quite fun, his familiar expression of “what the fuck”, which i'm sure he didn't pick up from last year.....



When I arrive at his house i'm greeted by his family, his brother (who he didn't mention once last year, apparently I didn't ask!) mother and father! His parents speak no English, and his brother can't understand my Northern accent haha. His parents do a whole lot of smiling though, and I exhaust all my Tamil within 5 minutes of arriving. His Mum is literally the best cook I've ever come across in my life, save from maybe my Grandma, everything she cooked was top notch!



The first day I just met Raja's friends, and went to the temple in Tirunelveli. The best thing about Tirunelveli, no white people in sight, back to being a totally cool fucking hipster traveller. We went to the cinema to watch one of the latest movies, Forest. It was fucking dreadful and i'm glad I couldn't understand what was happening properly, it was confirmed to be shite by Raja and his friends. Basically the whole movie was about some guys stealing wood or something...



We went down to Kanyakumari, the tip of the ice berg, so to speak. It's the very bottom point of India, where the Arabian sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal all meet, it's really fucking strange to see the tide coming in from three different angles. There's two massive rocks 500M out to see from the coast, ones got a memorial for a Hindu reformer Vivekanada, who swam out to the rocks (fuck knows how! The current was so strong!) in 1892 to meditate on the teachings of his guru who'd recently died. On the other rock's got a 40M statue of an acient Tamil saint Thiruvalluar. There was a tsunami there in 2010, and the wave reached the top of the statue's head, the rock the statue is on is probably 20M high, I can't even imagine the fear of seeing a fucking wave that big! 60 fucking Metres plus high!



Monday, Raja took me to a local temple in Tiruchendur. This is a Murugan temple, Hindu men have to be abstinent for a period of time before they go, bathe every morning at a certain time, and walk to the temple bear foot and bear chested. They wear only a Lungi and chains around their neck (necklace), this is as a sign of respect to the god. Thankfully they only do this once a year, and Raja goes in January, so we can get the train there.



On Tuesday, it's a road trip on the bikes with Raja's friends to some water falls around 60km away, a local Indian tourist attraction, and again no white people! Get in! The place is full of hordes of Indians all clamouring the get under the falls. So of course we go under, the water hits you so hard! But the best shower I've had for weeks and I was probably due a wash anyway!

When we get back from the temple, we meet up with Raja's friends and go to watch the new hit movie, Knife, with the biggest hero in Tamil movies. In Tamil Nadu the heros in movies will be in loads of movies, and they'll be the sole star, unlike in Hollywood. The guys love these guys, they're their heros, and they're looked up to much like a kid would look upto Ronaldo or Messi etc. Despite not being able to understand the language, Raja helps me out with the plot, and the movie isn't that bad, unlike fucking forest the other day.



On Wednesday, me and Raja got the train to Kodaikanal, a hill station close to the boarder with Kerela, you can trek from here to Munnar in Kerela, so next trip that's the plan! Really beautiful place, probably on par with Ooty, which I visited last year. Not much to really say other than that, although it was really expensive, 600rs a night! And there transport to and from is few and far between, we had to get a public bus which took 5 hours, from Madurai, which is only 50km away!





Thursday we go back to Madurai and it's time to leave Raja and head off for the final leg of the journey, Chennai and meeting up with Anoop! Better make the most of my final week before reality! Fuck sake.

November 25th 2014

IMG_5764
Traveling is one such domain which I prefer not to miss. My family generally plans an annual outing and I am always into it. This time it's South India.Puducherry or Pondicherry meaning “new settlement”. “Puducherry” is the French interpretation of the original name “Puducheri”


From Chennai early morning we started in a rented vehicle, Tata Indica. Chennai is situated 160 km north of Pondicherry i.e.non- stop three hour road journey. The East Coast Road, commonly called ECR road from Chennai to Pondicherry is a scenic highway. The seashore en route is irresistible resulting in a number of stops. The drive parallel to the coast of Bay of Bengal is a wonderful experience although we cannot see the sea until the last few miles. This route passes through Mahabalipuram, Kalpakkam, Pudupattinam, Idaikkazhinadu, Mudaliarkuppam Marakkanam etc.

Our driver told a lot about his native land. He is a tamilian.Our first stop was the famous golden beach park. We took some clicks in front of the artistically fabricated gate. There were rows of elephant and guard statues depicting icon of protection .We had visited it during our Chennai trip so we didn’t waste our time and set off. Next was the famous crocodile park. The park is full of crocodiles,gharials and aligators.Its a centre of herpetology-eggs of different species and an aquarium of hatchlings are kept for display.Hordings displayed the variety of species found all over the world, their life cycle, their process of reproduction and unique characteristics. There was a stall where every bought out item was imitations of crocodiles. There were crocodiles in water, at bank, on branches-all dead lying in the scorching heat. It seems they are overpopulated. The whole park consists of plants and herbs of different kinds. There were aerial roots, stilt roots etc similar to those of mangroves. Besides these some tortoise and turtles were also kept. It was around 8.30am and we didn’t have breakfast. We stopped in a hotel “A2B-Adyar Ananda Bhavan” .All south Indian dishes. We had dosa.It was hot and delicious.

Around 10.30 am we reached Mamallapuram or Mahabalipuram.There we saw the famous Krishna's Butterball. It is a giant natural rock on the brink of a hillside, seemingly mysterious as the area nearby is very slippery. The hillside makes a great natural slide and it was simply impossible with slippers on. I crawled with bare feet but the burning and slippery rocks threatened my steps every moment. We somehow balanced and took snaps sitting underneath it, posing like holding it etc.There are many huge rocks in that place, some of them has been crafted beautifully. The area was flocked with tourist both Indian and foreigners.

There were some famous places like Pandavas rathas, Arjuna’s penance, Shore temple etc.The area brimmed with rock-cut caves and numerous temples. Some of the temples were even carved out of one giant rock. We were in dearth of time so could not visit this place exquisitely. We just listen to the stories and history of this place from our driver who was our guide all the way. Actually you need another day devoted to this place. We just stopped for a while and took a family snap in front of the sculptures on the way. In a nutshell, Mamallapuram is a good stopover.

Then we set off for Puducherry. This journey is very popular among the riders. On one side the never ending sea “Bay of Bengal” and on the other side the beautiful coconut trees standing in rows. The panoramic view makes the journey worthwhile. Along the way we crossed people most in half lungi riding a bike-typical south Indian look. We pass by Mudaliarkuppam, a place which has a cool boat house. Then we crossed Marakkanam .There were fields where salt is separated, strained and purified for utility. All along the way we saw villagers seating under the trees and selling coconut water. Lots of tourist comes here every year and this business is a profitable one. We too enjoyed the cool coconut water.

We crossed the magnificent welcome gate; engraved in it was the word “Pondicherry”. Pondicherry has a feeling, an essence of peace. It’s a small town with a tinge of Mediterranean flavour. The wide boulevard, yellow coloured mansions, elegant churches and green parks preserving the French heritage make this town a unique one in India.

Around 1 PM we reached the famous ”Aurobindo Ashram”.Puducherry is famous for this tranquil ashram where devotees from India and all over the world flocks to it for spiritual salvation.

The Aurobindo Ashram is located on rue de la Marine, one of the most well known ashrams in India. It is open to the public daily between 8AM to 12Noon and 2PM to 6PM.So instead of waiting; we decided to visit the temple, Manakula Vinayagar Koil.

It’s a Ganesha temple more than 300 years old .It has a golden spire and walls portraying different forms of Ganesha. The temple also has a smaller shrine dedicated to Lord Murugan, who is Ganesha’s younger brother. Thousands of devotees visit it every day. The temple also has an elephant; Lakshmi who attracts lots of devotees specially children. In our country the blessings of elephant is considered sacred. Lakshmi uses her trunk to shower blessings and to eat eateries from the devotees. People gather around her to get their share of blessings. My small brother and I too went near her, patted her and gave fruits to eat. She stretched her trunk, ate those and put her trunk on our heads showering blessings. We took lots of pictures with her, while our mother was busy offering her prayers to God for our good. It was a long queue. We entered the main mandir, prasad and anjali was offered to us. We saw the portraits of Ganesha in different forms.

By now we were terribly hungry. Our driver took us to the restaurant “Adayar Ananda Bhavan” at J.N.Street.It was a branch of the same network of restaurants. These restaurants are very popular in south India. We had south Indian thali with dahi.Its omi-coconut oil, a treat to our appetite. My mother and I went to the market just to have a glimpse of all the goods to soothe our shopaholic temperament.

We proceeded to the Ashram. The Ashram was set up in 1926 by Sri Aurobindo Ghose, one of India’s greatest philosopher-poets. There was a photo gallery displaying the photos of Aurobindo and his disciples and writings depicting his preaching. His philosophy deeply rooted in yoga and his writings inspired a number of followers. One of them was a Persian called Mirra Alfassa, who was so inspired by his philosophy that she stayed on in puducherry and was instrumental in establishment of the ashram. After Aurobindo’s death in 1950, the running of the Ashram was entrusted to his chief disciple, Mirra Alfassa, also known as ‘The Mother’. The placidity of the ashram makes one feel the happiness of salvation. There lies the grave of the founder bedecked with flowers and incense stick.



Visit to puducherry is incomplete without a walk along beach road .Most of the beaches is a little away from the town except for small stretch of sand on Goubert Avenue. The 1.5 km long walkway running along the beach is the delight of puducherry.

There are various monuments along the avenue like the statue of Mahatma Gandhi, the War memorial, the statue of Joan of Arc, the heritage town hall, old light house, the old customs house.

The Mairie, located on Goubert Avenue is a charming mustard-white building, facing the sea. It has an appealing French ambience. Today it houses the offices of the Puducherry Municipality. A four-meter statue of Mahatma Gandhi is surrounded by eight magnificent granite pillars.The French War Memorial on Goubert Avenue is solemn reminder of those brave soldiers who laid down their lives during the First World War. We captured each monument with the moment in our camera to be cherished later.

Lastly we sat at the rocky beach with fruit salad in our hand relaxing; the cool splatter of sea water hitting our face every time the huge waves collides the rocks. The bright blue sky giving its way to a hazy tint of orange, before our eyes, marvels us as the sun sets in the horizon.

Mamallapuram Beach and Temple, and sleeping person
First two weeks: After a rapid exit from Chennai airport at 1am via taxi, along a cow-strewn East Coast road we arrived in the beach resort of Mamallapuram where we gathered ourselves, our bikes, started adjusting to curry and met a future beatboxing and Bollywood star of India called Kathki who had enough belief in himself for all India. We saw a really old temple.

After 5 days, with our bikes assembled and our nerves sufficiently set, we set off South towards Puducherry with an overnight stop at an idyllic house boat. We had aimed to leave early morning but things being the way they are, we left at 12pm. Sadly the house boat turned out to be a boat house without anywhere to eat nor sleep so we ventured on a further 50km at speed, in an attempt to avoid cycling in the dark, which we had vowed not to do ever (or at least very rarely), with a packet of biscuits and 3 small bananas.

We cycled fast, yet it was not enough and low and behold we were cycling as the light dimmed to reach our first couchsurfer host, one day earlier than planned without knowing
we love sun bathing with cows...
his address. Fortunately white folk are thin on the ground North of Puducherry and some locals knew the brother’s number and we eventually got to his house at 10pm.

We stayed in ‘Eternity’, an extension of the hippy village known as Auroville, where international communities coexist to create a better world. We swam in a marble-lined fresh water swimming pool every morning and listened to a frog chorus every night. This was great for 3 days until a cyclone hit and then we had to listen to it for a further 3 nights. Eventually it passed and we moved on to Chidambaram where we stayed in a grotty hole and saw a lovely temple with a fire ceremony.

Mayiladuthurai was our next stop, where gods were washed in the river at a special festival. Jude blessed himself in the river and Yvi got blessed by an elephant. Our Indian mobile which had taken 3 days to organise (due to security concerns around terrorism) also got blessed in the river. Not such a smart phone any more but holy nonetheless. We saw a small temple and got interviewed on state TV which was hilarious and awkward as local boys
THE BUTTERBALL
got pushed out of shot (by Yvi) to keep us in frame. For dinner we ate Navaratma Khurma which was laced with cashew nuts – Jude survived, despite his Homerton Hospital blood test scientifically proving he has a nut allergy.

Our feeling like local stars was heightened on our journey to Thanjavore, where we currently reside, when we found ourselves with a small following of 2 mopeds and an auto rickshaw, asking if we wanted photos with them (this is on top of the usual 100 hi-byes we do every day). En route, we treated ourselves to a lunchtime super strong beer in the seedy underworld of legitimate drinking in Tamil Nadu and repeated this later this some Londoners we met at our hotel in an even dingier bar.

Tomorrow we put our sore, sorry arses on a train to Madurai, apparently there’s a really nice temple there.

PS our bells and horn are invaluable in Indian traffic and the Kindle and selfie stick are getting plenty of abuse.

The Pondi and Auroville Route..
A very general idea of the places visited. Wish the map was a bit more detailed...


To the main road...
Made for a lovely walk....
When life unwantedly summoned me to Chennai last October, I was left with 3 spare days as I did not find a return ticket to Kolkata sooner. The purpose of my visit over after the 2nd day, I had THREE FULL DAYS in a part of the country where very few know me, the local language I did not speak or understand, it could not have been better!!! It had been sometime that I had had time for myself and when the opportunity presented itself I grabbed it gleefully. After finishing off a planned visit to my friend Shankar on the 2nd evening, I left for Pondicherry by bus the next morning.

I primarily had two options. First, I could spend the rest of the days in Chennai, going around the city and experiencing all that I had read about in the commemorative edition of “The Frontline”. Chennai has completed 375 years and has a very interesting history and I wanted to see for myself all the places mentioned in the magazine. The other option was Pondicherry. With it's French history, association with Rishi Aurobindo and not the least Auroville (I had heard much about it from a relative!!), Pondicherry

attracted me as much as Chennai. While I already had a booking at a guest house in Auroville and Shankar had successfully insisted on booking a bus ticket to Pondicherry before my actual journey, I was ambivalent about how it would turn out and wanted to keep my plans flexible. I chose Pondicherry because I did not know when I would get three consecutive days again and I knew Pondicherry requires at least 2 days. Chennai on the other hand can be experienced in instalments and I would always be visiting Chennai for my present work here. In retrospect I feel I made the right decision.

Day 1:

The East Coast Road, connecting Chennai to Cuddalore, is 690 kms long. My journey however would end much earlier at Pondicherry which is at approximately 130 kms from Chennai. The road, also called ECR, was originally conceived to connect the city of Chennai with the fishing villages which dot the Bay of Bengal coast and also some important places like Karaikal, Chidambaram, Pondicherry, Mahabalippuram. It now serves as the lifeline for the villages in the region and with increasing traffic is being converted into a 4 lane highway by the
Auroville Basic Layout..
Tamil Nadu government. The route till Pondicherry is scenic. With the azure sea on your left, separated from the road by trees and shrubs, it seemed like a dream drive. The sight of villagers with their towels wrapped around their heads in an effort to save themselves from the hot coastal sun reminded me that the bus is air-conditioned and what looks beautiful to me from my comfortable seat has a very different reality. Interspersed with the sights of the sea are villages, small towns and luxury beach resorts (I guess it is too tempting to leave such a locale unexploited for commercial ventures. I initially mistook the resorts for private properties and wished if I could own one). All along the route the presence of the large lakes, canals, rivers along with the sea on the left makes it really beautiful. One can see far on either side and with our lives becoming more and more confined to small places in our offices and apartments, the wide open spaces makes you feel light and free. The Palar River, which empties into the sea, is almost dry. I had been tracking the route on the GPRS facility on my mobile

and these lakes seemed really big in the maps displayed. The other side of the lakes (namely Kaliveli and Odiyur) were not visible from the bus. I wondered if they are natural or man made and google failed to give me an answer. Savouring the sights and sometimes sleeping, I approached Pondicherry. The bus dropped me off at a place about 6 kms from Pondicherry, at the junction of a small road. The hand painted stone signboard said that the small insignificant road would take me to the international city called Auroville. I was slightly disappointed and had doubts about being in the right place. The auto rickshaw driver's confident manners (his mannerisms were the only signs as I hardly understood what he said), were assuring. The presence of non-Indians, who seemed to be at home, cycling or riding a two wheeler to their destinations, further removed my doubts. The road into Auroville, keeps twisting and turning and is not completely tarred. Built on red laterite soil and winding it's way through verdant surroundings, it is hard to imagine for first timers like me that it can lead to such an international project. After 20 mins and some confusion, I

reached the Center Guest House where I had a booking.



Auroville…

Auroville is an experiment. It is a township setup by Mirra Alfassa in the Villupuram district of Tamil Nadu. Also revered as “The Mother” by her followers, Mirra was the principle spiritual collaborator of Rishi Aurobindo (1872-1950). Parisan by birth, The Mother came to know about Sri Aurobindo through her husband Paul Antoine Richard in 1914 and about 6 years later in 1920, post a visit to France and Japan she came back to Pondicherry for permanent residence. In 1968 Auroville was setup to actualize the teachings of Sri Aurobindo and was designed by Roger Anger. Today it is home to approx. 2500 Aurovillans who have come from all across the globe. The Mother believed that the city would be a place where people from all over the world can come together to live in peace and unity. She believed in the concept of man being a transitional being. In Mother’s words:

""Auroville is meant to be a universal town where men and women of all countries are able to live in peace and progressive harmony, above all creeds, all politics and all nationalities.
Lakshmi: The Ganesh Temple Elephant
Lakshmi being fed. The partly visible mahaut makes enormous balls of rice mixed with what seemed like milk and puts it in Lakshmi’s mouth. Lakshmi on her part swallows down everything obediently.
The purpose of Auroville is to realize human unity.""

In the center of the city lies the Holy Banyan along the Matrimandir. The city spirals outwards from here over an area of about 1200 acres. The center known as Peace Area also has an open air-auditorium and a lake.

I would restrain myself here as it felt like I am doing a documentary on Auroville. This is meant to be personal narrative and in keeping with that aim let’s get back to the guest house. One can visit the website of Auroville for more details.

Similar to the surroundings, the Guest House was covered in green, with the guest rooms spread across the compound, fenced by a hardly visible barbed wire. In the center were the office and the dining hall. Sarvanan, the manager of the guest house was mild mannered, smiling and the expression of his eyes did not match his words. He remarked that since my mobile will not work in Auroville, I might need to use the landline in my room and informed me the call charges. My room with 2 beds, a wooden table and a set of 2 chairs with a coffee

table was neatly done. The quiet all around me, broken only by a bird’s call or noise from an occasional human activity, was further complemented by the room. I almost immediately liked it.

Post lunch, I sat down with the information pamphlet and the Auroville map provided to me to create an itinerary for my stay. By this time I had already planned that I would witness events, lectures and like at Auroville and intended to go leave this place with more information about Rishi Aurobindo and The Mother. I cannot claim to know anything more than a basic outline of their lives now but back then I was completely ignorant. My ignorance was intentional. One of the chief impediments to our learning process is our knowledge. It becomes very difficult to unlearn and gather new things. So I wanted to keep it simple and without any prejudice wanted to experience the place (or for that manner any other place). I planned to visit the Matrimandir the next morning and there were a few events during the latter part of the day. But before all that, I had to go to the Visitor’s Centre and get the passes for the next day’s visit to the Matrimandir. I already had met Dr. Mitra at lunch and we planned to get the passes together.

Dr. Mitra, an endocrinologist from Nagpur, was on a holiday and had planned a long stay at Auroville. We immediately struck off and soon were exchanging our opinion on various things on our way to the central office to get our passes. A Marathi by birth, and married to a Bengali (perhaps one of the reasons for her interest in another Bengali), she came across as a friendly person.

At dinner I was introduced to Laurent. He was a resident of New Caledonia, a small island off the coast of Australia. His country is a French dominion and currently in turmoil. The indigenous Kanaks want independence from France and want their own government. This worried Laurent as he was French by birth and combined with his deep seated desire to travel and see the world made him restless. One of his aims was checking the feasibility of becoming an Aurovilian. Along with Pallavi, another visitor and a teacher by profession, we had a long discussion on variety of things, mostly impersonal, but enjoyable.



Day 2:

Early morning next day, after a walk with Dr. Mitra, I visited the Matrimandir. The immensity of the structure and the sprawling gardens and peace of the place made a deeper impact on me than the Inner Chamber. The Inner Chamber has a crystal ball, on which one is to concentrate. With the sunlight, carefully controlled through a system of mirrors in the aperture at the top of the dome, directed on the crystal and then passing through the crystal to the lotus pond below, makes it look beautiful. Add the air-conditioning and the comfortable cushions that you are given to sit, I was more intent on not falling asleep after the hot sun outside. The soporific nature of the place is only enhanced by the dimly lit silence. It is as if you are in a dream, where faces float in and out of sight, disappearing into the white haze beyond. 15 mins of this dream and a flashing light reminds the group that it is time to move out and go down to the lotus pond below the chamber. We are guided to the lotus pond by the genial old lady, (who seemed English) through one of the petals (red structures surrounding the golden sphere of the mandir) which was named Freedom. The petal contained a meditation room (air-conditioned with the same dreamy ambience as the inner chamber). The lotus pond below is a stylized marble structure with a crystal in the center of the marble lotus petals. The light form the Inner Chamber is directed to this crystal below. It was partly cloudy and the light from the chamber was hardly perceptible. I guess so it is with faith on the whole…you have to believe. We were escorted out of the Matrimandir campus, following a visit to the sacred Banyan Tree.

The rest of the day was spent at the visitor’s center, window shopping at the expensive boutiques and sipping coffee with biscuits at the coffee shop. The architecture of the center is impressive with it’s arches and low structures. A lot of open spaces makes it really pleasant. I learnt later, from a group of civil engineers, that the architecture in Auroville is so designed because it requires lower energy consumption and therefore contributes lesser towards global warming. These civil engineers were a part of a group who were being trained on similar technologies at Auroville Earth (an institution which specializes in architecture).

Once the sun goes down, there is not much that you can do as a visitor in Auroville. The streets are not lighted and with just a bicycle with me it was highly possible that I might get lost. Also since mostly all activities are paid (and being on a shoestring budget) I had nothing much to do other than retire to my room. At dinner, I met Dr. Mitra, Laurent and Pallavi once more and had a lively chat. It is interesting to observe how a group automatically seems to develop amongst people who hardly know each other and suddenly it seems there is so much to talk about. Laurent and I had a particularly long chat and it was only when the lights of the dining hall were beginning to switch off that we left.

Day 3:

Around 6AM the next morning, I decided to visit the Matrimandir area once more and was surprised as what had taken about 15 mins in the bus from the visitor’s centre the previous day was just a 10 min walk from my guest house. This time there was no security at the gate and encouraged by a man in a wheelchair and his Labrador, I strolled into the campus. Sitting under the Banyan tree, I was watching a man tend to the garden. He was meticulously spraying pesticides using a long hose, the other end of which was attached to a small spray machine on wheels. There were several like him throughout the campus that morning, each assigned a specific duty. What made it interesting for me was that all of them were foreigners. Seemed like they were all Aurovillans. What was this man with the hose doing in a land so far away from where he was born? What does he aim to achieve by tending to the gardens of the campus of the central showpiece of an experimental town in India? He was in obvious discomfort due to the heat. He looked middle aged and though he had taken precautions, the exposed parts of his body, were sun burnt. It was already getting hot, though not yet 8AM, and I decided to wander my way back to the guest house as I also had to leave for Pondicherry later that day.

I met Laurent at the breakfast and on my suggestion he agreed to take a tour of Pondicherry with me. I had no specific plan and had decided that I would stroll around the old French town and nearby areas. The bus from Visitor’s centre takes one to the Aurobindo Ashram in the city and we decided to take the bus. On reaching the Visitor’s center we learnt that the bus would not be in for another 90 mins and we decided to take an auto-rickshaw (Tuktuk for Laurent) to the Auroville beach on the other side of the East Coast road and then head to Pondicherry from there. The beach was a disappointment. I was a little ashamed, being an Indian and having brought a foreigner with me I wanted to leave the dirty beach and dirtier road to it as soon as possible. We took a local bus from there to Pondicherry. I wondered what Laurent must be thinking. Though not in obvious discomfort, I was sure this was all very new to him but unsure whether he was liking it or not. However I was comforted when he remarked that he was amazed how clean the white shirts and the white dhotis of the local people given that they seemed to travel and live in such conditions.

At Pondicherry we visited the Aurobindo Ashram. This was an old French building where Sri Aurobindo lived. The Mother also had residence in the same house and held conferences with the devotees here. Today one can see the Samadhi of Aurobindo and Mother in the courtyard. Also accessible is the place where Sri Aurobindo used to sit to speak to his audience. The private chambers of the house (Aurobindo’s room on the 1st floor and Mother’s on the 2nd floor) are not accessible without application and subsequent permission. I noticed Laurent donate Rs 100 to the donation box. This man was strange, he was trying to understand himself I guessed. He said he did not feel much for Christianity or in Auroville as it did not touch his heart. He had read about Buddhism and felt it touched him more than Christianity. Now at the Ashram, what moved him to donate money? The Ashram is well looked after, and all the devotees there looked well to do, atleast not suffering from material want. So the need of money was not obvious. Or did he just think that it was customary and wanted to confirm? I myself did not feel any obvious need for supplication or donation. I was hardly aware of the history or significance of the objects in the house to feel the obvious reverence shown by the other visitors. Some visitors I noticed (Indians obviously) thought me to be disrespectful. I guess they could see my obvious lack of reverence in my manners as I sat cross-legged on the verandah where Sri Aurobindo gave audience with my back to the sitting place.

After the Ashram, as we strolled along the old French town, Laurent began to feel at home. He was surprised and delighted to see most of the streets named in French and the restaurants and hotels similarly named. You could see that now he was more sure of himself, whereas I was wondering if I was still in India. I could hardly understand the signboards and the displays and often asked Laurent to translate things for me. The reversal of roles between me and Laurent of guide and tourist was rather interesting. He proudly told me, as we crossed the French Consulate, that all he needs to get into that building and all his issues will be taken care of in case of any trouble. I have never been abroad, but would love it if the Indian Consulate in other countries gave the Indians this kind of assurance to the Indians there. The heat was already getting to us and we were now looking for a place to sit down for lunch. We found a place overlooking the sea and had lunch of Chicken Tikka for Laurent and Fish and Chips for myself. On our way to this restaurant we saw a school of dolphins very close to the shore. I had never seen these beautiful creatures before and was excited. Wish I had a camera where I could have captured their jump over water. This also meant that the sea was pretty deep at a very short distance from the shore. The beach next to the restaurant where small boys were trying to surf in a small area, only confirmed my guess about the depth of the sea. We visited the Sacred Heart Church, next to railway station after we found the Notre Dame De Anges (another church near sea closed). While I was eager to see the churches from inside, I felt Laurent’s slight dis-interest in going into the churches. I felt it did not serve his purpose of visit to India and felt that it would do him no good. He agreed so as to not disappoint me. His dis-interest in churches was very evident at Sacred Heart Church. Built in Gothic style and the red and white church looks beautiful from the inside ( The Sacred Heart Church near Egmore in Chennai was quite a disappointment and I was thought that Pondicherry might also be the same). I found Laurent giving everything a cursory look and quickly he was outside the church looking at things on the sides of the church. The different scenes from the life of Christ depicted throughout the church, were done in both in stained glass as well as frescoes on the wall. As in the case with temples, I get a feeling of missing out on much that is meant to convey. The depiction of the Jesus, saints, angels and their interplay all have a certain story in Christianity and I would love to know all that. While I was wondering all this, I saw Laurent coming in and sitting beside me and enquire about our next destination. Understanding his dis-interest in churches, I offered to visit the Ganesha Temple near the old town. He seemed more interested now and we quickly took a “tuktuk”. Laurent by now had learnt that we need to haggle about the fare with the “tuktuk” drivers and he promptly reduced the price from Rs70 to Rs50 to my amusement. The driver meekly agreed and 15 mins later we were at the Manakula Vinayagar Temple.

The temple dedicated to Lord Ganesha, predates the French occupation of Pondicherry. History states that the temple is originally called Manal Kulathu Vinayagar (meaning: God near the pond of sand). For us unfortunately, the temple was closed and would open at 4PM. We had an hour and 40 mins to kill before we would be let inside. I was able to peep into the dimly lit interiors, through the iron gates, and it seemed all gold to me in the darkness. Part of the temple structure was being renovated. Laurent too had a peep and seemed excited at finally being at a place which was of interest to him. We decided to hang around till 4, and then come back again.

The market across the old canal separating the French Pondicherry from the Indian Puducherry, was a typical Indian shopping place. Shops loudly displaying popular brands of clothing and fashion juggle for space with shops selling Indian handicrafts and carved wood items. With nothing much to do, Laurent and me bought a wooden jewellery box and handmade paper diaries respectively. Though I thought that the prices were way too high, I obliged. That was because I was ashamed to tell Laurent that the shopkeeper has intentionally quoted a higher price seeing that he was a foreigner. Though later he told me that he knew in India he would face all this being white. Another incident which made me feel ashamed was when at the temple, a man came and begged from Laurent. The “beggar” was a properly dressed fellow with no signs of poverty. Just the sight of a white man, made a beggar of him and robbed him of his sense of self-respect. As I intervened man took to his heels when he saw that the white is accompanied by an Indian. The “beggar” apparently spoke fluent French, which surprised Laurent and was able to convince Laurent that he needed money. Such shameful incidents only make us loose our respect in front of others. After spending some time in an airconditioned shop, which we initially entered to escape the heat, Laurent ended up deciding to buy a pair of denim trousers and some 20-25 mins (and 2 shops) later he got the denim he liked. Clicking pictures of another Shiva temple (built in deccan style and closed), we came to a sweetmeat shop for refreshments.

There are things which because of culture or way of life come so naturally to us that we don’t have to give a thought. For others however who might not be accustomed, the same things can be quite puzzling. Making Laurent understand why he should drink the syrup of Ras-Malai and not the syrup of Gulab Jamun is one of them!! He liked Ras Malai more than Gulan Jamun and stated that if the Gulab Jamun can be put into the RasMalai syrup, it would taste even better! It was nearing 4 and after a look-in at a book shop near the temple, we reached the temple shortly after 4pm.

The inside of the temple, which had seemed all gold to me earlier, revealed itself in numerous colors. Golden columns lead to the main chamber where the god resided. The outside walls of the main chamber and walls surrounding the chamber depict all the different aspects of Lord Ganesha as per Hindu Mythology. The other walls are also covered with frescos from scenes of mythology. Behind the main chamber in the two corners are small enclosures which house images of Shiva and other dieties. The temple’s antiquity is evident and evokes a sense of awe. Hundreds of years have passed and what we see today must have been enacted innumerable times over the centuries. I see no reason to believe that the priest 4 hundred years ago would dress any differently that the ones I saw, with their white dhotis and vibhuti smeared foreheads. Also the same column would have been formed then, as now, to offer prayers at the God’s chamber. Old places have a way of enfolding everything within its grasp and lending the same mystical air of antiquity. Perhaps only the iron railings, which seemed modern would not have been there. The design of the iron railings were the only giveaway…else they have blended in perfectly with the place. Another interesting feature of the temple is Lakshmi, the elephant at the gate. She blesses devotees in lieu of small tokens. I gave her Rs10 and promptly she deposited it with her master and blessed me raising her truck over my head and touching it softly. Laurent, after a moments hesitation, did the same and almost lost his cap!!

Meanwhile it was almost 5pm and we were tired. The heat had gotten to us and we hired a cab back to Auroville.

My trip was nearing it’s end. I would leave the next day. My last evening there was almost the same as other evenings. On Dr. Mitra’s suggestion, Laurent started thinking about visiting Kerela before heading back home. His return was already planned and he had 2 weeks with him. I suggested a visit to Kolkata before his departure during Durga Puja and seeing some photographs on the net, he was excited. But I also warned him that Kolkata would also be crowded and hot. (He has since decided on Kerela as he said that the heat and crowd would be too much for him!!).





Coming back to Kolkata:

The next morning, after I settled my dues at the Financial Centre, I met Laurent at the guest house. Bidding our farewell to each other, he joked we would next meet in Paris! I started out at around 11AM and reached Pondicherry bus terminus in an hour. The bus would not leave for another hour and I seated myself comfortably and had some buns for lunch. Thinking about the last three days, I felt like an unwilling school boy returning home after the summer vacations. Back in the bus I could not quite comprehend my feelings. It had been just 5 days, but it seemed more. Another 10 hours and I would be in the familiar settings of Kolkata, but that was hardly a consolation. Familiarity gives comfort, not in my case. I kept on wondering and trying to decipher my feelings all the way back.

At the Kolkata airport, I had a first cue. Due to the taxi strike, there was chaos and for people who did not have their own transport it was like dealing with a bunch of pimps. They charged exorbitant rates for they knew at 11:30 PM, people had little options. My bus journey to Howrah station, from the friend’s place I had put up for the night, the next morning started a series of events which has since helped me comprehend my feelings in the bus back from Pondicherry. I knew I would miss the peace and quiet of Pondicherry in general and Auroville in particular. I knew I would miss being alone and not disturbed. I knew I would miss making friends with complete strangers in an environment which somehow lets people open up. But most of all I knew I would miss being able to see the possibilities of life that we don’t witness in our day to day fight for the mundane. For 4 days I was in an environment which did not have television, no internet (barring the little I have on my phone), very few phone calls. The intrusions of these things in our lives have become so common that we take them for granted. The constant harping of companies brandishing their products and enticing us in different ways have become such an integral part of city life that we hardly realize the cacophony in our thoughts. The congestion in the Howrah bound bus, the garrulous radio jockey, the over-zealous news reader trying to sensationalize every event reported, the newspapers trying to do match the news reader on tv, the hawkers selling varied items in the local trains, the office call during non-office hours are all examples of avoidable and non-avoidable intrusions into our privacy that I had to get acclimatized to. I wonder if I was ever comfortable with these as a mere 5 days should not make me this uneasy. I think I understand the idea behind Auroville and all such places which are meant for quiet contemplation better now. Talking about Auroville, on the 1st evening when I was going around the Visitor’s center with Dr. Mitra and having seen the expensive boutiques and the coffee shops etc there, I was reminded of a book called Karma Cola. It talks about spirituality being sold as commodities and it seemed to be that Auroville was also the same. Plush surroundings and designer interiors coupled with a generally laidback and “cool” attitude of the staff is a sure way of attracting the huge number of foreigners who come here. Westerners, whatever their idea of Indian spirituality, probably come here to experience something which seems so important in their lives but cannot experience in their own countries. Indian visitors, I saw, were mostly people whose curiosity for Auroville was like visiting a zoo or a museum. I don’t exclude myself from this group of Indians. Barring the locals, for whom Auroville perhaps have provided a school for their children or better means of livelihood, all others had a very commercial interest in the project. But now, in hindsight, I think it is just the sheen required to attract people. (Had I stayed for 3 days, if room was not comfortable??)

In the peaceful atmosphere, generally non-intrusive life and the non-commercial approach to things (barring the visitor’s centre of course..) one finds a solace and place to quieten thoughts. The verdant surroundings and greater physical activity from walking/cycling adds to feeling of well-being. While talking about quality of life, the generally accepted economic thought today drives people towards more consumption and it is this aspect of city life that is the bane of modern civilization. Auroville is small experiment to defy the trend. However one wonders, if the current setup would have been possible for the facilities being used here to make life easier for residents have been made available in a specifically commercialized world. Probably we would have seen a different setup had the world all around been different, because then the expectations of people would also have been different. Personally speaking though, the trip brought into sharp focus the need to reduce the noise in my head and re-visualize the possibilities with my own self.

Idly
-because its just too good.
Yes, you heard it here first! It's the official 9 year old report and I would have to agree. This week we have continued to enjoy Banyon beach, the thrills of the scooter, playing with the Tamilian children, visiting the Auroville Botanical Garden and planting some seeds in the vegetable garden at Aspiration. In the garden we planted lades finger, a variety of beans and watermelon. However, after the monsoon rain last night I examined the watermelon seeds that had washed to the surface and I noticed that they were bad seeds, so there goes the excitement of seeing them sprout before we leave. I might replace them with some fresh Rosela seeds that I bought.



We've continued to document the flora and fauna we've come across and we visited a portion of The Auroville Botanical Garden yesterday. There was a neat hedge maze the kids enjoyed, but it was so hot in the direct sun that we decided to return at a cooler time. It's interesting to me that most of the traveling that I have done has brought me to realize the prevalence of so many plant species- everywhere I seem to go I see the
Naja naja
same plants: bougainvillea, birds of paradise and related, oleander, pathos- though India is home to a great diversity of plants that I don't think I've ever seen before. Plants such as tamarind, neem, apple custard, papaya, tulsi, sandalwood, so many of which seem to be edible or useful in some other way. It's highly interesting and I have a strong desire to bring back a suitcase full of seeds that would, alas, never flourish in relatively cold and wet Washington.


That's all for this week!

Side note:
(I have decided that I do appreciate the obvious consideration in American culture in regards to driving. It is nice if a fellow traveler allows you to have the right of way when there is only a sliver of road between two large pools of water from last nights monsoon. It's nice not to be honked at so much, even if the honking is meant as a nicety, a secret language of which I am not privy. We have met a family from Virginia staying here for a year, transplants of ten years from Deli. We discussed traffic here in the south as compared to the north, where they are
Common Bluebottle
from. They shared that in the north this is far more money and disparity. With wealth often comes arrogance and as such, drivers there are far less likely to heed any mere motorbike and deaths occur far more frequently. Looks like my motorbiking in India days will not follow me on future travels northward.)

Kolam2_1
We did not see any this intricate.
An endearing feature of most all homes and places of business in this part of India are Kolam, highly symmetrical geometrical line drawings that are composed most often of curved loops and dots. They are drawn at entry ways, often decorating the streets. Thought to bring prosperity to ones home, they are redrawn with white rice powder and something that makes them sparkle each morning by Tamil women. The rice powder also invites birds and other small creatures to eat it, thus welcoming other beings into one's home and everyday life: a daily tribute to harmonious co-existence. It is a sign of invitation to welcome all into the home, not the least of whom is Lakshmi, the Goddess of prosperity and wealth. It is a matter of pride to be able to draw large complicated patterns without lifting the hand off the floor or standing up in between. Motifs may include fish, birds, and other animal images to symbolize the unity of man and beast, however we did not see any that did. Needless to say they are beautiful, some strikingly so, and I appreciate the intention behind it. We took pictures of some of our favorites, from complex to simple,
Old and new
-big and small, all variety of homes together
(mostly simple), and enjoyed making some kolam drawings on paper.

We continue to visit the beach often and have discovered a much nicer, very shallow, free of trash and predatory men beach, Banon, about mile up the road. Unfortunately, walking that extra mile in 95 degree heat proves too much to make it a daily venture. To get to the new beach, we strayed through a mixed income neighborhood in various states of repair and disrepair. The nicer houses, some of which seemed to be being built by the inhabitants, were constructed with brick and covered with sandy concrete. Several tiny grass huts remained intermixed with the larger brick homes and there were many antiquated structures as well. On the way back, we walked along the main road so as not to get lost. The majority of stores along this whole stretch of road sell old doors and some furniture. They are gorgeous hand carved/crafted works of art in many cases, though I have a thing for wood. I wish I could fit one in my suitcase...



This week we checked out the fancy pool and the kids has lots of fun playing in the water,
School girls
but decided that the beach was much more fun. They are getting so spoiled with eating out so often, especially with having their own money to spend on drinks and sugary items that they wouldn’t be eating back home, (thank’s Mimi). I have learned that most vegetarian Hindus consider fish an acceptable addition to their meals and eating chicken is also common in this region that I thought was primarily vegetarian. We played with a group of 6 to 8 year old school children at one of the Auroville schools that bus local Tamil children in and promised to go back this week. They were very curious about us and requested that we take several photos of them. They also showed us all of the edible native plants in that very area, it was highly interesting.



The scooter remains a highlight and I am always amazed at how well the journeys orchestrate themselves. You just ‘go' and any object that might seem inopportune or threatening just works its way out with satisfaction for all. It’s not in the spirit of, ‘everyone women for herself’, like I have witnessed elsewhere, but more like the expectation is that all

will have their needs met, all will get to where they need to go- the eb and flow acquiesce, allowances are made without thought and paths open up. Though it may appear to be a race akin to that of a grain a sand through an hour glass as lane markings mean little and there are often just too many people trying to get through at once, it exists as consideration even on an unconscious level. I like to picture myself as a particle, one of many, holding some loose fitting purpose, filled with joy, joy for others on the journey, zipping in and out, never feeling any need to place emotional attachment to the behavior of others. Quite unlike the ‘handwaving' good manors of the states where you feel potential obligation or upset, judgement, expectation, or mild pride- a somewhat convoluted, “ Please, go ahead. No, after you”, rather than just that they are going and how shall I adapt. I read that if an accident occurs, the public will often attack the perpetrator as though they broke a solemn rule. I also read that there is no Hindu word for 'thank you', though they occasionally say a phrase
Our favorite
Was in fornt of someones home.
that means, ""that is kindness"". I love all of the alternates in perspective.

Aspiration office
After finally settling into a very simple routine that included lots of exploring, plenty of playing, art and relaxing together at Arka, we turned in our scooter and moved this past Friday to a different guest house. The new place is beautiful and I am free of feeling unwelcome due to the disquietude that Malek and Sephina produced in such an otherwise serene environment. Where we sleep now is my idea of a the perfect room: it's uncomplicated, the widow frames, doors and all furniture are handmade solid wood, the floor is covered in spanish style tiles, and the space is small - just enough. To the surrounding villagers, this would be considered a very nice place and that is why it cost a fair amount in comparison to stay here; we subsidize the Tamil and Auroville and thus they treat us like special guests. There is a 13 year old Tamil boy, Sahnker, who lives here. He is fairly fluent in English and the kids love playing with him and the other younger children who live here as well. The local kids have also enjoyed sharing our iPad, though they are not unfamiliar with most of the games.

Yesterday
Auro Beach
we rented another scooter as I had to tie up accounting issues back in Auroville proper, a 5km walk from here. Though I've recently really enjoyed the days of walking 3km with Sephina on my back to Auro Beach and around town, it has gotten to be too much for the kids in this heat. I must say that having wheels definitely reduces stress even if we aren't getting nearly as much exercise. In the past five days we've ventured to the beach 4 times. If Malek had his way, we'd be there all day, every day. The Beach, which is said to be 'the' or one of the nicest beaches in India, reminds me of Long Beach in CA, pre-beach clean up minus seagulls and seaweed. It's littered in trash (as are the roads in general, where daily burning is observed as a means of control), and has many chunks of concrete and brick mixed with various wires and rebar. Not sure why it was decided to leave these to look like some important ancient relics of Atlantis when they're not... I have only seen men swimming in the water and they tend to be fully clothed or in
Temple for Ganesh
underwear. The women, who occasionally wade and get quite wet doing so, are in full saris. It's hard for me to keep an eye on Sephina and our stuff while in the ocean, so I have only swam once. *(Update, just got back from the beach again and enjoyed swimming somewhat far out with Sephina and Malek both. We all enjoyed diving under the gentle waves for quite a while). Though I brought a fairly modest bathing suit, I found it more respectful to swim fully clothed and so I did. The very few westerners who I have seen wearing immodest clothing, (short shorts and tank tops), stuck out like a sore thumb and it was in blatant violation of the culture. Even me in my bellow the knee shorts and modest enough t-shirts have garnered enough attention as to make some locals think they can come over and rub sand off my legs, grasp my hands or ask me if I like to drink. However, the kids love it and I foresee venturing there near daily.

Speaking of garnering attention, Sephina really does seem to be the ""Queen"" or princess of India. Since we've arrived she's received pats,
Self declared ""Queen of India""!
kisses, pinched cheeks and general adoration. People look right through Malek and I and coo and fawn over my little girl. It's happened several times at the beach where a group of twenty something men will come over and ask to have their picture taken with just Sephina. It quickly got to the point that she insisted that I was in the picture too, to hold her much to the disappointment of the young men, and now she flat out objects. I still think she liked the attention though, beyond the strangeness.

In our new neighborhood we've discovered a four lane pool at New Creation that is quite expensive to swim in, but for the kids sake, we'll probably visit it twice or thrice. We're also considering moving to that guest house as it is more affordable and according to the kids, the food here is too spicy (first complaint). Also, it's fun to move and try out the different accommodations and enjoy different environments.

Ganesh
Last Friday was Ganesh Chaturthi. This is the birthday celebration of one of India's most beloved Gods, Ganesh. Music started playing at midnight the day of, all offices were closed and fireworks rang out later that night in Pondicherry. We were told that for the most part, it is a celebration that is honored in homes and temples and not publicly, though I don't doubt that there was a public festival in Pondicherry. I read that the big festivals traditionally involve installing clay images of Ganesha in temporary shrines, which are worshipped for ten days with a variety of herbal leaves and plants to later be immersed at the end of the festival in a water, (lakes and rivers), along with the miniature Idols. Ganesh seems omnipresent here in the South East. He seems to be the primary deity, and is revered as the remover of obstacles, the god of new beginnings, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. It is recommended to place a a small statue of Ganesh facing your door so that he can remove obstacles on your behalf.

A chant of: Om Shree Ganesha Ji Gam Gam Ganapati Gaaye Namaha
Local Ganesh Shrine
- of which there are countless.
is common and translates as “Oh Great Ganesha-Ji Remover of Obstacles, we sing and salute you!” Or in other words: “Hey! Wake up the root chakra, energy of transformation, and move through obstacles. Yay!” This is reminiscent of the Buddhist quote made in the same spirit, “Each day we are born again. What we do today is what matters most"". I am especially curious about Ganesh as the as the god of new beginnings; maybe I'll buy a small statue to place near my front door for when I return - here's to fresh starts and turning them into opportunities for abundance!

www.youtube.com/watch?v=HhzGfNIKZy0 (Haven' been able to watch this, but it looks interesting).

Malek, Sephina and I took a bus into Pondicherry finally and did some small amount of exploring. The local bus from Auroville only waits 2.5 hours for our return. We didn't have any luck at all in regards to finding anything on our shopping list (tiffins, anklets, bangles, indian clothing), but we did have a run in with Lakshmi, the elephant who hands out blessings for a coin. The kids and I were enamored with his magnificence and stood gazing at him for quite a while.
Lakshim
Sephina and Malek fed him a banana each and also placed a coin into his... nostril, where he collects and holds the coins before reaching out and 'blessing' the patron with a tap from his trunk. He seemed very well cared for an adored and I doubt it is something they will ever forget. In the big city, the kids also got to experience another level of a different way of living, with clouds of pollution, mixed with the heat and humidity, contorting the smells of fresh flowers (often glorious tuberose) and raw sewage. Amplified humanity.



Otherwise we have continued to enjoy our trips excite-biking around on the scooter, especially when riding over the ""deathly death trap of doom and destruction"", (a narrow pathway that looms over a pit likely caused by a wash out, and experiencing the rich Indian animal diversity, (whether we want to or not - think giant persistent spiders in our bathroom, scorpions and whip scorpions in our room). It's all amazing and thoroughly enriching and we are all grateful to be here, even if a little homesickness and hesitancy remains.





Bellow are pictures, some of which I

August 27th 2014
Published: August 28th 2014


1219166972
August 2008. I had gone to US (Seattle) for almost a month in May, a month after the Gokarna trip. So after a long lull of 4 months, we (Neelesh, Vivek, Rahul and me) set out for Ooty in Rahul's car. Rahul's new driver Manish too had gotten kind of friendly with us. The weather was nice as it mostly is in and around Bangalore. Within no time we had crossed Mysore after a forgettable lunch at a random dhaba somewhere on the highway. The road from Mysore onward is a 2 lane one but is flanked by endless sunflower fields on both sides for a long stretch making a wonderful sight.

Somewhere on the stretch between Mysore and Bandipur, we stopped at Mahalaxmi bakery for tea and had some legendary photographs. Our next stop was Bandipur. There wasn't too long in sunset and we could not have reached Ooty the same day so we decided to stay at Bandipur. Patel had contacted a lot of hotels before setting out for the trip and was angry on me for not helping him out in the hotel finding effort. Sadly all the resorts he had contacted were either full or non-existent.
1219166990
Patel was on the verge of breaking down at the thoughts of having to spend the night in the car in the middle of a wildlife sanctuary. But then what's that trip which does not have an element of adventure in it. Then finally I took the charge, located a resort with exactly 2 rooms vacant, negotiated the rates and Patel took a sigh of relief. We dumped our bags in the room and set out for a tour of Bandipur sanctuary.

It was a place far off from city limits. The only human made things visible were the narrow roads and few vehicles. We were awestruck to spot massive herds of deer very close to the road. A little deeper into the jungle, we spotted bisons and elephants too, but the famous leopard remained elusive.

We gorged and guzzled at the resort and played cards in the night. Patel proved to be a sore loser at the game of cards. :-P

We set out for Ooty early in the morning. It was the day of Rakshabandhan too. Bandipur was the starting of the hills region. We crossed the border over to Tamil Nadu and reached the
1219166892
town of Masinagudi where we expected to meet a local guide who eventually duped us of some money. But wasting no time we continued on our climb to Ooty. We chose the steeper route on the way up. The landscape was extremely serene all the way upto Ooty. The steep road was one of the most dangerous ones I had ever been too till that time. We took several stopovers on the way up where Patel kept finding some spots and props to pose with for some photographs. Those were our pre-SLR days, but mine and Rahul's interest in photography began from that time only.

Ooty was a nice hill station with a pleasant climate, though a bit too commercialized for our liking. We did some standard sight seeing. The botanical garden turned out to be a good place. Dodda-betta or 'the big hill' was another very nice place. We could see the entire valley from there. We finished sight seeing by lunch time and after having lunch set out for Bangalore. We chose the longer and less steep route this time. This too had extremely scenic views to offer. We passed through vast stretches of tea plantations and
1219166912
forests of Chandan trees. This exactly was the area where the famous Veerappan once dwelt. It had started raining when we started the descent and continued that way for long. We could see clouds descending down on the mountains and turning into droplets of rain. There were some really nice villages and towns on this route where we stopped for tea and pakoras.

It was already dark by the time we reached Masinagudi and we weren't sure whether to continue traveling or not. But we decided to continue though it was still around 225 kms to Bangalore. We had dinner near Bandipur. We were too sleepy after that to even remember how we reached Bangalore. Thanks to Manish's swift driving we were in Bangalore much sooner than expected. We missed a lot of nice places around Ooty on this short trip and vowed to go there once again soon.

Random roadside temple
To start, we made it! The trip went as smoothly as possible, actually surprisingly so given that I was traveling with a 4 and 9 year old. There was no complaining and it was fairly easy to keep them entertained. The lengthy layover wasn’t such a big deal- they mostly spent it running back and forth on the airport walk way belt in UAE Dubai. They needed to burn off all of that extra energy and at 1 in the morning, they weren’t really in anyones way. (I was banking on empathy if they were.)



When we finally landed in Chennai, I was pleased with my decision to spend the night in Dubai and take a red eye to Chennai, as it was a tiny and old airport. We easily found our prearranged cab driver and were excited to begin the last 3 hour leg of the trip. The chaotic dance of Indian traffic fascinated the kids and I and reminded me of the many months I’d spent years ago in China. I could just picture my mother tossing herself back into her seat, face scrunched, foot pounding an imaginary break peddle during so many moments when you’re
Temple
just sure that someone is about to die, maybe you, but it always seems to work out. It seems so much trust is involved, as it is in life when you just keep moving forward during rough moments in spite of fear, doubt or hesitation. A lovely and thrilling metaphor to begin the trip with.



India is beautiful. The colors, the heat, the deep red of the soil, the lush green of the jungle, the coconuts, mangos, and unknown fruits hanging from the trees, the euphony of birds and insects, the cute little geckoes and super tiny frogs (pinky nail size), the wandering bramas, the smiles and warmth of the people and of course the food. As long as I keep the kids busy, they are both happy. Malek has on several occasions expressed his desire to return home. He is uncertain of his surroundings and is feeling insecure and has voiced that this is especially obvious when we are in our room with quiet time. So I rented a scooter to keep us moving and engaged. If I recall correctly, yesterday I heard him say that it was the most fun thing he’s ever done (also
Playground nearby
We have visited here a few times already, once we got to play here while watching Indian stick fighting match like this: http://www.kravmagaindia.in/programmes/indianlathi
the scariest). Oh and, for at least that moment, he changed his mind about India and exclaimed that, ""its great""! This energy keeps me filled with hope and gratitude. I still hear occasional complaints from him about bug bites, (I’m having a hard time warding off mosquitos) other small injuries and mostly homesickness, but for now we are here and he will adapt. I’ve opened myself to the possibility of shortening the trip down to 4-6 weeks. This was always an option, though I hope it won't be necessary- maybe it won’t be. We’ll continue to take it day by day and thus far their days have largely been filled with laughter, wonder, joy and togetherness.



Wifi has been down since we arrived and internet is very spotty, (as is electricity as it was last night when we had to sleep in a hot room without a fan), but its no problem. In fact, it’s welcomed - far fewer distractions means more time for each other; over coming perceived adversities shows us that we are adaptable, flexible and capable. Our current plan is to have the scooter for most of this week, then a few days to
Worlds cutest frog
Nyctibatrachus minimus ?
explore on foot (which means a lot of walking as things are spread pretty far apart and apparently we also have to watch out for snakes and scorpions scorpions) and next week we’ll take a local bus into Pondicherry to do a little exploring and shopping, including clothing better suited for the weather. If you were wanting us to pick you up something, now would be a good time to let me know 😊





Until next time, be well and love to you!

Time is really whizzing by with now only 4 weeks of my 15 weeks left. The General Participants fly back 2 weeks today and then we will be involved in training the new National Volunteers and possibly meeting the new Team Leaders from the UK. Sadly, although I had every good intention of becoming fluent in Tamil I still only know a few phrases and have to keep saying ""konjam Tamil"" ""Englandh"" especially when their reply to my question is different from the stock phrase of I'm fine that we have learnt! I am hoping therefore that the training we will be offering will be English lessons as I might be able to manage those :-)

It has been challenging travelling between two teams and trying to give all of the volunteers the support they require especially with 11 International and 10 National volunteers requiring my attention. Next batch they will have four team leaders and place one in each location which will make life a lot easier for everyone. However, I have been lucky enough to take part in lots of events that the teams have organised and to see the needs of two very different areas. Also, travelling on buses alone has allowed me to have conversations (or attempt conversations) that would otherwise not have occurred and to gain more of an insight into life in Southern India today. On Friday we met an entrepreneur from Nimmiyampattu who wanted to know what we were doing and if he could help us in anyway. He was amazed that we were travelling around on local buses and living very modestly, although still in luxury to many here. We do have an inside toilet and brick walls with a proper roof over our heads). When he asked us what we missed and what we would like him to provide for us we struggled for an answer. While there are times when I crave a pizza, a Sunday roast, fast internet connection, the TV, a glass of wine or reliable water and electricity I can't say as though I have really missed anything (apart from friends and family) and certainly don't feel as though I have gone without. Having this experience without having to face a few difficulties and challenges would not be the same. Just this morning we were visited by monkeys who were trying to steal our food and go through our rubbish. My housemates were able to chase them off with a stick but not before the monkeys had spilt samba all over their clean washing.

I truly believe that everyone should have an opportunity like this as it makes you value what is really important, stops you sweating about the ""small stuff"" and gives you a chance to see what the needs of the community really are and how international development is working at a grassroots level. I also feel that I now have a new found patience which I didn't know existed! Taking part in International Youth Day and attending a Gratitude Day at the girls Auxilium College in Vellore were inspiring. Hearing the girls wishes and hopes for the future showed that encouraging youth to give their voice is so important. Completing the slogans ""I can ..."" and I want ..."" many girls mentioned adopting a girl child to give them a free education; ending the dowry; helping the poor; campaigning for equality. We need to give these young people the opportunity and outlet to make these changes and achieve these goals.

Yesterday the Vellore 2 team organised a Career Fair. Although the turn out was not quite what we had hoped it was great to see many new faces at the Youth Resource Centre and to receive support from two other NGO's as well as the Panchayat leader and his crew. We even had 5 raffle prizes donated by local businesses and the Youth Leader. We hope that the next batch will be able to build on these new relationships to put on more events which will benefit the local community.

While in Vellore 1 I have found it easy to travel at the weekends and have enjoyed some much needed downtime with a weekend in Bangalore and a weekend in Mamallapuram (Mahabs). Great to see how Indians dress and act in the big city compared to the towns and villages we are working in with many girls in short skirts and tops or dresses, jeans, make up and openly smoking, dancing and drinking in the bars. Something that would be really frowned upon in any of my placements and something that felt quite odd to witness after almost nothing but girls and women wearing saris and salwars. Nevertheless, wonderful to see the freedom and presumably strength and guts to challenge the perception of women in Indian society. It was also interesting to note that they were talking to each other in English rather than Hindi or Tamil - perhaps a sign of wealth or education? It wasn't the right occasion to ask but it would be interesting to know.

Two weeks have passed since my last blog and I have spent my time travelling between my two placements - Alangayam in the mountains with a few stalls and a small bus station and Vellore City where I have a choice of restaurants and a supermarket just 5 minutes away! Although the two are very different both areas need our help and support to educate the youths of today on health and livelihoods. The team in Vellore was lucky enough to organise a health rally in Vanjur which attracted two health inspectors as speakers and 30 members of women's self-help groups. The message of Vector Borne diseases and eliminating breeding grounds for mosquitoes by using stagnant water and recycling empty containers which might hold drops of water will hopefully be disseminated amongst the villagers. The team has also been painting a new Youth Resource Centre (YRC) where young people will be able to come for advice, support, job seeking, computer skills, internet use and to use the library. We also hope to run English classes to improve job prospects and are currently trying to organise a grand opening. A new kitchen garden has also been created alongside the YRC as an example to villagers of how to use up stagnant water and provide vegetables for their families.

In Vellore 2 we caused a stir on the street of Nimmiyampattu by holding a Livelihood and health stall. After a slow start with just a few monkeys for company we were soon inundated with school children and cars, carts and bikes were stopping to find out what these crazy foreigners were up to this time. Using some barrels we found we were able to display our posters and offer advice on prevention methods for VBD's, healthy eating and how to create a CV. Children were invited to draw pictures of healthy foods and to share their career ideas. Sadly one young girl came over and was very keen to find out more about CV's and the options open to her but her husband came over, told her off and led her away. In 2014 it is hard to believe that many young women do not have the same choices open to them as in the West and that once married, for some women their whole life is dictated by their husband or their husbands’ family especially in these rural communities.

I have managed to get away for one weekend to meet up with the rest of the volunteers who are working in other parts of Tamil Nadu. We met in Kanchipuram which is famous for its many temples (like many towns in India!). While there we swapped stories of the work we have been doing and shared our frustrations of ""Indian Time"", how things never go to plan and how little time we actually have left. During our training in the UK we were told that it would be hard to see the development impact we had made in such a short space of time but personally we would notice our own development and I can certainly see this within my teams. Everyone's personal journey is different but hopefully there will be many positives, skills and remaining passion which can be used during the next month in India and to promote action at home when we return.

In Kanchipuram while visiting the oldest temple - Kailasanatha which is dedicated to Shiva I was treated to the warmest welcome I have ever had in my life. I don't think I have ever seen a group of people soooo excited to see me before in my life and I had never even met them! While walking around the temple I was met by a group of Hindu women who came towards me in a wave of colour like a rainbow of happiness! They greeted me and my fellow team leader Charlie with handshakes, kisses, smiles, blessings and one lady even hugged us into her chest. I had no idea what they were saying and they didn't seem to understand us but it didn't matter. At that moment I felt truly blessed and that I was the most important thing in their life for those few minutes. Hard to describe but a very special moment which reminds me just have remarkable human beings are and the power we have towards others just by using a smile, a greeting a glance of encouragement. Later it was wonderful to hear their singing as they walked around the temple and they invited us to share their lunch.

The second remarkable set of people I met that weekend were a couple who founded and run the charity RIDE which aims to eliminate child labour, empower women and generally support the welfare of others. Totally inspiring. Run by Mr. and Mrs. <em style=""background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-size: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-position: initial; background-repeat: initial;"">S. Jeyaraj who are are both Catholic, they basically give themselves a small amount to live off and then everything else is put back into the charity - time and money. ""Sleeping can wait"" they told me. How true! I feel re-energised and ready to take on the last 8 weeks of my time in India with renewed vigour.

A quick update on what we did on the first day of trekking. We drove into the mountains in the 'party bus' which took about two hours as we had to stop at two check points. The road through the mountains was a tad terrifying, someone compared it to the end of the Italian job. Eventually we got to our stop alive and had our lunch which was as usual curry. After much deliberation we started an hour and a half trek through the mountains which led us through a tea plantation where a few of us had a go at harvesting the tea, the ladies made it look a lot easier then it was. We continued on the walk through the mountain where a few members of the group found leeches attached to their legs, boots and on Ella her glasses. It caused a bit of hysteria and there was lots of screaming but eventually we got out of the leech area and carried on our walk to a church. After a five minute rest we started our trek to a waterfall which took about an hour. On our way to the waterfall we passed some epic scenery and crossed small rushing rivers. When we got to the waterfall the majority of us jumped in and started splashing around with an Indian family that was already there and used it as an opportunity to use the water for a much needed shower. We have some amazing photos and videos of the water cascading down. After about half an hour we got out of the water and started the trek back when the heavens opened and drenched us even more. Over the ridge of another mountain peak you could hear the thunder. We arrived back at the church and climbed on the bus to take us back to where we were staying. The trip down was less scary as the majority of us were asleep, exhaustion really did overcome fear. Once we'd got back to the accommodation, which involved navigating through a festival welcoming the new season, we dried off eventually and were given the chance to go into town. After yet again more curry, which was actually not that spicy, and a really sweet tea we where given another quiz of which the prize was pizza. After the quiz we attempted to get to sleep but that was easier said then done as the festival didn't stop until well after midnight and there was no air-con in the rooms. Laters. Hope and Ivor.

We're sure you're all wondering how your delightful offspring/relatives/friends/donation-pesterers are doing in India and so the staff have compiled the following report for your delectation.

Collectively they've been superb all trip and been an absolute credit to you all. They've embraced the endless pit-digging with aplomb; have eaten the varied curried dishes with delight; have danced as if they haven't got 2 left feet and have embraced Indian life with open minds. As such, they've been very easy for the staff to look out for and there's a great collective spirit in the group.

Whilst that's all lovely, we're sure you're more interested in how the students are doing individually, so there's a few words below on each of them.

In no particular order, we'll start with Naomi. Despite injuring her knee, she has been impressing the group with the hard work she's putting in on the site and with her determination to contribute. Her knee has been getting better and the group have been really supportive in making sure she doesn't put it under any strain. Throughout it all, Naomi has been her normal, bubbly and optimistic self.

Cristina has an innate ability to communicate well with all the people we've met. Her gesticulation skills are legendary and she is well known around the Deaf School. If we want to explain something to an Indian, Cristina is our interpreter of choice.

Carensa has had to balance the disappointment of grazing her knee badly with the celebration of becoming a member of the English Korfball squad. As with Naomi, she's on the mend.

Ivor has taken on the role of Official Restaurant Critic and is far from reticent at airing his views on sloppy service. He is also running a monopoly on refridgeration services, as he has an air con unit on the floor of his room, which chills drinks. This has kept both him and Archie in Oreos and Mountain Dew.

Archie is seemingly loving every minute of the trip. He practices Indian dance routines at every opportunity and is revelling in the new opportunities he's finding himself in. His singing is heavenly and he's really been affected by the differing lifestyles of the students we've come into contact with.

Nathaniel has been an upbeat and confident member of the group during the project work that we've been doing. He enjoys singing inspirational musical numbers to the group whilst partaking in a rather modern phenomenon called twerking. The thought of Nathaniel continuing to do this, inspires the groups to work harder.

Hope has had a great time so far and has become more confident and at ease as the trip has continued. She was deeply affected by a recent visit to an old people's home and organised a whip-round amongst the group, which meant that we funded the home's meals for nearly 2 months.

William has emerged as the joker in the pack. So far he has demonstrated the ability to interpret dance routines in his own unique way and has had the locals in tears at his endeavours. He's forgotten Malcolm and Claire's names, coining them Nigel and Saucy Sue, for reasons only known to himself. He is loving wearing the Longhi (Indian man-skirt) a little bit too much and wears it at every possible opportunity.

Molly has been given the title of Princess by the rest of the group and has twice been asked by children if she would marry them! She's always smiley and positive and has worked really well on the project.

Jodie has been unfortunate in coming on the trip with Danielle, who has blabbed about her previous boyfriends. Jodie has given as good as she's got though and is having a great time. She's been working tirelessly, digging a pit that was then named Brad.

Jake is throwing himself whole-heartedly into every activity and has really enjoyed the experience so far. The staff have tried to come up with a single criticism of Jake and he's seemingly faultless. Bearing in mind some of the critical staff present that is some achievement.

Ella has really developed in confidence as the trip has progressed and has become more comfortable with the surroundings and the total change in lifestyle. She's worked well on the activities.

Alberta has giggled throughout much of the trip and really made an impression on the Bishop when we were invited to a celebration dinner at his palatial home. She often has to be marshalled by her younger sister Rebecca.

Ellie has been making large improvements on the project as the weeks continued. At first, she found it difficult but she's now amongst the most improved participant and has developed her digging, shovelling and carrying skills. She's often found with the same group of girls on site who like a good sing-song.

Rebecca proved herself to be a very effective and demanding leader on her day in the role. She was the first leader to introduce punishments for misdemeanours which led to Mr Lill and Miss Eyres having to sing 'If you're happy and you know it' on the coach. She can often be found being responsible for her older sister Alberta.

Sian is ridiculously hard-working and has to be told to have a break at times. She has worked tirelessly and is happy getting stuck in to the more laborious and demanding tasks. She's been positive throughout and is also a regular member of the Tirunelveli Running Club (Formed 2014).

Sam is another grafter. On one day, he worked so hard that he almost worked himself to a sleeping standstill. He seems to have had an absolute ball whilst he's been here and has embraced the work and leisure opportunities fully. Always cheery, his ability to sleep in awkward plastic chairs, small coaches, horrible beds etc is to be marvelled at.

Danielle has bored many with her talk of Ian. She has also been bubbly and charismatic throughout and is happy to talk about Jodie's love-life. She's worked really well and has been positive throughout.

Rosy is the person that all the little children gravitate towards. She is constantly playing and encouraging them and we're all convinced one particular boy is going to smuggled into her rucksack before we leave. Her kind and caring nature is obvious and her consideration for others is fantastic.

Fran has been engaged in the project from that start and proved to be a really driven and direct leader on her day in the role. She was a good negotiater and had many successes on her leadership day. She is also the only person to have fallen in one of our freshly dug pits, thankfully unhurt and giggling away.

Sophie has struggled with the food but news of a supermarket that sells lots of Western products lifted her spirits and gave her lots to choose from. Although, it may not be a wholly balanced diet. She's been great on the project site and has got along with the rest of the group really well.

Matthew has been consistent throughout - dedicated, hard-working, driven and considerate. He's always been one of the students to graft throughout the day and has enjoyed the experience so far.

Izzie has enjoyed getting out and meeting the people of India, through the school visits and other cultural experiences. She's really enjoyed the dance routines we've been taught and is often one of the loudest singers during our 'Lean on Me' and 'Doe a Deer' renditions.

Alisha has developed in confidence as the trip has progressed and has really come out of her shell. Like Izzie, she has really enjoyed the dancing routines and gets into the practice. With Izzie, she was part of an ultra-organised and efficient leadership team.

Beth has been really working hard throughout our time at the site. She's not afraid in getting stuck in, getting grubby and ordering others around, where needed. She was particularly impressive during our football matches against the students from the deaf school.

Bryan is always on site, desperate to work and to learn new things. He's been well respected by the Indian builders for his ability to get stuck in and they often turn to him if they need a hand. He has impressed the group with the huge amount of work he gets through.

Ben is currently revelling in his role of performing monkey; balancing objects on his face at every opportunity. This has included garden chairs, shovels, metal poles, flasks etc. He's always involved in the physical activities on site despite being a fairly terrible morning person.

And finally, James. Will never miss an opportunity to wear a vest and show off his arms. If he could walk around with his top off all day he would. Works hard on site, almost as hard as he works on his tan. Has learnt some valuable lessons. Such as 'don't boast that the staff can't get you wet.' Then sunbath directly in front of the roof. 1 bucket later, lesson learnt.





There's loads more we could say about all of them, but we'll probably have a powercut soon and we don't want to tempt fate. Needless to say, they are all in good spirits, are fit and healthy (or well on the mend) and have been an absolute pleasure to share this experience with.

Please note: We are going on a trek for 3 days, so internet usage may be lacking. So the blog may be unmanned until Sunday evening.

Today we did more project work, on arrival we were informed that there were not many jobs and that 2 further holes had to be dug for a decorative arch inside the church! We started at 9:15, moral was low due to the 2 new holes and having to move back dirt that we hade previously dug out of the other holes. We tried to divide the group into teams so that all he jobs can be done well and everyone can have breaks but this unfortunately this didn't work as some jobs required more people that others meaning people were not having very long breaks. Eventually we got it all sorted, moral had picked up and everyone was working hard until the builders walked past with new tools that we had been requesting from the beginning and toke them to another building site! the team was very frustrated so we had an early lunch!

In the afternoon some students went to sarah tucker primary school, an all girls school just down the road, to teach the children. Those that went to sarah tucker taught the children some nursery rhymes and others remained on the building site, this meant that it was a lot more efficient as there were fewer people so more jobs to go around and more frequent breaks! . After this everyone had free time to do as they pleased! In the evening we had a western dance lesson.

Highlight of the day: Rosie sat on her bed in the evening and it folded in half due to her previously removing the support leg :P

Overall, despite initial difficulties, it was a really productive day!

After waking up on Tuesday and getting ready for a morning on the project site we were informed that unfortunately due to a missing engineer we were unable to work, so we made the most of a chilled few hours before hitting the local swimming pool! We all had a tonne of fun messing about in the pool and lazing around on the grass, resulting in several salmon coloured students (and teachers!!!) with one of the days team leaders even donning a rather funky sunglasses tan!! We headed back home for lunch (curry, obviously) before visiting a school for children with quite severe special needs, which many of us found to be a very difficult and emotional experience. Although it was reassuring to know that there was a place that was able to help and provide an education for the children, it made us all appreciate the care and support that is offered at home. To end our visit, we sung for the children in their assembly and they put on a dance and several songs for us which was lovely! We arrived back home for a quick freshen up before heading off to the bishops house for dinner, where much to our surprise a banquet reassembling a wedding had been laid on, to which most of us turned up in our scruffs (oops!!) excluding the boys in their new indian suits and especially Mr Wood who rocked up in a glitzy, dazzling suit looking rather like a panto genie! We all enjoyed the feast that had been laid on for us, in particularly Will who headed straight up for seconds, CLASSIC WILL! We also put on our second performance of the day singing at the dinner, where we sounded like angels completely showing up the other school who attended who put on a last minute rather awful twinkle twinkle little star performance!

All in all a great day!!

Lots of love Danielle and Jodie (team leaders for the day) xxx

We just wanted to add a quick update from us as staff on the trip - we are ao incredibly proud of all the students they are doing amazingly well, embracing everything that India is throwing at them and rising to the challenge with smiles on their faces. We could not ask for a better bunch of students to be with us. We are so proud of all of them. We have had an emotional roller coaster of a day (blog will be updated tomorrow by students) and have all realised why we are here doing what we are doing. They are all changing and growing as the days go on and are making such a difference to so many peoples lives.

Hi all, I'm having an amazing time and have actually managed to not burn as of yet! We've done so much in just one week, the highlight being getting blessed by an elephant in a Hindu temple (Mum, don't be jealous 😉 ). Don't worry, my knee is holding up - I'll email you with an update when I can. Part of me misses the rain, and I think we're all struggling with the lack of cold water!

India is good. More blisters and curry than I thought possible. Comment the girls measurements and I may be able to get them a saree if they want.

Ella:
Hi everyone, I would say that I'm missing you but then I would be lying (joking!!!). As I am writing this now, we are all working hard and keeping moral high. Here we are literally putting blood sweat and tears into this project, but it has been worth it as we have already accomplished so much. If the next two weeks are anything like this first one, then it is going to be such an amazing experience. Though I have to say, greatly missing cold water and I won't be eating a curry again any time soon when we get home!!! Hope you all are okay, and to my uncle & Amy, hope you both have a lovely birthday!!!

It's finally Sunday and after a week of laborious, back-breaking work we finally got a day of rest. Early on we hopped on the 'party bus' and headed for a day on the town. When we had finally arrived we were met by the towering superstore Pothy's which if described as busy would have been a major understatement: it was worse than Primark on Oxford Street, on Boxing Day! The girls had the luxurious however claustrophobic experience of buying their sarees and then we quickly headed back to our meeting point at the entrance of the temple. After removing our shoes and entering the temple we were treated to the wondrous settings of ages long past. What could be called maze like, the temple was decorated with statues and towering columns. It was beautiful yet eerie. As we turned the corner we were greeted by an elephant. We had the opportunity to get out our rupees and give them to the elephant which then gave us all a pat on the head in the form of a blessing. After leaving the temple, we had a short time to browse other stalls in town before heading back to the school. After this we had some free time which the majority of people spent at the local supermarket before having the exciting treasure hunt in the evening- as a reward the winners got an ice cream cake, yum! Overall it was a relieving day from work. - Ella and Archie.

Just a quick update, everything is going well and we are currently enjoying out day off. Haven't had much time to update recently as we've been working hard and enjoying ourselves, plus electricity and therefore access to the internet has been dodgy! Hopefully once we return from our temple visit and shopping there will be further updates.

As the week came to a close, our previous efforts caught up to us and the exhaustion was obvious. We all struggled to continue our laborous digging of the chapel foundations, however the idea of the happiness the chapel would bring to the children, school and community encouraged us to power on. We were all moved today by a young boy boarding at the school. As well as being deaf he has learning difficulties, finding it difficult to communicate and even smile. Yet, as we have witnessed through Rosy's bond with the young child, there has been significant improvement and have even seem him begin to smile. In the evening the teachers treated us to a meal out at the top Indian restaurant in the town. The food was amazing, despite the difference in service compared to at home. Many got their mains before their starters! Whilst many found this frustrating, we soon realised how lucky we were to be able to have food at all, let alone eat out. The realisation that Silvia, the lady who serves us food at the school, was only able to join us due to the teachers generosity hit us hard. She lives off of £50 a year and therefore cannot afford such a luxury. I think it's agreed that the highlight of the day was when we got tuktuks from the restaurant back to the deaf school. They were terrifying, yet it was so fun that it is definitely an experience we want to do again! It's our rest day on Sunday, and we all cannot wait to have a break and do some shopping. Hope all is well at home, talk to you soon, lots of love Izzie and Alisha xxx

Greetings. The troops were allowed an extra hours rest to attempt to retain energy. More holes today, will they ever end? We are up to twelve holes and everyone was ready to get stuck in. We managed to overcome a lack of equipment issue so everyone was working at maximum capacity. Although our best efforts the local workers put us all to shame with their non-stop work and their years of experience with the pole. Overall progress was better than ever before and the great help from the co-leaders pushed everyone forward. After a hard day’s work we were able to let off some steam like any Indian would and dance till our legs gave way. Some dancers were much more creative than others with their interpretations of the local dance. After a good laugh we were allowed to spend some time with the local students; playing football, socialising, taking pictures and attempting to communicate with them. The student’s interpretation of a ‘friendly’ was very different from ours; we took casualties but nothing the troops couldn’t handle. Some of the girls went off to the female quarters; the students were more interested in their cameras than them. As all good days must end we went out with a bang singing in the chapel rehearsing our songs until they were pitch perfect. Finally some much needed sleep was granted and another great day recorded by all.



Talk to you all soon



Lots of love



Will and Carensa (the best leaders to date)

With stern words from the teachers to start the day earlier, we all woke at 7am, for a 7.30 breakfast. This allowed the work to be completed whilst the temperature was cooler. Despite many tired faces everyone got on with all the tasks we set them to complete and started making real progress. The local workers arrived to give us a hand, promising digging machines which never arrived. They made up for it as they worked like absolute machines. With a lot of tired bodies after almost 5 hour’s hard work, we stopped for a 1.30 lunch to get some well needed energy back. We started the demolition derby at 2.30, were we knocked down the buildings around the holes and of course continued digging the holes. We stopped at 4, although we were all exhausted we all had a great sense of achievement when we stood back and saw what we had completed. We freshened up and then headed to town, where we were shown the local shops. Due to our hard work and efforts over the past two days the teachers rewarded us by taking us all to the ice cream shop and treating us to an ice cream each. We then had free time to explore the shops and by 7.30 everyone was sitting down for dinner. Singing rehearsals started at 9, where we were all thoroughly entertained by Miss Eyre and Mr Wood’s enthusiasm, they were equally shocked with our singing capabilities. Overall a brilliant day and we are tremendously proud of our team and hope we keep up with the work.



Laters all will see you when we get back,



Lots of love,

Hello all, today has been another fantastic day filled with hard work. Everyone worked through the heat digging holes, knocking down buildings (and with a touch of OCD from many of us), cleared rubble in an organised fashion! we are currently sitting outside our rooms enjoying the night breeze playing many different games of cards. The team leader of the day will give a full review of the today, tomorrow, so continue watching this space. Hope is all well in the UK, (well actually we hope it is raining so you can be jealous of our glorious sun!!)

Goodbye and goodnight 😊

Hello everyone!!



Today we started the project; we all are exhausted but so proud of ourselves. We started of the day with noodles, YUM! Shortly after we headed to the building site, there we were told that we were extending the back of the chapel for the school. This entailed digging 5ft holes, knocking down walls and making a ramp for a lorry. During the work, the sun was beaming, but we kept hydrated and smothered in sun cream however it did result in a few smelly students. Whilst being here we have had time with the children which have made us all realised why we are here and why we want to make a difference. After this a football match kicked off between us and the school, which lead to a 2-1 defeat. Before dinner we went to the schools chapel and we were taught sign language, which will help us communicate with the children who are all completely deaf. Right now we are all relaxing playing cards and reflecting on how lucky we are at home, and how we can make a difference.



Lots of love



Jake & Rosy (Project Leaders for the day)

Hi guys,



We have finally, after a 32 hour journey, arrived at the deaf school in Tirunelveli. The plane journeys went like clockwork however after arriving in Trivandrum we ended up waiting at the airport for another 4 hours waiting for the coach which did eventually turn up…9 hours later…when we had already left. This did however allow us to get an eye opening experience of an Indian taxi driving on Indian roads. We have never heard so much beeping in our lives and the way these guys drive is incredible (incredibly scary). We arrived at our destination at about 1ish and although we were all completely knackered we were pleasantly surprised. We had lunch and ate like kings, surprise surprise it was rice and curry. We are certainly getting used to this after having it as our meals on both planes as well. The rooms are...habitable. The beds are basically a sheet of metal and the water/electricity turns completely off at random times but after a hard day’s work I am sure we are going to appreciate these commodities. We are very much looking forward to starting work tomorrow and will be sure to keep updating the blog to keep you all informed.



Love you all

It has now been 5 weeks since I left the UK and started my summer of volunteer work in India with ICS and Restless Development. So far there have been ups and downs, frustrations and challenges but I am pleased with the work we have achieved within the local communities and hope to build on this over the coming months. Life in India this time around is very different to my holiday in the North four years ago. For a start the Tamil Nadu region feels like I'm in a different country especially with the different language. While we had a few Tamil lessons during training I have only managed to master a few basic words and sentences and being understood is a real effort. Sign language and mime help but the difficulty is exacerbated by the different writing and having 247 letters in the Tamil alphabet! If only the buses had signs in Tamil and English it would make my life so much easier!

After just over two weeks training in Chennai we moved to our placement districts to begin the real work. I have two placements called Vellore 1 and 2 but for the moment I am in Vellore 2 in a town called Alangayam. It is lovely being surrounded by mountains and we are lucky in that it is a few degrees cooler here than in was in Chennai which definitely makes a difference for having a good night's sleep. The placement house is basic but functional. We only have 5 beds for 6 of us and water is scarce with regular power cuts. We use a bucket for washing ourselves and our clothes and have a small gas hob with two rings for cooking. Sadly the first few days we suffered a cockroach infestation, rat droppings and flooding but hopefully these are sorted now with just the odd cockroach to be seen. If we run out of water we can go to the end of the road and get some more from the local well. As it is so precious we have all become much more aware of how much water we use and how we take it for granted so we try to conserve as much as possible. I can now have a bucket wash and wash my hair with about a quarter of a bucket of water! I will definitely be using less when I get home. Safe drinking water for us is available through cans of treated water but many people get ill here through drinking the tap water. When we had a meeting at the primary health clinic we were told that through our work we should encourage more people to boil their water before drinking it to reduce the number of cases of diarrhea.

For 10 days we lived with a host family in a smaller village in Vallipattu about a 45 min bus journey from Alangayam and about 30 mins from Nimmiyampattu where we go to work in the Youth Resource Centre. We were split between two families - one of the boys and two girls in each. In my house we had Parameshwari, her husband Ranjan, two sons - Dhileep and Deepan and a daughter Deepika. They were very welcoming and although communication was hard we really enjoyed our time with them. Food is very important in India and we did have a few problems with not eating enough! The food was delicious but we just couldn't eat in the quantities they wanted us to. Cries of 'eating, eating' from Parameshwari came at every meal and not being able to serve yourself meant lots on your plate. I particularly enjoyed the chapattis which I would love to learn how to make but was not keen on eating spicy peas and potatoes at breakfast!

During our stay in Vallipattu we worked in our teams - livelihoods and health. The livelihood team were able to run a CV stall for Out of School Youths and the Health Team found and created a Kitchen Garden. This is a fantastic example of how communities can use up stagnant water safely to prevent the breeding of mosquitoes and Vector Borne Diseases as well as create a source of food for the family. Women workers in the fields only earn 100 rupees a day for 6 hours work 6 days a week so extra food would be welcome. We have dug the garden and planted the seeds and hope it will be an inspiration to others. Both teams met with the local headmaster and we delivered two sessions on health and livelihoods to 9th standard students (ages 13-14). We used Non Formal Education techniques (NFE) and they were well received. Last Saturday was Restless Development Values Day which we celebrated at the YRC in Nimmiyampattu. We drew the values on a big white sheet and invited the local youths and children to celebrate with us by signing their name or placing their hand print on the sheet. We were lucky enough to have a visit from the local Panjat leader so a fantastic opportunity to get ourselves known within this community. Over the coming weeks we hope to do more work in the YRC and make better use of this resource.

Socially we were lucky enough to be invited to an Indian wedding. This was a fabulous opportunity to get dressed up and learn more about Indian culture firsthand. The girls enjoyed wearing saris although they are much harder to put on than you realise. When we were staying with Parameshwari Alice and I were lucky enough to try some on and realised how important they are to Indian women. Each one seems to tell a story and Parameshwari was able to tell us how old each one was and for what occasion they were bought. Hers were beautiful silk but we went for cheap and cheerful as it might be the one and only time we get to wear them. Contrary to belief they are also very hot due to the sheer amount of fabric used!

We all attended the wedding in the evening and enjoyed a nice meal and the opportunity for a photograph with the happy couple. The next day, Barry and I got up early to see the actual wedding ceremony itself which was held between 6 and 7.30am! A band played throughout and people were arriving during the ceremony. Towards the end we all threw rice over each other and there was a mad dash which turned out to be to get to breakfast first! As I told you before, Indians love their food!

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Nagapattinam
June 25th 2014
Published: June 25th 2014


Sunrise at Tranquebar
Tranquebar, now known as Tharangambadi, meaning a place of the singing waves in Tamil, is a tiny dot on the coastal Tamil Nadu…much less known compared to its more famous neighbours…Trichy or Thanjavur or even Nagapattinam. Once in the news after devastating tsunami in 2005, Tranquebar today is only worth a brief stop-over for tea for people flocking to Karaikal, Nagapattinam on work or on pilgrimage to Thirunallar (known for its Shani temple) or Nagor (famous dargah for Muslims) or Velankanni, a major catholic attraction. There's nothing much touristy about Tranquebar, the place needs to be experienced, savoured in slow speed for soaking into its past.

We flew down to Chennai and headed to Tranquebar for reviewing a project with the local fisher folks. After crossing the city's suburb of Thiruvanmayur, the traffic started getting little thinner as we zipped down the East Coast Road to reach Mamallapuram (erstwhile Mahaballipuam), a must-see for anyone visiting Chennai. Travelling all along the coastal corridor, we crossed Pondicherry, Cuddalore, Chidambaram (famous for its Nataraja temple), Sirkali and finally reached Tranquebar, a good 275 Kms. south of Chennai. As we entered Tranquebar, the place appeared like a sleepy fishing village with the surplus fish
'Dansborg', the fort built in 1620 AD
from day's catch getting dried in every possible open space. One could spot the fishing nets in for mending, outboard engines for the boats to be serviced, large plastic crates & boxes for fish storage in most of the houses. We drove past the village and entered the erstwhile Danish settlement through an arched gate…the colonial past of Tranquebar came alive with the Missionary schools, Lutheran churches, old cemetery, Bishop's house as we neared the old fort.

Far from its today's sedate existence, Tranquebar was a prominent chapter in the colonial history of India dating back to early 17th. century AD. Along with Serampore in West Bengal and Nicobar in Andaman & Nicobar Islands, Tranquebar was a Danish settlement, which assumed importance for spice trade. On behalf of Danish King, Christian IV, an admiral from Danish navy, Ove Gjedde signed a treaty in November 1620 with King Vijaya Raghunatha Nayak from Tanjore. The Danes were looking for building a port at Tharangambadi for exporting pepper to Denmark – the Indian black gold, which had titillated the European taste buds otherwise used to bland food. A 10-mile by 3-mile strip of fishing village was rented by the Danes by paying
Dansborg Fort, a closer view
a sum of Rs.3111/- per annum and renamed as Tranquebar.

The treaty with Tanjore King paved the way for founding Danish East India Company in 1620 and the construction of the fort, known as Fort Dansborg started immediately. The fort, completed in 1622, housed the residence and operational headquarters of the Governor and other officials, who ruled Tranquebar for over 200 years. The fort had several rooms, which were used for barracks, warehouse, kitchen and also a jail. The fort has a fairly high rampart and facing the Bay of Bengal on the east, there stands a two storied building. While its vaulted lower storey was used as the armoury and a warehouse, the upper storey had a church and it also accommodated the Governor, senior merchants and the chaplain. On three sides, the fort was protected by a moat and by sea on the east...the moat has now sadly disappeared.

The British gained control of Tranquebar in 1845 after buying out the Danish settlements in India and occupied the fort along with 13 brass canons mounted on its ramparts. Tranquebar was a busy port till then but gradually lost all its importance as Nagapattinam was connected by
Seabeach at Tranquebar
railway in due course of time. Fort Dansborg, now under care of the Archaeology department of Tamil Nadu Government, houses a small museum of artifacts all retrieved from its past.

Besides its role in spice trade, Tranquebar marked two other important milestones in India's history. Protestantism came to India for the first time in Tranquebar as two German missionaries had arrived there in 1706 deputed by the king of Denmark for pastoral services. One of them, Bartholomeus Zeigenbalg turned out to be a great Tamil scholar later. From Tranquebar Protestantism later spread to Cuddalore, Thanjavur and Chennai. Thanks to the Danish rulers, the Zion Church and New Jerusalem Church were built 1n 1701 and 1718 respectively. Zeigenbalg translated the Bible into Tamil and also into Hindustani. But as the Danish set up a printing press in India in 1712 at Tranquebar, it had a far greater ramification! Over 300 Tamil books were printed here and that certainly helped adding wings to modern education system in South India.

We stayed at the 'Bungalow on the beach', a property owned by the famed Neemrana Group of non-hotel hotels from New Delhi…as the name suggests the property is smack on the
Fishermen on the beach
beach with the sea merely a few steps away from its boundary wall. The bungalow, built around 150 years ago, was rented and used by the British Collector. Due to its proximity to the sea, the bungalow had undergone extensive damages. Two years of conservation efforts with a budget of Rs.15 million restored the bungalow in its present shape. Stone, mortar, wood & glass were used in rebuilding the bungalow…all this contributed to preserve its colonial character.

Interestingly, the rooms in the hotel are not numbered; they are named after the ships that docked at Tranquebar port during its Danish past. We stayed at the room christened as Countess Moltke on the first floor; our room overlooked the hotel's garden but a small turn around the veranda…voila, we were facing the roaring Bay of Bengal! The room had a 15-foot high ceiling with all wooden beams & battens…the door itself was 10-foot tall. Hard wood flooring, four-post solid wood cot and other furniture added a period touch to the room…the toilet was not too spacious, though it was very clean and functional. Unlike its excellent locale and looks, the restaurant in Bungalow on the Beach left us a little
Bungalow on the beach
disappointed. We asked for grilled fish with boiled vegetables served with some bread for dinner on the first day - it was passable. The breakfast next day was minimalist – canned juice, cornflakes, bread, butter/jam, eggs, banana, tea/coffee. We tried Indian food for our second dinner: chicken chettinadu & squid masala both served with plentiful of steam rice...the dishes were too hot with generous use of black pepper!

I had read somewhere about the sunrise in Tranquebar…we got up early not to miss the event next day. Our hearts sank…the sky was cloudy but as the sun rose over the clouds with the hues of orange & red and their reflections on the placid early morning sea, I got busy with the camera to capture the moment! We walked out into the beach…adjoining the boundary wall of our hotel, on one corner of the beach stands Masilamani Nathar temple built in 1305 AD, an ancient temple of Lord Shiva now lying abandoned after extensive damages by the advancing sea - the ruins are strewn all around. Huge boulders have been dumped near the temple to check the erosion by the sea but that has spoiled the beauty of the
New Jerusalem Church built in 1718 AD
beach. The short strip of beach below the fort's rampart had many fiberglass fishing boats perched on it. As we strolled back to our hotel, the fort was awash in the morning sun, the gentle laps of waves caressed the shore…the gulls hovered for a hunt and the boats started their sorties into the sea hoping for a good catch…another day had begun in Tranquebar oblivious of its glorious past!

Kodaikanal a Heaven just 500 Km from Chennai

I wanted to escape Chennai’s typical tropical climate so thought of spending weekend at kodaikanal.

Kodaikanal is roughly 500 km from Chennai. Rail is always a better and faster alternative but thanks to Indian railway citizen Torture Corporation I couldn’t get tickets and Reached Madurai via bus which was very tiring. I wanted to make to kodaikanal but was very tired so decided to take a break at Madurai.

Took a bus to kodaikanal sharp at 5:40 in morning everything was going as per plan when the bus broke down somewhere in between. We pushed the bus both in forward and backward direction but it was defying all logic. We did everything except tilting it by 30 degrees just like we used to start our Bajaj scoter. The bus conductor said that the next bus will be there in another 1 hour. The possibility of getting lift was very vague as everybody was standing on the road for lift. So I decided to walk down to nearest village which was like 2 KM and outside a small eating joint I could spot a Lorries and bolero. The bolero guy flatly
IMG_0161
refused saying that he is on official trip but the lorry guy couldn’t refuse me flatly. After a lot of persuasion sales guy who was out to distribute supari agreed to drop me to certain point cautioning me that he will be stopping frequently which was ok by me. So we set out taking frequent breaks on this astonishing green paradise. I have been to lot of hill station in north but I have never seen such greenery, such a competition to outgrow each other. Big jack fruit tree, creepers were all there this was like a typical tropical rainforest.As we started to ascend the flora changed to coniferous tree. I have to admit that this was the first time I have seen eucalyptus at such elevation. Finally I got a bus and reached kodaikanal. I had to double up my T-shirt as it was cold there .the temperature would be 18 – 20. A nice cold breeze was making it very pleasant. Just decide to take a stroll to various spots. Walked through a buzzing street market where vegetable, fruits and various items of day today use were being sold. I had read that KodaiKanal Lake is man-made and
IMG_0167
all the previous man-made lake in hill stations I have encountered were size of small pond but not this one this is big lake having circumference of roughly 3 km to 4 km. A lot of activity was going on in and outside of lake. My next stop was a fall which is close to the lake .Coaker's Walk was the one which I liked most. Explaining the view at Coaker's Walk in words is just not possible you have to experience it.I spend most of the day there itself as it was the best panoramic view of plains with massive lake, small hills, forest which I have seen so far. I will rate this hill station as better than Shimla, manali, ranikhet and nanital.The commercialization hasn’t destroyed the beauty of the place as it has happened to all the hill station in north. As a matter of fact I went to ranikhet two years back which is supposed to be less commercialized and it was very hot there.

Massive deforestation for building hotels and resort have almost killed all the hill stations in north



In evening took a bus to Madurai which was very crowded.
IMG_0168
A guy sitting on floor pointed me too a vacant seat I asked him to take it but instead he asked me to go ahead. It was inexplicably generous I took his pic as and he is part of the pics I am putting here. At Madurai while going to mattuthavani bus stand a cute 10 month old guy was pulling my t-shirt and trying to strike conversation. He is also part of the pics I am putting here.Took a bus from mattuthavani bus stand for Chennai and was back to the world of heat, humidity, and sweat.

I came to know about this observatory at kavalur which is operated by Indian institute of astrophysics. Kavalur observatory is located in Kavalur in the Javadi Hills in Alangayam, Vellore District. The Kavalur Observatory is located in a 100 acre forest land in Tamil Nadu which is strewn with a variety of greenery of tropical region and is known for the highest concentration of various species of snakes in India. The doors of this observatory are open for general public on Saturday evening. So decide to avail this opportunity. The observatory is located at Javadu hills right in the middle of thick forest called Amrithi. The nearest railway station is vaniyambadi.where only few trains stop by. The major nearest rail junction is katpadi which is 3 kilometers from bustling major town Vellore. From Vellore you can take a bus to vaniyambadi which should take like an hour. Avoid taking bus to alangayam from vellor (which I did in my last trip) as the bus will go through villages at max speed of 10 km/hr and it can take like four hours. whereas you can go to vaniyambadi via national highway which will take an hour and half and then take bus
IMG_0042
to alangayam from vaniyambadi which should take like another half an hour.

So all set planned to board the train Brindavan express which start from Chennai central at 7:50 am

Reached station at 7:30 took the general ticket and straight to reserved compartment. The compartment was heavily crowded there was no place to stand and then every now and then vendor s was passing by and the only way out was to move clockwise on your axis so that they can pass. It was irritating me so using previous experience in such situation I asked one of the guys to close the door and after closing the door there was ample space for two guys to sit on the floor.

It was very comforting. I never knew that the train will stop at vaniyambadi I had ticket till katpadi only but my fellow passengers insisted that I should get down at vaniyambadi.

So got down at vaniyambadi the bus station and only major market is just 500 meters from vaniyambadi railway station. There was a Sarvanan bhavan near bus stand and I decided to saapadu(Lunch).

The food was simply amazing topped it up with a
IMG_0044
lassi and I was all set for the excursion.

Took bus to alangayam it was heavily crowded it took us half an hour to reach alangayam.

From here I had to take another bus to kavalur the frequency is very less got some time to take snap of day today activity going around the bus stand. Iron was being smelted and casted via hammering fresh flowers being sold, firewood dosa and paratha ready to be served. One thing which I can spot around were smiles. happiness was in the air. While I was taking the pics and interacting an elderly lady selling flowers shouted that the bus about to leave will go Kavalur.I had to chase the bus and managed some space next to the driver.This place was good for taking snap as the bus moved on the kavalur the road was covered with gulmohar trees who were on full blooms the field were green and orchard were laden with ripened mango. There was nice fragrance in air. javadu hills are covered by agrarian villages hard working community which has cleared the forest and established farm at hills slope.



Reached at 2:30 the guard asked
IMG_0049
me to come at 6:30 then only the visibility will be good since it was still 4 hours I decide to visit falls in amrithi forest area. For Amrithi forest I had to go to 12 Km ahead to a small village known as Jamuna mattur luckily got lift on bike. The bike was in bad shape with shockers almost gone but still the guy was generous enough to take me along. After reaching Jamuna mattur had to trek through the village. Jamuna mattur is a beautiful village and suddenly everybody was kind enough to pose for my camera right from elderly ladies who threw their sickles on ground and tucked their sarees , to Kids playing cricket and cattle’s who were busy grazing. This seemed to be a big farming community growing everything right from fruits to vegetables and seasonal crops. After trekking for around 3 Km reached the forest gate which is not guarded and then went on towards the fall. The fall was dry but seeing the rocks it can be judged that it will be massive in rains. The rocks are very slippery here and locals told me that accidents happen if proper precautions are not

taken. There were so many butterflies that the forest can very well be made a butterfly park. There were lots of earth mound where snakes can live locals worship these mounds. They often tie red color cloth around the mound and offer milk to snake at some places trishul was also put in the mound. I was back at kavalur observatory at 6:00 PM and was asked to wait for another half an hour. After it was dark we were allowed in the gates the battery of my camera was used up so can’t take the snaps. It was amazing feeling. inside the gate it was total dark there was lot of buzzing sounds of the insect which was mysterious and thrilling at the same time and just imagining that you are in a very small place with electric fencing right in the heart of 100 acre forest was very liberating. Fireflies were all around and of course the thought of snake next to my feet was there in my mind I enquired the guards how they handle these big snakes they told that most of the time they take round of the observatory in the car and the snakes
IMG_0060
even if they appear they simply pass by and disappear in the valley. The telescope was all set first it was the turn to see moon. The craters of moon were clearly visible. Then Jupiter with four moons was an Amazing spectacle in the sky has to admit that Jupiter with four moons will remain with me all my life.



Saturn’s ring was clearly visible and then came the turn of mars. Overall it was an amazing experience took the last bus from the observatory to Vaniyambadi at 8:45.

Visiting the princess of hills for the fourth time during the peak summer and that too with my HSBC office colleagues was a refreshing experience. Starting on a Friday night in a tempo traveler a/c we left straight from office and had idlis with chutney the all time harmless food brought by one of my colleagues. Around mid night after some time of chit chat everybody fell fast asleep. Around nine in the morning we reached the cottage that was pre-booked. Everybody had to get ready in the typical tour clad and we had to skip the breakfast since the time was noon by the time all the 13 of us got ready. We straight away had lunch. Most of is hired a cycle to come around the lake had spent time clicking photos and enjoying ice creams
It was all photo sessions in guna cave and suicide point. Then came the tea session after which we straight head to pillar rocks. Guys did some shopping raging from clothes, chocolates, oils etc . we reached the room around seven in the evening and around eight we started again for dinner after the guys boozed. Some went to bed late in
IMG_20140531_114733
the night and early out of tiredness. The next morning we vacated the cottage and the auspicious start was from kuronjiandavar temple and later we had bf around eleven. We went trekking to dolphin nose which was cumbersome. Consumed much time than expected that we had to skip the lunch. Around four again guys started shopping and we boarded the cab around five. On the way we visited the silver cascade falls and bought some fruits exotic in kodaikanal. We stopped for Donner on dindigul around nine. The trip got over at six on Monday morning. The experience wa awesome overall.

It was mid of may and local people say that it is agnivarsha nakshtram the hottest days in south. Chennai heat was bleeding us so we decide to go to tada falls for seeking refuge.

Tada falls is something like 100 kilometers on Chennai which is very much accessible by road and train from Chennai. Our wolf pack decided to go by bike as usual all the plans for starting early fell flat.

And we reached the tada Village at 12 P.M. The road is pretty much navigable and there were no traffic issues.

We bought water bottles at the village. This is the last stop where u can get water at reasonable rate.

Since it was hot and the trek was challenging we packed ourselves with sufficient water and snacks.

We reached the forest gate by 12 P.M. We got the tickets which were 25 INR each and for camera we had to again shell out 25INR.Liqour is not permitted inside the park.

We parked our bike at the parking and from there we can see a nice stream of water gushing down.

All the dreariness of the travel was gone the water
DSC_0187
was cool and nice washed my face with the water and dipped my handkerchief in to water and wrapped it around my neck so that it provides me some relief from the scorching sun. This stream is the starting point. After trekking on dirt road for around 2 kilometers we came to another small water body which was like major attraction for lot of people.

There was a big crowd having fun in the small water pool they were jumping into the small pool from rock and tree which I think was not safe though I didn’t see anybody getting hurt. The place was littered with water bottle and plastic and was stinking as well. So instead taking a stop at that place we decided to trot on and soon we hit rocks. Big boulders were all around and trekking on them required some serious rock climbing skills. After trekking for some distance we spotted a pool with aqua blue pristine water there was no garbage around and it was surrounded a lush green tree. It was calm and quiet and we could clearly hear some buzzing sounds created by local insects. Some of us couldn’t help but jumped
DSC_0192
in to the water to cool of as it was 1 and sun was at its full glory. We decided to take a break and had some snacks. Since the climb was steep it was important to have some water and some food to replenish our body with water and calories which was getting burnt at faster rate. The trek was getting tough so we got split into two groups one was moving at faster pace to skirt around and find route to the fall as the trek is not marked. Two of us went ahead and hit a straight rock wall after a steep climb and then came back and noticed a trail going right. Believing our instinct we took that trail and then we had to actually trek down before we heard the divine sound of the water hitting the rocks.

The trek was taxing and both of us felt fatigued. We decided to go under the fall no water was left so we decided to drink water from the fall and filled our water bottles as well. Though this was risky and eventually we had some throat infection although not very serious one.

After waiting
DSC_0196
for some time and seeing that the other group hasn’t reached we got bit worried and went back to find them in a pool. They couldn’t move on as some of them started having the cramp.

On the flora and fauna front the tree as green and shady which I didn’t expect initially as the hills seemed to be barren and we spotted monkey’s which were quite friendly and waiting for leftover food from the trekkers.at 4: pm we started to trek back on the way back found a group where one of the guys had twisted his feet and there was severe bulge. My friend Muthu who is very good leg spinner , software programmer , a great cook turned out to be a doctor as well he used his physiotherapy skills and the guy got some relief from pain hope fully he was able to limp back. Proper trekking shoes and serious rock climbing skills are mandatory for this trek. While heading back to Chennai the transition from serene greenery, gushing streams and the mystic silence of forest to noise, pollution , traffic and lifeless concrete was irritating but alas ! We humans are self-proclaimed brainiest species

Maruthamalai
Dislcaimer: This blog entry does indeed go where the title so eloquently infers. With that said, you can turn away now or skip paragraph 5 while reading. Hope you’re not offended, but hey, it is a part of traveling!

I landed in Mumbai a little after 4 in the morning and watched daybreak from within the tinted airport windows as I awaited my 10 AM departure to Coimbatore where Adina had been interning at a local hospital for the previous three weeks. Adina and her classmate Lisa, who has been on this internship assignment with her, scooped me up in a taxi from the tiny Coimbatore airport and we were immediately on our way for a weekend trip to the Nilgiris mountain town of Ooty. Quickly the bland urban colors and stale dry heat were replaced by lush greenery and cooler mountain air as we ascended to over 2200 meters on narrow switchback roads.

I don’t know if Ooty is not on the foreigners’ radar, but we didn’t notice any other foreigners during our time here. On the other hand, Ooty is most definitely a tourist destination for regional Indian tourists as it was inundated given it was a
Hiking in a tea patch
holiday weekend. The extent of the city, home to about 100,000, we were witness to was a bustling few intersections of crazy traffic and sidewalks of alternating restaurants and stores, selling everything one can imagine from gold jewelry to hygienic products. We dabbled in it all, buying up oils, spices, teas, chocolate and jewelry, but the consistently incredible food was the savoring experience of Ooty (and India as a whole, as we haven’t had a bad meal yet). Every meal, be it breakfast dosas or idly, talis served on banana leaves, or any of the veg dishes we’ve experimented with, has been an incredible sensory experience for the tongue, so rich with spices and flavors our brains are not accustomed to.

Shopping and eating aside, we also had spent some time enjoying the Nilgiris outdoors. Adina and I spent the first morning hiking up a steep hill nearby our hotel. The first half of the hike winded through tea patches and the top portion of the mountain took us through eucalyptus forests, eventually emerging at a cleared plateau with a small shrine and views of the surrounding valleys and mountains. A general haziness, which has been standard throughout our

time in southern India, gave emphasis to the depths of the mountains we stared at, as each more distant peak dramatically lost its green hue. On another of our mornings in Ooty, Adina, Lisa and I set off on what was meant to be a stroll through the neighborhood but turned into much more.

We walked the narrow road on the side of a mountain which winded its way through the “Ooty suburbs” consisting of small houses along the hill side forests and beautiful tea fields. Along the walk, every local along the way shouted and waved hello from wherever they stood. At one point, a young girl and her mother stopped us in our tracks, insisting we come inside for some tea. The rest of the family joined us, several brothers to the young girl, an older sister and her newborn, and the father, all with huge smiles across their faces and our own, as we sat, sipping the tea they had prepared for us, in the tiny bedroom which presumably many, if not all, of them shared. For the next twenty minutes, they showed us old family photos and other prized mementos, and then the gathering shifted
We were rockstars in India... at least in this part of India. Maybe its because there's fewer foreign tourists? We've been getting stopped to take our photos with strangers constantly
to the cricket field across the street, where I dazzled the crowd with my bowling and batting skills. Before we were allowed to continue, my camera was commandeered and the kids and then the father proceeded to take many pictures of us of their own accord. More than an hour after this unexpected pit stop, we were finally on our way, continuing our stroll, but it was an amazing experience to be so courteously and openly welcomed by this family. It was genuine and they seemed so warm and open and curious about us. It was as much fun for them as it was for us.

The other main Ooty activity was a day trip around the Nilgiris culminating with a game drive at a wildlife sanctuary called the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. This day was comical from start to finish. We made a few stops at crowded view points and with each stop we were swarmed by Indian tourists who perhaps were unaccustomed to seeing white people. Families would gather around us to take photos. A baby was even put in Adina’s arms for a picture at one point. This would be the trend throughout Ooty and Coimbatore, whether

With a smile, we temporarily escaped the Indian paparazzi and continued to a nearby lake, one highly recommended by the owner of the bed and breakfast we were staying at near Ooty. The man-made lake which was called Pykara was a huge attraction with the Indian tourists evident by the at-capacity parking and the long lines to take a 10 minute boat ride on the lake. We followed the herd and took a cruise of our own in the tiny rusted piece of metal with a motor attached. As we neared completion of a loop around this reservoir, we laughed to ourselves because the perceivable attraction of the lake eluded us, which thereby provided a novelty for this trip… it was the most random boat ride we’d ever been on. After a quick lunch stop, we were finally at the tiger reserve, the motivation for this day’s trip. Unfortunately however, the main areas of the reserve were closed when we got there, and why we do not know. Without a wealth of options and having spent several hours in the car to get to this point, we decided to hire a
Elephant Camp at the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve
private truck to take us on a game drive to a part of the reserve that was still open. Indeed it sounded like a good alternative. With Adina and Lisa in the back of the truck and myself riding shotgun, it quickly became apparent why this part of the reserve was open, and it was because the drive was along a main road, complete with traffic and small towns along the way for its majority. Surely, the tigers and leopards of the area are attracted to the constantly honking traffic! After quite some time, we at last were in some kind of wilderness, granted there was still a significant amount of through traffic and plenty of honking. About ten seconds into reaching this segment of the tour, the sky opened up with an intense thunderstorm and the angular downpour soaked the three of us as the windowless vehicle and pointless roof upholstering offered little shelter from the rain. No sooner than the rain stopped, than my first and only (knock on wood) bout with your infamous India dysentery arose. Well, shit… literally. For those moments, pooping under a bush in a tiger reserve, I was glad there were only 90
I liked this lamppost in Ooty
tigers populating the 320 square kilometer reserve, and clearly, I survived this death defying #2. With that said, forgive me for taking the blog in this direction, but looking back on our 2 hour game drive, which included 1.5 hours of commute time, getting soaked and seeing two peacocks, this was the story to take away from this day filled with laughter.

After a great weekend in Ooty, we taxied our way three hours to Coimbatore, the industrial city of two million people where Adina and Lisa were interning at the Kovai Medical Care Hospital (KMCH) Occupational Therapy Department. Coimbatore is not a tourist destination which in several ways made it an interesting place to be. Though there was little to see or do, that which we did experience was catered to the locals, and in this way the activities felt like quite local experiences. Since Adina and Lisa had work all week, I was more or less on my own for this stretch, which I mostly spent checking out different markets within various areas of the city and binging on tali lunch buffets. Additionally, I spent a half day visiting a beautiful Hindu temple called Marudamalai, about an
Banana chips!
hour from where we stayed in Coimbatore. Nestled at the top of some foothills of nearby mountains, the temple was an impressively colorful and ornate piece of work in dedication to the Hindu god Murugan. Though the age of the temple is unknown, it is suspected to be at least 1200 years old as it is referenced in inscriptions of other temples of known to be at least such age. As I meandered the temple for an hour, my thoughts were mostly spent admiring the details of the temple and imagining the extent of how the backdrop of Coimbatore below (and India in general) must have evolved over 1200 years.

Well, that wraps up week one in India. Adina and Lisa have now completed their internship and we’re heading further south, towards the coast of Kerala for the final installment of this adventure.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Pondicherry
March 26th 2014
Published: March 26th 2014


I felt like a peaceful island, bare but for a single snow drop bloom on a tuft of grass, floating in the sea. It is my first memory of bliss.

I was at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Pondicherry on a school trip and placed my head on the samadhi of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. I promised to return on my birthday every year. And I did but only 15 years later after many chapters started and ended in my life and I felt about as good as a half written story on a crumpled bit of paper tossed away in frustration.

Where and how do I start with Pondicherry? Trite as it may sound, I fell head over heels in love with this town when I first stepped off a bus as an 8 year old. I came along with my mother, aunt and cousin to visit one of my cousins studying at the University. Namitha and her friend waved at us. They had cycled down to greet us sometime past midnight, I think. I was impressed. That sort of thing never happens in Bangalore.

From that visit, I remember greedily wolfing down raw mangoes smothered
in red chili and salt while hiding in the guest house so I didn’t have to share my loot, sitting in the park throwing a tantrum wondering what all the fuss was while looking at the Governor’s house, watching my mother as she picked up a pink crab on the beach thinking it to be a shell and as she jumped a foot off the ground when it nudged her hand asking to be put back on the sand, the big black rocks right by the road and the sea that didn’t seem deterred by them at all and looked so angry like it wanted to swallow the town whole along with me (this was right after a cyclone and I was sure it had its sights set on me), following the trail of ants with my eyes at my cousin’s hostel, dried flowers the color of dried blood pressed on creamy fragrant candles, voices all grown up and hovering somewhere over my head, circling and crisscrossing like wayward mosquitoes…

*

We must’ve driven through a downpour. There are shops with blue shutters downed, pink and purple houses, and vast stretches of fields – all hazy through the
wet windows. At Pondicherry the sun is shining.

The auto whizzed through narrow lanes and the French quarter. I felt like I was greeting an old friend again. We arrived at L’Escale, a narrow white building on Dumas Street. Julie, an old dog, greeted us. At the lobby, which had an arrangement of bags and other show pieces, we checked into the Mahe de Bourdannais room; it had a pillar and a half. It was in the lane behind the Promenade and we could see the sea from the café at the top, its furthest edges blurred in a mist. The pier stretched a long, lazy arm into the sea.

At 8 in the morning, it was HOT! But that didn’t stop Tee and me from setting off down the Promenade. The sea was a glittering hot blue molten jewel. Clusters of school children crowded the rocks. I spent the morning braving the sun to walk down the Promenade past the memorial, the lighthouse, the residential villas’ high garden walls – bougainvillea escaping it like tendrils of hair from a tightly wound bun, a rickshaw on display, the pink church, the Gandhi statue and the Auro boutique where
they sold candles, incense sticks and stuff made with handmade paper. Then there was the little French library/book shop, the cool courtyard at the Alliance de Francaise, a theater with a rooster over the entrance…We had lunch at Le Café gazing at the sea, tiny specks of boats at the distance and bouys, before heading to the Aurobindo Ashram. I placed my head on the Samadhi with yellow roses laid out on it and while it was peaceful I didn’t experience that intense joy I had felt the first time. But then sacred experiences are sacred because they don’t repeat themselves.

I wanted to visit Auroville and the Matri Mandir on my birthday. Aay found a kindred spirit in the auto driver who took us to Auroville, a good 20 minutes away past a shop selling Hanuman and coconut trees that looked like they had received a tight slap from the recent cyclone and not quite recovered and come back to their upright position. There was also a sleeping devi.

We had to walk down a path that cut through a lot of greenery and ponds to reach the Visitor’s Centre, sidestepping centipedes. The brick buildings were beautiful and a huge chime called Swaram made music. We watched the short film on Auroville and got a viewing pass to the Mandir. The viewing platform is a good km from the center.

The Matri Mandir, which The Mother declared as the soul of Auroville, covered in gold discs rose up from the garden. Once we finished this we had to register our names to visit the Inner Chamber. We returned for a round of shopping at the center’s boutiques and book shop, and for a simple lunch at the cafeteria.

Later, the auto driver took us to Panchavati and a Shani Temple. Panchavati is said to be the only place with a statue of a giant 5-faced Hanuman. The fifth face can be seen from behind the temple through a meshed gap in the wall. The Shani Temple was otherworldly, like it had sprung up in the middle of nowhere. I felt like I had stepped back into another age. We had to go to a rather derelict looking building which had a well at the back with water the color of algae. With our back towards it, we had to throw a one rupee coin into it before heading to the main temple where a giant statue of Shani (Saturn) stood glaring down at us. I cowered under his stern gaze and felt I was trespassing. Outside, there were locals selling sesame seeds/oil wrapped in colorful pieces of cloth. There were trays of these diyas, with each color representing a planet. Further inside, the nine planets are represented in stone and stood in mournful silence. The disquiet within me grew louder as the silence around tried to push into me.

Later that night, we celebrated my birthday with a round of mojitos, a tantrum and tiny perfumed soaps at L’Espace before we headed to Le Club where I blew out the candles off a delicious chocolate mousse cake from Baker’s Street, a French bakery, which Ay had procured during her disappearance earlier in the evening. Topped with red, red wine, the night sped into morning.

*

At the Matri Mandir, the crowd was ferried in vans and we were led by a resident to the gardens surrounding the Mandir. He explained the rules to be followed within the mandir and the architecture – the 12 petals, the size of the discs which are made of 24 carat gold fused in glass, 12 being the number of Shakti. The globe is supported by 4 pillars for each of the four directions, each of which also represents the Divine Mother – Mahakali, Saraswati, Lakshmi and Maheshwari. The Park of Unity is still under progress and a lake is being planned around the Mandir.

Aurovillians stood silently as we walked up and into the Mandir, which was incredibly beautiful and the experience surreal. We had to walk in silence and were signaled to wear socks before proceeding up a winding ramp, sailing in a daze through the soft orange glow. It could be the core of the earth, a space ship or a mother’s womb.

We sat in silent concentration for 15minutes in the Inner Chamber that was all-white with a circle of massive pillars and white cushions around a huge crystal ball. A single ray of the sun entered from the top and pierced into the crystal and its light brushed the floor. The energy was really, really strong. The end was signaled by the blinking of a light and we walked back down the ramp in silence.

We were then led to the lotus pond. The ray of sunlight actually descends down to the smaller crystal placed in the centre of the many petaled lotus pond. We could wander around the garden, sit by the amphitheater or under the shade of the Banyan tree around which Auroville has grown and spiraled out.

Back in Pondicherry, and after an afternoon at Madame Shanthe and a plate of coq au vin, we watched the full moon gather up in the sky, by the sea. I leave knowing I will be back in time to see dawn break over Auroville.

Best of Southern India - week 1

Well firstly let me start off by apologising...its been a while since my last blog....I have be tearing around Kerala and Karnataka and not had wifi in most places!

So, since I last blogged quite a lot has happened...will try to do it justice with a few words and pics!

Thursday 6th.

Up early again and off to Delhi Airport for 6am flight to Kochi. Flight was uneventful, which is always a good thing! Jumped in a taxi and drove to my hotel for a few rest days prior to the start of the 2 week tour in South India.

Spent the rest of the day chilling and watching old films!

Friday 7th & Saturday 8th

Total relaxation days, involving sleeping, reading, watching films and eating curry!

Sunday 9th

Checked out of hotel and headed over to the Fort Area of Kochi to join the Gadventures group tour. Checked into the hotel and decided to treat myself to a massage!! A lovely lady came and collected me and took me to the massage parlour. Decided to indulge in a 40 minute relaxation massage and a
image
30 minute Nasyam treatment which is for clearing sinuses and colds.

Now, it all sounds lovely but let me just say this.....I happen to have had a traditional ayervedic massage in India before which sounded amazing but in real life involved me sitting on a chair whilst an old and somewhat grumpy indian lady poured oil on my head and then proceeded to slap me around! Not relaxing in the slightest! Lol

So this relaxation massage went along the same lines....I was so covered in oil and being pummelled with such gusto that I felt like a steak being tenderised!! What made it funnier was the masseuse constantly asking if I was relaxed!

The sinus treatment was a totally different barrel of laughs! I basically had oil dropped into my sinuses and then my face avidly massaged! Sounds ok I know...but wait...the oil was a special one containing pepper and chilli! After about a minute the oil was making its presence known at the back of my throat! At this point I had the 2 therapists asking if I could now breathe better, I would have liked to have been able to but speaking whilst coughing and
image
dealing with streaming eyes is not easy! Lol

I then was briefly massaged again before being told to hack up all the phlegm in my chest and spit it out in a plastic box! I was to keep doing this for 10 minutes! After which I was free to go supposedly more relaxed and with cleaner sinuses!!

Later that evening the group met up for the first time, we are 9. There is a couple from Canada called Bonny & Ted, Robin and american lady who lives in Tel Aviv, Shiv a guy from New Zealand, 2 college friends from Canada called Indira and Bronty, Pam an american lady and Zoe a girl from Devon.

We went for an orientation walk around Fort Cochin and then had a meal followed by some drinks in a bar!

Monday 10th.

We were up and out by 9am, walked around Fort Cochin visiting Vasco De Gama square, St Francis Church. We then got tuktuks over to the Matancharry area of Kochi and visited the Dutch Palace and Jewish Synagogue before having a lovely drink in a cafe on the waterfront.

We then split up and did our
image
own thing in the afternoon, so Robin and I jumped in a tuktuk and went to a famous restaurant called Dal Roti for some lunch. We had a paneer kati roll and a coke. I then returned to the hotel and had a nap for a few hours before meeting up with the group again to go to a Kathakali show (yes another one!) it was about as bizarre as before! After that we all went out for an evening meal and a few of us went to a bar for some drinks.

Tuesday 11th

Up early Tuesday as we had a train from Kochi to Calcut at 9.10am. The train journey was rather uneventful in comparison to my previous one. We had seats in an air conditioned carriage so I spent the time writing my blog and listening to music. 4 hours later we pulled into Calicut and met a minibus. We then drove to our homestay in Wayanad. We arrived early evening, so freshened up and had something to eat at the homestay. Sathish the guide, myself and a few others sat around playing UNO followed by various different card games until 3am!

Wednesday 12th
image


Up early and took a quick drive through beautiful countryside to the Edakkal Caves, we had to walk up a steep mountain and then climb hundreds of steps to get there! That part wasnt fun, but the views and the caves were spectacular. We then drove to a beautiful village to see the construction of a sustainable community before witnessing a new born calf tottering around.

We then went to a sustainable plantation and tribal village. We trekked through a forest full of banana trees, pepper vines and spices before having a walk through a rice paddy. Easier than it sounds.....our guide had literally just said be careful all the ditches are full of water so walk on the narrow walkway, when I placed my foot on what I thought was solid ground but was actually a really muddy, smelly and wet ditch! Hilarity ensued as I had a sopping wet and squelchy trainer...what made it better was that Santhish the guide did the same thing 30 seconds later!

So me and my squelchy trainer walked the rest of the way to the tribal village and met with Ramen an 87 year old tribal elder who then
image
demonstrated his hunting technique!

After that we returned to the homestay to change and went out for a meal in the village before staying up til 1.30am playing cards again!

Thursday 13th

We left Wayanad and headed to the Mudamalai National Reserve, on route we stopped off at a peaceful and beautiful tea plantation. We arrived at our resort after lunch, we checked in and then sat in the restaurant playing cards until 4pm when we went on our jeep safari. Ted, Bonny, Pam, Robin and I jumped in our rickety old jeep and headed off into the park. We spent hours spotting spotted deer, samba deer, peacocks, warthogs, buffalo and elephants. once dark we headed off in search of elephants and big cats. The drivers were tearing around in pitch black with no headlights on giving each other tips as to what has been seen and where! We found a herd of elephants, so the drivers were manoeuvring round to shine headlights on them. All of a sudden an angry elephant came charging out of the bushes and chased us down the road! Bonny and Robin were screaming, the driver just sat there not moving and
image
being at the back of the jeep meant I was watching the whites of the elephants eyes getting nearer!

In the end we left the elephants in peace and found a leopard. Again the driver manoeuvred the jeep so we could shine the headlights on the leopard. This was all very well but meant we reversed into a bush and I had to watch the back of the jeep incase an elephant, tiger or leopard stalked us from behind! Lol

We returned to the resort unscathed and had dinner before disco-ing the night away. Once most of the group had gone to bed myself, Sathish, Zoe and Shiv all sat round a bonfire until 2am. At which point a dog started barking next door (which means there is a wild animal outside) and there was a rustle in the bushes, so Santhish went to Investigate but found only a domestic cat! Lucky! Last month an elephant broke in and broke the pool!

Friday 14th

We left the resort and drove through the Mudamalai park to Mysore. We arrived in Mysore at lunchtime, had a quick freshen up and then went out to see the Mysore Palace,
image
it is a beautiful place unfortunately I cannot show any photos of the inside as no photos allowed but got a few from outside. We then went to a temple dedicated to Durga before climbing up to see one of the largest bull statues in the world.

In the evening it was the standard affair of dinner and then cards in Sathish's room with obviously Sathish, Zoe, Robin, Shiv and myself.

Saturday 15th

We popped for a quick walk around the largest market in asia which sells flowers, fruits and vegetables (oh and also powder paint for Holi). Then we had some free time before having to catch train to Chennai. Sathish and I went for brunch and then a walk round the shops with Shiv whilst he bought loads of pashminas, scarves and saris for his family.

1.30pm we jumped in tuktuks and whizzed down to the station for the 2.16pm train to Chennai. 7 hours!!! Yawn!

Got good seats in an air conditioned carriage with a table so most of us proceeded to play UNO followed by cards and then 'who am I?' The indians on the carriage were highly entertained by our
image
antics and a few joined in with the cards.

Had plenty of food and drink provided on the train by 'meals on wheels', no relation to ours.....

We arrived at Chennai train station at 9.30pm and then had a 90 min journey to the hotel.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Auroville
February 13th 2014
Published: February 13th 2014


Some of the first trees planted
Time's flown by, and I can't believe it's already the middle of my third week here! I've been having an amazing time and every day holds something new and different, from work tasks to workshops to food to meeting new people and everything in between.



Last Wednesday morning I did “tree hole digging” for my first morning SEVA, which involved one person loosening soil in an uphill arc around a metal tube placed on the ground, which is approx. 30cm diameter and 70cm high, using a pointy metal crowbar, whilst the other person digs out the soil from the arc using a “mounti”(?) spade, which is a shovel with a short handle (photo hopefully included) and deposits it around the tube, making a mound around 40cm high. These tubes then get filled with trees and compost, which I described before.



Bees and termites were a highlight again...as we'd run out of black putty to fill bee holes, we turned to termites, and to making an anti-termite pesticide. This consists of a juice made from partly fermented neem leaves. To collect the neem leaves, neem trees must be climbed and I spent a wonderful two hours
In the forest
high in the trees, removing their leaves.



Thursday morning I was on breakfast cooking and went on coconut duty – we had to break and grate 20 coconuts in total, using hand graters with turning handles. It was quite therapeutic and I got to meet a couple of guys I'd not spoken to much before. I had a yummy vegan pizza on “night out”, a marinara with mushrooms. Friday was cleaning day, which involved clearing round the huts and fixing a toilet door using coconut rope.



I went away for the weekend to a town around 6 hours away called Trichy (Tiruchirappalli), where we visited the Rockfort temple, a temple built on top of a rock 273ft high - the view from the temple over the flat city was amazing! We also went to the Ranganathaswamy temple complex, the 5th largest temple complex in Tamil Nadu. We couldn't see much of the temple complex as we weren't hindu, but it was still impressive. That evening we had the best food I've tasted so far in India, from a small Indian “restaurant” by the bus station – perfect idly (compacted mushed up rice in a
Trees planted in mounds
disc shape) and chapatis, with the tastiest curries...all served on a banana leaf by a very charming old man. The bill came to 65Rupees (less than 65p) between us! The least we could do was leave the change from 100R.



We caught the train to Villapurum on Sunday instead of the bus, which was a good decision as it was much roomier and more pleasant. I spent the journey on a metal luggage rack above some of the seats – a great way to travel! We arrived back at Sadhana in time to cook dinner.



Last week I didn't have a weekly Seva. Monday I collected leaves in the morning for new trees that were planted, and then after breakfast, helped dig a hole for compost with two Norwegian guys, which was hot sweaty work in the heat, but definitely rewarding. We continued the same job the next morning and managed to make a hole about 2m square and 50cm deep – it needed to be a metre deep. I had the job of submitting volunteer data (C forms) to the government online, for 3 sevas last week, which was a boring job, but
Big banyan tree
gave me a nice opportunity to get to know some of the long-term volunteers. Other things I did were tree care and breakfast cooking.



I went to a couple of really amazing workshops last week. To start with, every Monday evening we have a sharing circle and last week it was very busy. It's a quiet space where each person in the circle has an opportunity to share how they are feeling or issues on their mind. Most people share very positive experiences and ways in which living at Sadhana has changed their lives – I was surprised at the number of people who have benefitted hugely and have gained things they never expected to gain, when all they came for was to help plant a forest. For me, I feel the most important things I've gained here so far are the incredible friendship and support I've found from many people, and inspiration and ideas from the extra workshops and conversations I've had, which have given me tools I can take home with me. It's really an invaluable experience.



So, that was the first workshop. The second was a talk about “Gift Economy”, run
Compassionate Social Change workshop
by a guy called Shami, who is an NVC (Non-Violent Communication) trainer. NVC is something I've only learnt about since being here – up til now, it's always meant “National Vegetation Classification”! But it's a really interesting training in coping with social issues, understanding other people and communicating in a positive way. The gift economy talk was about ways of making exchanges, whether personal or business, using a gift system, i.e. allowing people to decide how much to pay and looking at alternative ways of paying that move away from money. It's a very different and in my opinion much fairer way of working, than the conventional methods of exchange, and has given me some ideas that I could apply to my own situation.



Another workshop I attended was intuitive massage on Friday, which involved first meditating to feel our hands and body, and then massaging a partner in whatever way you feel they need. It didn't even have to be massage, it could be a hug, or placing your hand on their body – you just went with your intuition. I felt amazing afterwards and my partner said she did as well, and gave me the
Practicing acrobalance
biggest hug and thank you afterwards. It's really powerful, not just for healing muscles, but to help emotional healing as well. It's inspired me to start up my own group when I come home.



I also went to a workshop over the weekend, looking at “Compassionate Social Change”. This looked at ways in which it's possible to resolve conflict through understanding another person's position and realising that everybody does what they do for a good reason, whether consciously or subconsciously, because everybody has what Shami called a “beautiful dream”. We looked at situations in our own lives and did role-play to find ways of expressing ourselves and resolving the situation, whilst conveying understanding of the other person's position. It was interesting to feel how the same message could come across so differently, some ways making you feel tense and angry, others making you feel understood and happy to help the other person. We also did a little on ways to express our needs and dreams to people who don't share them with us, but I didn't manage to finish the course as I had to help cook dinner.



Other things that happened last week
One of the three owls that live in a stump outside my dorm
– I had my first (and 2nd, 3rd and 4th) vegan brownie, tried ladu (vegan sweets – balls of crushed almond and dried fruits), danced at “ecstatic dance”, a rave with no alcohol, ate out at the same indian restaurant 3 days in a row and was surprised to eat new curries every day, led a 45 minute yoga class, went to the mud pool most days, met lots of new wonderful people and sadly said goodbye to a few as well.



This week my weekly second Seva is toilet cleaning – I'm interested in learning more about how they maintain the compost loos. Each day after breakfast I clean 6 toilets, which is easy work, but then sometimes have to lift buckets of poo + compost out if they're getting full and transport them to the composting area, which is heavy work, but rewarding, like most things here. My other sevas have all been repeats of things I've done before, so I won't bore you with the details.



On Monday my friend Ashley ran a belly-dancing workshop which I attended, and completely loved it! I also attended Osha meditation in the meditation yurt,
One of the toilets
in a group of around 20 people. Osha is an interesting type of meditation session where, for the first half an hour, everybody talks jibberish – i.e. noises that don't make sense in your own language. After a minute of awkwardness, we all got in to it and let ourselves go – some people screamed sometimes, some made loud fast noises, others were calmer. I felt I was able to “talk” through some of the issues in my life and after time, my jibberish became calmer as I was able to think of the good things in my life. The second half an hour, we meditated in silence. Yesterday, I went for a bit of a shopping trip to Kulapalayam – I've rented my own moped, which is fantastic – so bought some jewellery, trousers and bits and pieces from some very lovely Indian men, one of which has invited me and some friends to have dinner with his family next week.



I think that's it for now. I'm a little poorly at the moment – a cough/flu has been going round the camp and I was coughing a lot last night – but I'm starting to feel better and should be back to normal by tomorrow.



I hope you're all well back home.

Lots of love,



Clare

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Ooty
January 29th 2014
Published: January 30th 2014


lovely colonial style bookshop at the train station in Ooty
they had some pretty amazing english speaking books which we bought
It is a long time ago I (Nina) was reading a book about an english lady who lived in the Nilgiris when the english settled into India. I do not remember the title of the book (it was actually not the best book I have ever read), but what I do remember is the beauty of the landscape that was described. Somehow I had the idea of going to Ooty despite a lot of people telling us, that it is a really dull place.

From Mysore we took a private bus to Ooty. And I have to admit, never again a private bus in India! This SPN Travel & Tours tried to rip us off whenever they could. Well, they were not successful in the end, but it was a lot of hassle to make it clear that we will not pay more than the regular fare. They kept asking for the money for the National Parks and stuff like this all the time - but hey, in the end, we did not stop and just drove through the National Parks. And by the way, we had only asked for a bus to Ooty, not for sightseeing. They were quite
on the toy train from Ooty to Mettupalayam
what a fun journey
angry with us in the end, but we simply did not pay. The drive itself from Mysore to Ooty took about 5 hours and it was stunning. We drove through the National Parks and up many, many hairspins with amazing views over the Nilgiri Mountains. That was the good part of taking a private bus, as they took the side road to Ooty and not the main road. We passed small colourful villages and a lot of tea plantations. At least that was worth the hassle with the bus driver and the guide.

Finally, we reached Ooty in the early afternoon. We had decided to stay in town knowing that accomodation is better outside in the hills. But as we were staying just for 1 night to get the train the next day, it was easier to stay in a place close to the train station. We choose the Mount View Hotel which was ok. Well, the bedsheets were clumsy and had the usual dirt, but at least they had a hot shower in the evening (and only in the evening) and WIFI. Well, and then we started walking around town. What a dull place. We were just wondering
lovely village in the Nilgiris
why a lot of locals really love this town as their holiday destination. This town has a colonial feel, but nothing since then has ever been renovated. I think even the grounds of the horserace are the same. It looks more like a farming field than a racecourse. To all the colonial touch you have the indian mess and garbage combined with some wonderful smells. It is a crazy, surrealistic mixture which was interesting - but not for more than one day. We continued our walk around town till we finally ended up in a restaurant highly recommended by lonely planet. Well, never trust a lonely planet... ;-). It was a chinese restaurant with an indian touch. Well, the food was save and ok. But the atmosphere was - well, let's say: very interesting. A lot of local families were eating there. The chinese dishes had an indian twist and the dirt you can find in both countries was combined in this restaurant. On the ceiling there were huge fans all black of all the oil hanging in the air. Afterwards we were off for a nice cool beer and finally found one in a dark hotel bar. It was
the toy train arriving in Ooty
a strange feeling being the only lady in the bar but the barkeeper was happy to see us and the guests left us in peace. At least, we could enjoy peacefully a nice cold Kingfisher.

After a freezing night (well, it gets below 0 degrees centigrade in Ooty in winter) and a clumsy bed at least we had a wonderful breakfast at the Garden's Restaurant with some nice Masala Dosas, fresh juices and a chai. Afterwards we made our way to the train station. The day before, the station master had put us on the waiting list as the train had already been sold out. So we wanted to make sure we could get the train by being the first ones in line for the waiting list. For 3 hours we had to wait - well, we were very happy about the little bookshop in the train station where we bought some wonderful books. We made it and finally got squeezed into the general coach. At least we were sitting at the windows, so nothing to complain about. The ride down to Mettupalayam took about 3 hours with some stops in small villages. The scenery was stunning and changed

imagine you slip.....
from rivers, tea plantations, forests to farming fields. The Nilgiris are, despite Ooty, really beautiful and it would have been worth hanging around in one of the villages. But time was running short and we had some more destinations planned. Overall, we can highly recommend the toy train ride. It is not something totally out of this world, but it is a peaceful and pleasant way to experience the landscape.

Once we reached Mettupalayam it was a 10 minutes walk to the bus station where we immediately got a local bus to Coimbatore where we wanted to stay for the night. It was another hour and a short Rikhsaw ride later and we found a very pleasant hotel in one of the sideroads near the junction. The AP Hotel was recently renovated, cheap and extremely clean. We also found a great restaurant (this and that and go - something like this it was called) and had an amazing dinner. Coimbatore has quite a bad reputation as the Manchester of India. But we found it to be a very pleasant, organized and clean town. We were really sad to live very early the next morning. It surely is a wonderful
on the bus from Mysore to Ooty
place off the beaten track with excellent shopping opportunities. After a short night we got up very early to reach our train at 4 am. Thankfully, it was a 3rd class sleeper train. So we were able to continue the night. It was quite comfortable and we had a pleasant journey to Kollam. There, we had to wait for 2 hours to catch another local train to our final destination: Varkala. Well, and this local train was exactly the same that you can find when you google ""india train ride"". It was packed with people hanging out of the doors, sitting in the luggage department and everywhere else possible. But somehow we made it with our backpacks. Well, we stood close by the door but the people were very polite and made room for us. Like this, we did not have to lean out of the door holding our backpack. Unfortunately, we had no free hand to take pictures. But it was a great adventure which, thankfully, lasted just 30 minutes (Kollam is very close to Varkala).

After some action packed days it was time for some beach hours... More about this in our next blog.

January 28th 2014
Published: January 28th 2014


Himalayas from the plane
I'm staying at Sadhana Forest in Auroville, Tamil Nadu, India for 4 weeks as a volunteer. Sadhana is a reforestation project that is aiming to replant 70 hectares of Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest, a highly diverse forest with around 160 woody species, of which only 0.01% of the original remains. Much of the land that was originally covered with this forest has turned to desert and the water levels have dropped so much that people find it hard to reach fresh water and many streams and rivers have dried up.



A local tree nursery provides young trees for the project and thousands of volunteers come to work at the project every year – there are currently just over 100 people staying, but people arrive and/or leave most days. Around 1/3 of the residents are long-term volunteers and some have been here for several years.



The project has been running since 2003 and there are now many different buildings around the site – a main community building where we eat and socialise, a covered kitchen, a meditation/yoga yurt, a library/classes building, 3 large dormitories and around 10 smaller family/couples huts, plus tool shed etc.. They're all
Aeroplane birthday!!
made from wood with reed roofs – really beautiful! There are also A LOT of toilets and showers, some outdoor, some covered, all separated drop toilets and bucket showers – simple, but they're all we need. There are also two big mud pools, which contain lovely clay mud, incredible when used as a face or hair mask! The water gets quite warm in the afternoons but it's refreshing to get in on a hot day – it's a surprisingly good way to get clean!



My journey here was more interesting than most – I left Heathrow on January 22nd 2014 and turned 25 on the plane. I was sat beside the sweetest couple, who put up a Happy Birthday message for me to wake up to on the screen in front of me! When I arrived in Chennai my friend Sara who lives there met me at the airport and drove me through the busy city to her favourite cafe, where we got dinner and shared a chocolate mousse - a nice alternative birthday cake! She put me on a bus afterwards to Pondicherry, thank goodness – Chennai was crazy and I would have found it hard
Sadhana forest path
to navigate around on my own. The bus was a bit squashed but nobody had to stand for too long and it didn't take too long to get used to the beeping and constant overtaking that's to be expected in this part of the world, and everyone was very nice to me, though some stared a bit. I made it to my hostel around 11pm Indian time, completely exhausted from travelling for the past 24 hours! It was such a nice place – Aadhaar guesthouse – where I met a lovely girl at breakfast who gave me advice on travelling in India.



I caught an auto-rickshaw from Pondicherry to Sadhana Forest on the Friday, probably paying over the odds but just glad to arrive safely. I was met by one of the long-termers who showed me around and I met Thiery, who had also just arrived. After lunch we were shown round and taken to our 1st floor dorm room, which houses about 16 people, each with a thin mattress, sheet, pillow and mosquito net. It's very comfortable and we have about a metre between beds, so it doesn't feel at all cramped. Friday is Tour Day,
Big black and yellow beetle
so around 100 extra people arrived at 4.30 and after an explanation of the values and aims of the project, we were all taken to look at the main forest and mud pool. I was surprised that most of the trees are non-natives: eucalyptus and acacia - I had expected most of the area to have already been planted, but it's a slow process and tree planting only began 5 years ago. Trees are only able to grow at all thanks to the huge amount of work on water conservation, which has raised the water levels several metres to their natural levels. Although the eucalyptus and acacia will be removed in the long-term, they currently contribute to the forest, by stabilising the soil, dropping leaf litter and providing shade.



Before dinner, we all sat in the community building to watch a film, “Life in A Day”, which depicted videos taken by people all over the world on a certain day in June 2013 – an interesting watch. It was nice to see something like that with such a large and diverse group of people.



We don't work too much on weekends, except for essential
The prettiest baby tree
cooking and cleaning jobs, so I was able to spend those two days how I liked! On Saturday I cycled with Thiery to Kuilapalayam, one of the nearby villages, where I ate a tasty massala dosa for lunch. We went down to the seaside and paddled in the sea – three large white women turned up and stripped down to bikinis, met with an incredible surge of Indian men into our section of the beach! The women didn't seem to notice the attention and carried on swimming! My bike got a puncture at the beach and there was nowhere nearby to get it fixed, so we had to walk several kilometres back up to the village with our bikes – by the time my bike was fixed, it was past 4.30pm so we had to cut our trip short to cycle back for dinner. In the evening a big group of us went to an Indian Soufi music event...I was falling asleep for a lot of it – meditative music is not easy to stay awake during when you're tired!



I went to a really inspirational day-course on Sunday called “Peas vs. Pills” all about healthy eating,
Mud pool
at the Sanctuary for Health And Reconnection to Animals and Nature (SHARAN). The woman who took the course was a trained doctor and nutritionist and was incredibly interesting and knowledgeable about a wide range of health impacts and benefits of different foods, as well as environmental and ethical aspects. It was a great start to my month as a vegan and showed how with a little imagination and effort, it can be simple to eat well and can make you feel amazing!



Monday was my first proper day of work. We work two SEVAs (selfless giving sessions) a day, the first before breakfast from 6.30am to 8.30am, and the second from 9.45am to 12.30pm – we work early in the day to avoid too much of the heat – it's 27OC every day. We get woken up every morning by one of the volunteers singing and/or playing music and then have “morning circle”, where we stretch and hug each other good morning. My first session was “tree planting” and I planted 6 trees, so was really pleased! We plant trees in mounds we dig and surround them with humanure (2-year old human manure from the compost toilets)
My dormitory
and mulch them with a thick layer of leaves. There are about 15 species to plant at the moment. My second SEVA was lunch cooking and I learnt to break and grate coconuts – 3 of us did 15 coconuts between us, it took a good hour!



On Tuesday morning my job was “tree care”, so I helped collect leaves and spread them on top of mounds, to protect the roots from the strong sun in summer. All week, my second SEVA is “bees and termites”. This involves climbing around the buildings looking for holes in the wooden branches that hold up the building, made by bees, and filling them with putty. It's a great job if you like climbing! Only problem is that it's almost impossible to get all the putty off your hands, so it means I've got a week of black hands ahead. I'll put up a photo of us climbing in my next blog, I forgot to take one today.



Hope you're all well!



Lots of love, Clare x

Holy man outside the temple
selling things for offerings
We went to the Kapaleeshwarar temple for sunset. Legend tells a story that in a fit of pique Shiva once turned his consort Parvati into a peacock and instructed her to worship him here in order to regain her normal form. Parvati supposedly did as instructed at a spot just outside the northeastern corner of the temples central block where a shrine commemorates the event.Terry is wearing a special shield for his ankle so it’s not easy for him to take his shoes off so I went inside by myself. Deities surround the temple and some areas are more holy than others. Temples within temples and queues of people lined up to be blessed by the priest inside these inner temples– for this they pay extra maybe 20 or 50 rupees depending I suppose on the holiness of the area. I love the flashing disco lights that abound amongst the ancient carvings. People sitting around eating blessed food, others prostrating themselves before their God but unfortunately or perhaps fortunately you cannot take pictures inside. Once, out of the temple we stopped at a self help soup cart and was encouraged to try banana stem soup which I am so glad I

did by an elderly man who said he was a retired banker. Whilst drinking our soup a procession came up the road to the temple - effigies were carried under umbrellas accompanied by a band and many priests. We meandered our way through the streets which were packed with fruit and vegetable sellers. As it was dark already it seemed late for people to be out and about buying vegetables but as I found out the next day later working hours obviously necessitate that. Eventually we arrived at the beach which was not in the direction we thought we were going at all but it was lovely and with a warm breeze blowing so very comfortable. Even at this latish hour about 9 o clock the beachfront was busy. I totally understand that living conditions are cramped for most people and so to be out and about is freedom, space and also away from prying eyes.

The following day I was taken for lunch by Mr Singh who is a business associate of my sister and her husband. I had heard for many years about this famous pomegranate and lime drink they had experienced in India and had been

Priests, musicians and people throng around this procession
looking for it on my journey only to find out that it is a specialty of the Annalaksmi the restaurant I was being taken to. Sometimes restaurants are in the oddest places and this one was no exception on the first floor of what looked like a regular business block. Once the doors were opened and we were ushered into a beautiful restaurant that really transported one to somewhere else. Rich colours greeted us,there were carved wooden pictures on the walls, water features with marigolds – they are so symbolic of prayer to me in Asia I just love their absolute cheerfulness. Outside every temple you are sure to find them waiting to be given as offerings to the Gods. But here inside I was to find the elusive pomegranate and lime juice pure no added sugar! It was a set menu starting off with tasty snacks and soup leading up to a thali with about 8 different dishes to eat with chapatti, roti, nan and rice. The dishes consisted of palak (spinach) paneer with pinapple (curd cheese) a carrot salad, dhal (lentils) gobi (potatoes) and raita (yoghurt) every dish more delicious than the next. I loved that there was

water cart
even pomegranate with the carrot salad. A digestive drink along the way was made from hot water, tomatoes, chilli and coriander with a mixture of spices. To end there was a choice of ice cream and I had mango along with a pudding I have forgot its name but not its taste – it was a rice pudding but more liquid with bits of gelatinous rice pieces very yummy.

After lunch I went to the factory where I met all the workers – they were making and packaging shirts. The first thing that struck me was that the room was airy and light, the conditions looked good and all the staff seemed happy. This in contrast to what we hear about sweatshops which I am sure there are a multitude down alleyways in some bazaar areas. They were busy packaging an order and checking that there were no pins or needles (which sometimes break off during stitching) left behind as if there are they face huge penalties. Each garment is carefully screened. We were then off to the retail outlet which was for me a treasure trove of Indian apparel – Sari’s of every colour which, I believe an

I did take lots of pictures in the hopes that maybe one day I could order some things. In fact I was graciously given a gift to take back to my sister and that is too bulky even though I implored I could not carry it there are just times when you have to take what is offered otherwise it is an impolite offence!

havnt a clue
what these are have never seen them before so if any one knows please let me know
We got dropped off at the train station and our journey began. Finding out which platform to be on is only made available a few minutes before the train leaves and then it’s a mad scramble to the correct one. In this case it was more or less going to be platform 4 and then where will your coach be? Trains are very long with many different classes – we had booked 2nd class a/c . there is first class locking doors and comes with 2 or 4 berths, 2nd class a/c 2 tier and 3 tier – with curtains to give you some privacy, 3rd class same deal but no curtains, seats for express trains in two different categories and then unreserved 2ndclass with wooden or plastic seats crowded with a gazillion people but very cheap. We got some advice where to stand which was wrong and so ended up on the wrong end of the platform and then got some great help and we had a mad scramble back up the platform through the crowds to the other end of the platform. With all the chaos there is also incredible management. There are electronic signs nowadays at various intervals
samoosas
we did not eat these ones but have had a few along the route and they have all been delicious
which tell you the trains number that is arriving as it comes and others that point out where your carriage will stop and it does! Then you make your way down the narrow aisle over bags and shoes. Some people have already been on this train for a night and a day looking a bit disheveled -to your berth. We had an upper and lower berth which we shared with 2 other gentlemen. One turned out to work for the railways and was on his way to some place that meant he would have to get off the train at 4am and the other was pediatric anesthetist who was going to a conference and getting off one stop before us. New clean linen arrived for us and the old ones taken away, its amazing how efficient it all is and how it works. We had a great sleep till the first guy got up to leave and switched all the bright lights on!!!! When morning comes around it starts to get busy up and down the aisles with waiters selling an array of goodies and calling out what their provisions are chai, coffee, water and cool drinks, snacks and then
mirrors and things
breakfast, I ordered a egg sandwich which was an omelet with chilli in between two slices of soggy toast very civilised. Vijawarda station was clean and our hotel was just around the corner. This town turned out to be a great surprise and as we walked around through the markets we marveled at the cleanliness of it. Once again we saw some amazing shops and carts selling all sorts of goods. I really liked one that was so colourful with mirrors and combs and all sorts of useful stuff. We had a delicious samoosa along the way with many cups of chai which we love too. We saw a guy putting new treads on tyres by hand – looked like he was doing a lino cut (I suppose the idea is similar) We jumped on a rickshaw and went and visited a cave temple outside of town, It was lovely the view was great and the scenery before us was very pleasant with many hills, rivers and canals running through the area. In a way I wished we had more time for this town but in fact we had a 6.30 train to catch.

We got there in time
sweet little girl
sitting with her grandparents outside their shop
surprise, surprise only to find out the train was delayed a bit and then a bit longer and then even a bit longer than that all in all 4 hours later it arrived and oh we could have slept a bit longer in our nice room and had breakfast at the hotel! We did manage to watch life for those hours and its fascinating. Indians just throw everything out – on the floor if they can they just don’t seem to care. I remember from my previous visit 26 years ago that most things were wrapped in banana leaves ,string and paper. What got chucked out the cows came past and ate, Plastic bags were on their way in and I thought oh no why? Sometimes the old ways are better!! Now there are rivers of plastic, foil containers from all the food being sold and it feels like India is being buried alive under all this garbage. Firstly they need to charge people for plastic bags. I am so proud of South
Africa that has done that and its been a long time now and we can really see the difference that has made to our landscape and
the full picture
I am sure it could do the same for here. But this station was incredibly clean – as soon as a train had departed railway staff were on the tracks picking up what they could recycle and then hosing down the tracks as even though on the train it says don’t use the toilets when at a station many people simply don’t care. We also got lucky as we were in 3 a/c but we got the bunks against the aisle window and there are only 2 so you can sit up straight. If you don’t know the person above you and they want to lie down then there is not much space to sit up properly in this class with 3 tiers. Time flew past I chucked out a few zzzzz’s ordered lunch - all so orderly. It was 11 am and was told lunch would be at about1 and it came as ordered. Nowadays everyone has their cell phones and laptops playing movies and music videos chatting to contacts at every opportunity.

Its always a full train cause as soon as a person gets off at a station the place is filled by a newcomer. Trains run
re treading tyres
very full here, did I tell you how mind boggling it is to actually find the train you need from all the choices you have – fast trains, express trains some stopping lots and some hardly at all. It’s a minefield. With the time we had waiting for this train I went and got info for the next trains we were planning on taking and that would prove to be a big help.
We arrived latish in the afternoon to normal chaos which I cant find the words to describe- people everywhere feels like millions of them, things, Post, trunks of every size all waiting to be loaded or having just been unloaded. The Indians are a very patient bunch and they wait very patiently on the platforms in the waiting halls sitting on the floor in family groups often sharing some food – its almost like they have come here for a picnic. We had decided to book our onward tickets as soon as we arrived so we could get them out the way but as luck would have it the delay meant we missed the reservation office for foreign tourists as it closes early on a Sunday.
Dhurga rock temple
We got a pre-paid rickshaw to our hotel the Ramada on Egmore and it turned out to be a great big room views not incredible more like we can see a glimpse of the city. But it is such nice room with all the fruit we are happy. Outside around the corner it’s a bit of a shabby area and on our exploration for a restaurant we found there are many people living their lives out on the street. I am used to street people in Cape Town but here there are many whole families and they are making open fires to cook their meals in the street, sitting in groups playing games chatting sleeping on perhaps a piece of cardboard in a rickshaw or cart. Openly, casually it’s all very normal.

In the morning we made our way back to train station to sort out onward tickets. There is a foreign desk there and the agent was so friendly – once again I can’t believe how many trains they have to look through millions of people are travelling all the time sorry to go on about it but it does boggle the mind. Once we had the tickets
Ganesh
sorted it was booking places to stay. Its so busy here as its high season so you cant just rock up like in the past and hope a place has a vacancy for you. To be continued……

Cribbage on the way to Madurai
Most of this day was spent getting to Madurai. We left the Pondy hotel at about 0700 and went straight to one of the other french bakeries for breakfast. Nice coffee and muffins or french toast. Not excessive in semi-rural India. French bread sticks for lunch.

A few hours later we were at the Villupuram Junction waiting for a train. There was going to be a bit of a wait so I walked the platform photographing trains and people and the interactions between them. We were excited to come across several teams who were vaccinating children against polio - part of the campaign that has achieved a polio-free status for this populous country. They seemed to stop every family with a small child, give them some information, give the child a few drops of oral vaccine, mark the child's little finger and they are on their way. At least in these largely literate southern states that is all that is needed. We understand that elsewhere like Pakistan for example, tribal leaders see the polio vaccination program as a US conspiracy and point to sudden infant deaths as evidence of the dangers of vaccination. The teams we spoke with were justifiably
Madurai temple west gate
proud of their achievements.

As we have noted before our guide DJ says he is always stressed out when taking a group through an Indian railway station. He was pretty good on this day, it being daylight, and the platforms wide and clean. We were nonetheless keyed up for the arrival and all got on in record time. Very much like the last sleeper train and clearly many people were on-board from earlier overnight travel. We cleared out our room and six of us again shared one compartment. It was a long trip, maybe 5 hours, but there were two bunks for sleeping, some books to read, some blogs to update and Catherine got a taste of Cribbage from our Canadian travel buddies. Not much to see though we did travel through lush landscapes. Getting off was more of a hassle than getting on the train because there were plenty of people trying to force their way onto the carriage, ignoring the obvious fact that we are keen to get off and vacate their seats. With full backpacks, it was a little challenging. We walked the couple of hundred metres to the hotel. Madurai had more of the look
Madurai temple detailed reliefs
and feel of New Delhi. Quick turn-around and out to see the famous temple complex.

This was truly one of the most spectacular religious monuments we have seen - anywhere. The complex itself is bounded on four sides by massive entry gates. These are gently curved walls incorporating thousands of brightly coloured statues of Hindu dieties and mortals going about their lives. Inside was a complex maze of sub-temples and museums. Thousands of people moving through the complex and finding spots for focussed worship. This temple had many themes of femaie life including a Neme tree to worship for the achievement of pregnancy, and nooks in which to seek a smooth labour. The temple is dedicated to Pavarti, Shiva's wife. Elephants were part of the ceremony at several spots. At one, the elephant would take your 10 Rupee note and give your head a brush with his trunk - apparently a blessing. It was a bit surprising that little stores were allowed to operate within the temple complex. Thankfully the touts were not aggressive. I paid a guy 10 Rupees to show me how the stone work could be struck to produce a tune. The complex covers acres and also incorporates a lake where they host a boat festival when the monsoons are kind. We spent several hours following the guide around but unfortunately we were not allowed to use our cameras. Must have something to do with flashes and decaying vegetable dyes because mobile phone cameras were OK.

Dinner was on the roof top of the hotel overlooking the Madurai temple complex. Some of the group returned to the complex before we headed off again, which in retrospect we should have done too.

Taking in the views at Dodabetta Peak
We wandered about the city and did a bit of shopping. We are all a bit wary of the food now and sad to say it has not been of a good standard the last couple of days. Following a very light lunch we headed to the station to farewell Maddy. We had to buy tickets to go onto the platform to say goodbye and spent some minutes approaching people to see if they spoke English- just to check we were at the right place. Turns out we were. When the old train rolled in we were in the right place and Maddy boarded - Grant, Lois, Peter and Roy all checked out the train ( they got on to inspect the carriage to make sure they thought it was safe). We have loved having Maddy with us and will miss her. She popped her head out to say she was sitting next to a lovely Indian girl who was getting off at the same stop so we all breathed a sigh of relief. Then it was off for a long drive up to Ooty. Once again we wound our way carefully up into the mountains, through gorgeous bush very reminiscent
View of Ooty
of NZ except for the cute monkeys at many lay-bys and the breathtaking driving manoeuvres; hairpin curves with not enough room for two vehicles let alone the buses that gestured to our driver to move over when we were balancing very close the edge, tuktuks and motorbikes that tried to slide in between our van and said buses not the mention the odd pedestrian. And then the fog came down!!!!!!!! We cheered when we arrived at our hotel which is near the lake and very nice. In the morning we set off for a bit of sightseeing, firstly heading up to the Dodabetta Peak, which at an altitude of 2623 metres is the highest point in Southern India. Once again we were the attraction. The view was spectacular though the haze made photography difficult. The terraced mountainside is very like those in Cinqe Terre in Italy though we think it could be portuguese influences as well. On our way back down we visited a tea factory which was really interesting. Ooty is a very popular tourist destination and is a very pretty city. It has a really nice 'vibe', people are happy enjoying the sites as we are. We visited
Stained glass window in gorgeous old Anglican Church - St Stephens
the Ooty Botanical Gardens which were set up in 1847 and had a very relaxed wander. We came across a part of the place named -The Italian Garden - according to a sign there, the British bought Italian prisoners of war into India to design the garden. So there is another piece of evidence for our Italian influence theory. We opted not to do the three hour train trip and instead went to lunch at the Savoy- we were keen for quality food. The Danish pastries and croissants went down a treat with a fine cup of Earl Grey tea. Antony, our driver, dropped us off at the lake for a bit of paddle boat fun and a great walk. Dinner at the Savoy!

Descent of the Ganges monolith
Actually it wasn’t a bad night. The carriages are air-conditioned – evaporative systems one of the germans later explained, and pretty sound-proof, so little clackety clack. The biggest problem was the jerking starts and stops. Let’s not mention the washrooms. By the time we got ourselves awake, lightly fed and packed we had arrived at Chennai station. This is the end of the line so DJ was not so concerned.

Catherine and I shouldered our backpacks and followed the group out to the carpark and to the next minibus. Chennai station had more of the hallmarks of Indian stations as we have seen them elsewhere in the country. Dirty and smelly, with plenty of street people milling around to beg or whatever. Chennai is a major military post and so beggars and dozens of fit young soldiers mixed. A tall, ornately dressed transsexual begged at the windows of our bus. We quickly moved out of Chennai and headed south. The streets were wide and well layed out. Apparently a British officer created the esplanade in order to enjoy a morning constitutional walk. The beach was wide and dotted with small fishing boats. Further south the slums sprawled directly onto it.
Pancha Rathas structure
There again was the unforgettable aroma of sun-dried and fermented fish.

We were heading south along wide boulevards and toll ways to the beach resort of Mamllapuram which is part of a playground for rich Chennai-ans. Obviously a lot of development has been happening in these areas. Major chains like Raddisson are already there. Mamllapuram stands out however because of the historical sites rather than just the beaches. Nice enough hotel with a pool and reliable Wifi. All of our gear was loaded into a single room and we all hired old push bikes for a town tour. A local guide gave us some pointers on avoiding the traffic but the bigger challenge was the old-style and low mounted handle bars that work to restrict your knees, particularly when trying to get off quickly – as tends to happen at all intersections. I chose the helmet as well. We rode down to a beachside historical site where temples and statues had been carved out of the granite, from the top to the bottom. This was no soup-stone but good old hard granite. Local tourists swarmed over the place. Turning back from there I witnessed a near head-on collision between
Within Pancha Rathas
two motorcycles, each with a pinion passenger. More noise than damage and a whole lot of head waggling seemed to convey blame and contrition at the same time.

Anne, DJ, Cath and I went down to the beach for a swim at about 1530. The beach was lined with fishing skiffs - half and full sized. The full sized boats had obviously been popped out of a mold. The half boats were a buoyant wood and only used in very calm weather. There was a reasonable surf running with a moderate undertow. The water was clean and a refreshing temperature. We Aussies swam while DJ took short dips, not being a strong swimmer. There was a pleasant cool breeze blowing off the ocean. Groups of young men were swimming and sky-larking near us. We took turns to watch our gear. Bluebottles without long tentacles, unlike the Australian form were scattered just above high water. I was impressed by the simple mount that attaches the engine-shaft-propellar assembly directly to the transom of the long boats. Also the improvised anchors. A groups of boys questioned Catherine who was walking ahead of me and until I showed up.

shops running back to our hotel had many gift and curio shops the type of one sees hundreds of across India. The touts were hassling for business. One tried to take us to his mate's workshop two minutes down the road by foot. I called in quits after about 100m - too many horror stories about ambushed tourist I guess.

We also visited an open air traditional dance show. While this sounds pretty touristy it was actually great. The show was presented to live music and clearly they had some dancers they were all proud of. Even the younger dance troops performed brilliantly. Lots of clashing cymbals, flashing eyes and unusual body postures.

It was a wonderful evening with a warm breeze blowing off the sea and a three quarter moon lighting up the beach.

The lovely church where we became the main attraction
We wound our way slowly up into the hills. The trip was slow but interesting as we passed pilgrims dressed in bright orange or blue jogging and walking up the hills, drove through villages with bullocks pulling laden carts, women doing the washing and the ubiquitous stalls. As we got higher we noticed colourful houses cascading down the hillside. At an altitude of 2133 metres we reached Kodaikanal. First impressions were not favourable, it is dirty and smelly and we wondered why we were here. There were issues with the hotel ( they insist it is not paid for) but they finally let us in. We headed out to Dominos Pizza for lunch and ordered vegetarian. It was very nice. Maddy was feeling poorly and didn't have any pizza. The poor thing did not make it back to the hotel. Roy was next to hang over the toilet bowl, quickly followed by Peter. Sue and I followed and Grant woke up ill in the night. Lois was the only one left standing. The next morning Lois, Sue and I felt better and went sightseeing with Antony, our driver. Turns our there are some very pretty parts of Kodaikanal and views across
Pillar Rock
the range are spectacular. We visited a lovely church where we got mobbed. People like to get their photo taken with us which is slightly weird but we usually oblige.
When got back the others were out of bed so we headed out for a walk around the lake. The atmosphere was similar to a fair, with stalls, food and games as well as paddle boats and row boats on the lake. You could hire bicycles or ride a horse - we elected to walk. Everyone is jaded and queasy so we look forward to leaving.

_MG_4016
14 Jan
We were loaded into two seven-seater vehicles which arrived a bit late - on Indian time. Smaller vehicles were handy because the roads became quite tortuous. Thirty six really tight switch-backs to be exact, coming down off the plateau after Ooty and towards Masinagudi. The terrain changed from lush rolling hills to dry open savannah. Between those we dropped perhaps 1000 metres down a steep ravine. Looked a bit like Africa except for the eucalypts and low undergrowth like lantana. The heat increased as well. The switch-backs were numbered and many turns showed announcements for free ambulance services, discouraging excessive speed. Even a sign advertising a free mortician van! At the bottom we were following narrow bitumen roads and dodging traffic. The savannah opened out a bit more. Outside Masinagudi village the forest thickened and our hotel, the Jungle Retreat, was nestled in there. Reception was like what I imagined a wildlife retreat might look like. Built around growing trees. Dirt floors. Lots of domestic animals.

We were staying in dormitories of at least six people. Little brick buildings nestle into the forest which had been recreated since the property was purchased a decade ago. The pool as
L1020018
like a watering hole in a game park, and consistently cattle and goats roamed around and drank from it. The whole area is open for animal to roam in from the animal reserves and the owners have photo-trap evidence that leopards, elephants and sloth bears are regular visitors. The pool water was cool and very refreshing. All members of the group took the opportunity to snooze in the warm afternoon. I had some time just watching and listening to the forest nd hearing unfamiliar bird calls and seeing monkeys cavorting in the top branches.

At about 1630 we were loaded into Jeeps and driven into the animal reserve for the evening. Along with dozens of other Jeeps we cruised slowly along the single lane roads spotting animals which were completely unperturbed by our passing. Amongst the group we saw (monster) squirrel, Asian bison, sloth bear, elephant, samba deer, spotting deer, mongoose, peacock and water buffalo. Macaques and Langur monkeys were common. No tigers unfortunately - though this would have been a real treat as they are increasingly rare. We have few photos of wildlife from this and subsequent walks, as we did not have our large telephoto lends on this trip.

Back to the Retreat where the owners presented a digital show on the concept of the site and the broad array of animals that come on through. Unlike other properties in the area, this one is not electric fenced. After a great meal, guests have to be escorted to their rooms by a guide just in case. The room was well set up and the facilities clean and functional. As all can imagine, there was a cacophony of sleeping sounds during the otherwise peaceful night.

Gandhi's wpords
12 Jan

We made an early start with a nice breakfast of ""dosa"" and headed to the station for a train headed to Incombatore. Ugly station but livened up by a group of black dressed pilgrims like we had seen a few days earlier. Noted the work of the guy putting drying powder on the poos between the rails of the platform beside ours.

We had second class seats which at least meant we had reserved seating. Third class you might need to fight off a chook or goat. As is customary the Wallahs walk up and down the aisles selling Chai tea, or deep fried snacks. Love the sing-song way they advertise their product. ""Chai Chai Chai"" sung in a baritone voice.

Our backpacks needed to come to the racks above our seats so there was some huffing and puffing to make that happen. its good we are traveling with a dozen people and it is pretty evenly distributed between girls and boys so the jobs get distributed early. I picked up a copy of a Time Magazine equivalent and caught up on some of the twists and turns of the Indian political cycle. Got up with
In the tea plantation
our gear to the doors well before the station so that we could stay together and not get overwhelmed in the crush of passengers joining the train.

As always we were happy to be out of the railway station with all its offensive smells and sideways glances. Onto a small tourist bus. It was pretty damn hot. All the gear was loaded into the cabin with us. Incombatore had little to recommend it but just outside we were taken to a pleasant public vegetarian restaurant. Here for 75 Rupees ($1.30) you can have all you can eat: with your fingers of course. We ate rice, plus four or five mild curries off big banana leaves laid directly on laminex tables. The process was one of washing one's hands first and then the leaves and then sambals, curries and chutneys were delivered from large stainless steel buckets. The locals have a very efficient way of scooping the rice and sambals off the leaf and into one's mouth. Simple.

Onto the bus again for a somewhat hair-raising climb up the mountain roads towards the hill station Coonoor. Along the way we saw the first of many floats celebrating local culture
Lunch is served
and democracy. The driver earned his keep by overtaking under challenging circumstances, and avoiding being run off the road by the crazies coming down the mountain. All turns, passing maneuvers or misdemeanors are accompanied by a toot of the horn. We gradually climbed higher and higher onto a plateau at about 1200 m. Palms and dense undergrowth along the way. Macaque monkeys common along the roadside. Beautifully cool and less humid up on the plateau. Some beetle nut palm plantations along the way.

We wound our way through the townships on the plateau to our hotel, which had a spectacular view to the east down the valley to the plains below. It was nicely nestled in amongst tea plantations. The group we are travelling with enjoy a drink and so whisky and gin were soon produced, and sundowner were served on the balcony looking down the valley. Cool air rolled in as the sun dropped. Wonderful dinner together with multiple curries, veg and non-veg as the say, and Kingfisher beer. Somewhat surprisingly we were able to step outside and fire up a camp fire using the roots of old, exhausted tea tree roots. Not tea tree like in Oz
Dawn over the tea plantation
but the gnarley roots of the trees trimmed for tea leaves. The smoke had a recognisable aroma. A clear three quarter moon rose up the valley and we had starlight. I can't say I heard the monkeys that apparently played on the roof, of the roosters that we obviously in the villages around us.

Can't say we saw any evidence of the English Raj - perhaps the railway bridges. Oh, and the system of government. Oh, and the ...

Tea plantation, Coonoor
Jan 13

We enjoyed a beautiful sunrise from the balcony of our room. One of those where one is looking down on the mist and smog of the villages down below, and the air is crystal clear above that layer. The green shades of the tea plantations were lovely, and the patterns of the tea plots, interspersed with White Oak trees, symmetrical without being manufactured. We enjoyed a late western style breakfast: Omelettes, pancakes, toast and vegemite provided by Stephanie from the group. We piled into the minibus and took the somewhat serpentine route to Swamy & Swamy tea plantations and processors. Hairpin bends like never before. The guide took us for an uncomplicated but enjoyable walk through the plantation, the factory and of course the store. A simple and clean operation that harvests, cuts, dries, ferments, sorts and packages tea. We got to try a chocolate-flavoured tea which was very pleasant. Along with tea the store sold all sorts of other natural products, with all sorts of amazing claims to efficacy.

On the way to the 'toy train' station, we enjoyed our first western-style coffee for a while in a joint just outside Coonoor. To all intents and
Ghandi's philosophies
purposes just like Starbucks. The chain is called ""A lot can happen over a cup of coffee"". Great name. Even Andrea from Italy, agreed that this was reasonable coffee. From there to some way down the mountain to Mettupalayam, one of the stations for the Nilgiri Mountain Railway - otherwise known as the toy train. We arrived a bit early to buy the tickets so we had a chance to walk the streets a bit and check out the steam train that runs the lower and steeper section of the railway using a geared system. We walked with the group to the market and photographed and experienced. Bought a brightly coloured equivalent of a Woollies shopping back for 40 cents. A gem.

The train itself was very quaint with little narrow carriages richly trimmed with carved wood. Actually the guage of the railway is 3ft 3/8 inches, and given that Queensland used to use 3ft 6 inch gauge, perhaps Queensland trains should also be counted as toy train relics of the British Empire? Ourselves and Phil from Canberra were joined in our little compartment by a young Indian couple from Hyderabad joined . The trip up to Ooty was
Climbing to Coonoor
pushed by a reasonable sized diesel electric engine. We did get to see the old steam engine, but perhaps it is too challenging for this longer distance. The terrain was lovely and green with rolling hills and scattered villages. The track passes through tea plantations and past temples. Little kids still get a kick out of it and waved to us all. Locals yelled as we went through the tunnels. We snapped photographs as we passed a large gathering of pilgrims in a paddock close to the line.

From Ooty station we looked across the township which is apparently a mecca for Indian tourists during the summer months. Like the British for a hundred years, they like to escape the summer heat and head for the hills. We sauntered through an extensive food market. People crushed in but very colourful and friendly. We enjoyed a pretty standard western lunch (tandoori vegie pizza) before walking up to the botanical gardens. Lots of people stopped us and asked to have their photos taken with us. This all seems a bit strange at first, but apparently many Indians still find caucasian faces unusual and exotic. Hundreds of Indian citizens enjoying the ambiance
Guide 'DJ'
of this simple hillside garden. Young Indian men made human pyramids and generally mucked up.

That night back at the Hotel we were again treated to an excellent Indian meal and we gathered for a camp fire - monkeys looking on from the trees around us. The Canadians prepares ""Smors"" which were a campfire creation of marshmallow and chocolate, sandwiched between too sweet biscuits (where 'biscuit' has the Australian meaning). Nice stuff. This night was as close as damn it is to swearing to a full moon, so the valley looked lovely.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Chidambaram
January 11th 2014
Published: January 11th 2014


Preparation for the tour



Actually I never had known about Pichavaram till a couple of weeks before I visited the place. I had only known that there are many places for backwater boating in Kerala. But while preparing for my Chidambaram visit I read about Pichavaram backwater boating in some blogs. I saw some pictures of the place. It looked quite interesting to me and I decided to go there.



However I had some fears too. First fear was the obvious risks involved in boating and particularly in forest-like environments. Pichavaram is the second largest mangrove forest in India and spreads over several kilometers. It is quite natural to encounter snakes and other dangerous creatures in such places. Besides I read in many blogs that the boatmen were asking extra money (300/- to 500/-) apart from the regular boating charges (150/- per hour) which you pay in the TTDC counter. I was scared of such huge tips as I was making a low budget trip.

Usually I do a lot of preparation before I visit any place. Before going Chidambaram and Pichavaram I referred to tourist guides and read personal experiences of people from their blogs. As I had visited Childambaram earlier I had nothing much to prepare about that. But I collected every piece of information about Pichabaram before making my trip. All those were useful not only to take better decisions but also to save me from problems and embarrassments.
Reaching there



We stayed in a hotel in Chidambaram. The first day we spent in visiting the famous Natraj temple and the next day morning started for Pichavaram. From hotel we took a walk to the Chidambaram bus stand (half km from hotel) and asked there about Pichavaram bus. Although I don’t understand Tamil, I have learnt an universal language. That is like “pichavaram… bus... where... time?” and accompanied with appropriate gestures. People of any language do recognize these words.

We came to know that the Pichavaram bus goes every hour and the bus named “Om Shakti” will go to Pichavaram. We had to wait for about 40 minutes for Pichavaram bus. The bus came at 8.30 AM. We got into the bus. The ticket was only Rs 9/- per head. It was probably the cheapest transport from only location to another I ever had. The bus halted at different places for taking and dropping passengers but finally after one hour took us straight into the TTDC (Tamilnadu Tourism Development Corporation) boating center of Pichavaram. No extra walking required to reach the place.
The boating complex



When we got down from the bus the first thing that caught our attraction is a statue of a two headed human (God?) sitting on a horse (picture below). This statue is there in the TTDC campus.



Then we saw the telescope tower. It was a tall tower with spiral steps. We went inside paying a small entry fee (Rs 5/- for 10 minutes) and climbed up the tower. The place was really fantastic to watch the beautiful sceneries around. We took some pictures of the place from that height.

There was a telescope in the telescope tower. They allowed us to see through the telescope. But it was quite poor and I could not really see anything through it. The 60x optical zoom in my video camera was much more powerful than that.


The boating counter



As I mentioned the whole boating complex is run by TTDC. There is a proper counter for booking the boats. There are two types of boats. Power boat is Rs 1000/- for 40 minutes (capacity-10 people) and rowing boat is Rs 150/- for one hour. You may book rowing boat for 2 or 3 hours depending upon your choice. There is no pedal boats or self-driven boats. I heard motorboats couldn't get into thin lanes, as they would go at high speed. We preferred booking a rowing boat.

When we stepped into the boat another person came and asked us for camera tickets (still camera Rs 25/-, video camera Rs 150/-). We paid for the camera and went into the boat. The boat was small to accommodate about 5 people (you can guess from the picture below).


Boating in the mangrove forest



The boat journey first starts from a larger water surface like a lake and then goes into the narrow lanes inside the mangrove forest. The green forest around us was beautiful. Boating as such was not so special as we had done two boating sessions (Paradise beach and Ousteri lake) during previous two days. But the mangrove views were interesting.

<span>Soon after the boat started the boatman asked for a big tip to take us to special locations. As I had read about the experience of other people I just took it coolly and agreed for a smaller amount. However, he was a nice person and I saw no threat from him whether regarding money or in any other aspect. He was rather explaining us about the specialty of the forest and the animals typically found in the forest. He also took our pictures. He was good in taking pictures.



<span>



<span>The boatman said the mangrove forest spreads on 3500 hectares of land (Wikipedia says 1100 hectares). There are as many as 20 different species of mangroves in the forest. The color of the leaves were dark green and the roots were dark brown. The color of the water was deep green and blackish. The sceneries were differently beautiful. The place can be scary to some people depending on mental condition. I remembered the Hollywood thriller “Black water” which was shot in a similar watery environment (However unlike ""black water"" there is no crocodile in Pichavaram)..

<span>Some people have mentioned about sea birds in Pichavaram. But we did not see any of them. Probably that period (December) was not the season for them to come. I was afraid of encountering some deadly snakes or dragons. But nothing of such kind happened.

<span>Bobby’s hat fell down in water


<span>
As we went into the narrow lanes of water, the leaves and roots were touching our heads. In many places we had to save our heads by bowing down. Some of the roots were very strong like solid woods. If you were unmindful the roots might hit your eyes or make you imbalance to fall into the water.





Bobby was lost in taking photographs. She was wearing my Vietnami hat. I told her to be careful about the roots and save the hat from falling. Few minutes later I heard her screaming “my topi… my topi…”. I saw the hat floating on water. Luckily it did not dip. We could go back to get the hat from water. The boatman said many people loose their camera, goggles, mobile phone etc. in the water. It is extremely difficult to recover such things from inside such stained water.




All is well that ends well



What we saw within a couple of hours was enough for us. If we had booked for 3-4 hours probably we could have seen some more interesting spots. But by and large we got the hang of the place. We saw some crabs and similar water creatures. The boatman said that there were foxes and seals too. I did not have much interest in searching foxes in the watery forest.

I had an interest in rowing and requested the boatman to give me the rows. I tried rowing the boat for some time. As the water was still I could easily got control over the boat to change directions. We had a full enjoyment of the place.





By and large I may suggest others the following:

-<span> There is no problem in going from Chidambaram to Pichavaram. Just go to the Chidambaram bus stand and go by bus. The bus will drop you straight inside the TTDC boating center in Pichavaram.

-<span> Some bloggers have mentioned that there is no food in Pichavaram. They are right. If you are looking for any solid food (like rice etc.) then there is no restaurant. But you can get there biscuits, chips, water bottles etc.

-<span> If you plan spending very long time in boating you may carry some food and water with you. If you just plan for a couple of hours then there is probably no such need.

-<span> While boating inside narrow lanes, be careful about the roots as otherwise you may loose your caps, goggles, camera, mobile phone etc. very easily.

-<span> Be prepared to pay some extra money to the boatman and don't get embarrassed or angry when he asks for that. He is your only friend inside the water.

January 11th 2014

The Pancharatha Temples



If shore temple is the most attractive point in Mahabalipuram then Pancharatha temples are the next attractive attractive points of Mahabalipuram. These are considered as world heritage sites of India.

The pancharath are the five rathas (chariots) made of stones. These chariots are named after the pancha pandavas of Mahabharata. Thus there are five temples for the five pandavas, viz., Yudhisthira, Bheema, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva.



Apart from the five rathas (chariots) or temples, there are other interesting stone carvings and statues. A huge stone elephant (picture below) and a huge lion are the most attractive monuments there. Those are very beautiful photographic points.



The stone carvings and sculptures of Mahabalipuram are very impressive. I first visited this place in 1985 with Durgesh, a friend of mine. Subsequently visited a couple of times and last probably in 2004. The most recent visit was in December 2013. The stone carvings were always attractive. There is no boredom even if you visit this place several times.



One has to do an entry ticket (Rs 10/-) to visit the pancharatha temples. The ticket is a combined ticket for both shore temple and pancharatha temple. This ticket is available at the counter in front of the shore temple. As I mentioned elsewhere still camera is free and hand held video camera is allowed on written request (Rs 25/-).



You may like to see my video on Pancharatha temples on youtube below.

The attractions of Mahabalipuram



There are three main interesting groups of attractions in Mahabalipuram. One is the shore temple (including museum and sea shore), another is the pancharatha (or pancha pandava) temples and the other is the group of caves, temples and other monuments on the stone hill. The last set of attractions include arjuna's penance, krishna mandapam, krishna's butter ball, ganesh cave, mahisa mardhini cave, trimurthi temple, the light house and few more. I have written about those monuments in a separate article.
The shore temple



There is an entrance fee of Rs 10/- to visit the shore temple and pancharatha temple (combined ticket). The ticket counter is there in front of the shore temple. As this is one of the UNESCO world heritage site (declared in 1984), you will get a thick colorful impressive ticket like that you get in Agra or in Konark. (The cost of printing the ticket would be about Rs 10/-). Other places (caves and temples etc. on the stone hill) are free to visit. The entry fee for foreigners are high (about 5$ ?). The still camera is free. Hand held video cameras are allowed on written request (Rs 25).



The shore temple is near the sea shore (bay of bengal). The shore temple is near the shore of Bay of Bengal. The difference is only a few meters from the sea which is now developed with plantations. (the sea is there behind the plantation behind me in the picture above).



This temple was built during 8th Century by the Pallava king Narasimhavarman. That time Mahabalipuram was a port for trading purposes. Now the northern side beach is used for fishing and is known as fishing beach.



There are temples of lord Shiva and Vishnu etc. The stone carvings and architecture of the temple are beautiful. There is a huge stone lion (picture below) and other interesting stone statues around.


Other things near the temple



There is a small museum near the shore temple.

There is a big temple pond around 100 mtrs away from the shore temple, outside the temple campus.

The sea beach is very close and visible from the temple.

Sthalasayana temple and other caves are about 200 meters from the shore temple. Pacharatha temples are about half km from the shore temple.
Mahabalipuram sea beach


Although the beach is visible from the temple you cannot go to the water from the temple because of the wall in between. You have to come out of the temple campus and go by the side of the temple to go near the water. You will find a lot of horses available for riding. Horse riding is 50 to 100 rupees, just sitting on the horse to take photo is 20-30 rupees.

VGP Universal kingdom is an amusement park about 20 Kms from Chennai. This is one of the oldest amusement park and has been quite popular in Chennai in past. The place is popularly known as Golden beach.



I have visited the place atleat 5 times at different periods, first time probably in 1985. During that time (1985) the ticket was probably Rs 30/-. We could see shooting of some Tamil films. The overall impression was very exiting.


(The statue man in Golden Beach)Subsequently when I visited the place I did not find any substantial improvement. However I liked the statue man as I had demystified the statue man during my first visit (that it was a man and not a statue). But there was nothing much to be impressed beyond that. This time when I visited the place, I was quite dissatisfied. Instead of a film shooting studio it has turned into an ordinary amusement park with wheels and merry go rounds. Some of the old statues are very badly maintained. This time the entry ticket has been increased to Rs 225/- for person, camera ticket Rs 20/-, Video camera Rs 50/- etc. Although the ticket rates are increased the inside is not maintained properly. While some of the rides are free with the entry ticket, I found many of those rides were unmanned so no possibility of using them. While there are some additions like aqua kingdom etc. they are separately charged. The worst thing is that the total size of the park is very much reduced. While the cement boat was very much a part of the golden beach now it has been separated and the security guard did not allow us to go towards that side. In my opinion the standard of the park has greatly reduced over time. From a film shooting point it has reduced to an ordinary amusement park. You may like to watch my video of the golden beach in youtube.

About Chidambaram


Chidambaram is about 78 Kilometers from Pondichery, 160 Km from Trichy, 50 Kms from Cuddalore, and 360 Kms from Bangalore. NH 45A passes through Chidambaram. Chidambaram is famous for Nataraj Temple, Chidambaram is another name of Lord Shiba. In this place Lord Shiba is worshiped as Nataraj, which is also another name of Lord Shiba. Inside the main temple of Chidambaram, Lord Nataraj (Shiba) and Lord Gobindaraj (Vishnu) are placed close to each other. Besides there are separate temples for Lord Ganesh and Lord Kartikeya (Murugan) in the temple premises. About half km from the main temple of Chidambaram on north side there is Thillai Kaali Amma temple (below). Kaali is believed to be the wife of Lord Shiba and Thillai Kaali Amma is believed to be dancing together with Lord Nataraj. (Picture in front of Thillai Kaali Amma Temple)
My first experiences


I first visited Chidambaram in January 1993. I was very impressed with its beautiful Gopuram and spacious courtyards in the premises. This time when I reached there (in midday) I saw the Gopurams were all closed. The views of the Gopurams were covered by recently constructed buildings, electric poles and wires. I was very disappointed and thought probably I won't see those beautiful views again. I waited till 4 o'clock till the temple opened. When I went inside the Gopuram I found it is all the same I saw 20 years ago. The same beauty, same charm and same peace. There is no unnecessary constructions, no shops and no disturbances inside. It is the peaceful land of Lord Nataraj or Chidambaram.
The four sides of the main temple


There are four beautiful Gopuram (entrance) at the four sides of the temple. On the east side of the temple one may see the big chariot of lord Nataraj (now a days totally covered to protect from rain etc.). The roads on the four sides of the temple are called ""car roads"" (car means ratha or chariot). Thus there are east car road, north car road, west car road and south car road at the outside of the temple. On the west side of the main temple (west car street) there are two small temples, Sirai meetta vinayagar temple and Kothandaramar temple. On the east side (east car street) there is Anjaneya (Hanuman) temple. As I mentioned above there is Tillai Kaali Amma temple half km on the north side of the temple. Besides there are other small temples in the town too.
The beautiful Gopurams


One may go inside the Nataraj temple through any of the four gopurams. Once you get inside the gopuram you will be in a different land with all stone constructions of old centuries. The views of the Gopuram can be described only through the pictures. One good thing is that photography is allowed in the premises and you can take pictures of temples, gopuram and temple pond etc. However photography is not allowed inside the pooja places where the deities are worshiped. That is also good as not to spoil the spiritual atmosphere of the inside places.
The Temple Tank


The temple tank is one of the most beautiful places inside the premises. It is a huge tank full of water. The reflections of temple structures on the water look extremely beautiful. There are enough space on all four sides of the tank for doing pooja and other rituals. One can easily spend hours near this tank, one of the finest place to experience the peace of spirituality. (Picture of Shivaganga, the temple tank)
The name of the temple tank is ""Shivaganga"". It is said that the water never dries in this tank. Some people enjoy feeding the fishes in this water. Next to the tank there is a place called ""thousand pillar hall"". The beauty of the pillars and their reflections in the water cannot be described in words.


My last Impressions


While my first impression on the temple was great my last Impressions were even better. I was very impressed to see that there is no shops inside the temple premises. All shops, whether flowers, candle etc. are outside the Gopuram. As there are no shops there is no business activities inside the temple. There are no touts also. The place is just perfect to experience spirituality irrespective of whether you believe in Shiva or not. Apart from visiting Nataraj and Gobindaraj temples, we also visited Kartikeya or Murugan temple and Ganesh temples inside the premises. As we were there in the evening we could see the Aarati of Lord Nataraj which was a great experience. As we stayed there for two days we visited the temple again on the next day too.
Some Other Remarks


- You will find quite a few restaurants on the streets outside the temple. However, the price of food has increased everywhere during last 5 years. You will get plenty of large size bananas for 5 rupees each. - The temple premises is really large. You will need quite some time to cover all the places. It is advisable to keep atleast 2 to 3 hours to visit the temple. However, if you have more time you will not feel bored. - Pichavaram is 18 kms from Chidambaram. If you are fond of eco-tourism you may go for a back water boating in the mangrove forest of Pichavaram.

Shore Temple beach
Had one of the most amazing days.

I rode in with one of the early shifts to pick up Mike and we went to Mahabilipuram to go pick up $70 USD worth of rocks that I bought. Yes, rocks. And yes they are heavy. And yes, they are coming back with me to the states. Plan one was to arrive at Mahabalipuram and pay for my rocks then head to the Raddison to go out on the Catamarans (as lovely sign posted said). I use the term ""Catamarans"" loosely here, and you'll see what I mean when you see the boat. Seas have been too choppy to go out the past week or so and as we arrived and inquired about the boat rides, we were told that again, today there would be no boat ride due to safety hazards (blah blah blah...). I at least wanted to stick my toes in the waters of the Bengal Sea so we headed down to the beach and started walking towards the Shore Temple. It was amazing because the entire time we are walking I am finding these beautiful sea shells that are funny shaped on one side. As we get closer
ocean
to the Shore Temple we realize we are on the OTHER SIDE of the fence that surrounds Shore Temple. The fence keeps people from going to the jagged rocks where the ocean meets land and makes this amazing ""crash"" sound. So, here we are, Mike and I, climbing around on sharp and very tall rock piles taking photos on the outside of a huge tourist destination. Some people are waving from behind the fence, we wave back. We keep walking the narrow path along the fence line and find a spot that seems like it would be the furthest point on Shore Temples little beach filled with rocks. As we are taking pictures, these military guys start HOPPING OVER THE FENCE in order to take pictures/be where we were/take pictures of us. Super nice, but very funny to watch these guys in uniform hopping over a really tall fence. Farther along the path it breaks way to the other side of Shore Temple where a bunch of locals are playing in the water. There are lots of people, little stands full of snacks and food, people selling things, and a tiny little merry-go-round swing thing (see pictures, I have no
mike, panorama
idea what that thing was called). There were also horses.

This part was pretty cool, I took the horse across the beach and got to look at the waves crashing and the guy let me take the horse on my own for a bit. [ ]

I love to ride, and this was great.

December 31st 2013

Total Distance: 59.29 miles / 95.41 km
Mouse: 0,0
Places visited. Route should be decided by the individual based on the time and day. Local Tourist operators will be of help to get the best route to travel.


Thanjai Peria Kovil
Just back from a trip to Kumbakonam -Tanjore the Temple Town in Tamil Nadu.

This is my third trip to the place and every time it’s a new discovery a new dimension that gets added to what little I know about the place.

The Very fact that so many big temples are nearby each other heralds the Greatness of its rulers.

Each and every temple had a story to say, a story to see.

Let me start first with Tanjore Peria kovil.A place visited by lot of us and still we might not have seen the ""Man with a Hat"" (Might be a statement on the sculptures to state that our people had link to the Western World even before they came to conquer us).This temple built by Raja Raja Cholan ( only the main shrine) and later the Sarabojis Added the Murugan Sannidhi , has a see alike built by his followers Rajendra Cholan and Kulothunga Cholan . If any of you are Visiting Again Make sure you visit Dharasuram and Gangai Konda Cholapuram. These places have Similar construction to the Main Peria Kovil but still are unique. However I missed Gangai Konda Cholapuram, But will
Check out the design on the Horse.
go back for sure.I was always of the impression that the Shiva Followers (Saivaits) and Vishnu followers (Vaishnavites) where not co existing but the Gopurams on the Entrance had a different story to tell. One can see the Narasimha avatar , Krisha leela and Varaha avatar Depicted on the entry Gopuram showing the importance that they gave to each other.

Godhandaramaswamy temple - Situated near Tanjore Next to Punnai Nallore Mariamman Temple is a shrine dedicated to Ramar and has Pattabisheka Rama made of Saligrama Stone. A place to visit for the Calmness around the place and the Divine feeling that pours with it.

Kumbakonam was our next stop.This place has on offering a wide range of Hotels for all Budgets but when you are going in the peak period better get pre Booked.

A Big list of temples are available to visit.

You can decide based on your taste and there are some options like

1. Visiting the Heritage temples

2. Visiting All Navagraha Temples

3. Visiting Vaishnava Deviashetrams 2 in Tanore. 11 in Kumbakonam, 3 In Mayiladuthurai and Nagapatinam each.

4. Go on a Secular trip and Visit Nagore and
Peria kovil - The View i like the Most
Veelankani

Or as I Did just Visit Temples Nearby and having a historic story attached with them.

If you are planning for visiting the temples in this Area Kumbakonam should be your place where you put your Tents on.

Giving an account on few places I have visited.

Dharasuram - Not many know about this place. If You are visiting as part of Pilgrimage people might not suggest this place. This Temple has Dance as a source of inspiration for the sculptures. The minute Faces on the Pillars still show so much of emotions. Thou ASI has taken lot of steps to renovate this place and UNESCO has added it in the list of Heritage sites, still the Grandeur of this place is still not recreated. The walls seems to have been painted as well when it was originally constructed. The Dancers the Swan which could still be seen in certain places showed that the Tamilians where not only masters of sculpture but Painting as well.The Sculptures on the wall are a kind of Embossed architecture and is Unique here(Or did I Miss it in other temples).The Sculptures are the best among the temples Ihave
Krishna leela on 2nd Gopuram
visited. A must see that I will suggest.

Kumbakonam Temples within city -Sarangapani, Chakrapani, Ramaswamy and Kumbeshwarar Temple. Each had a history to tell and we where trying to cover as many temples and couldn’t Find time to go thru the details.

There is a Temple dedicated to ""ThirumalZisai Alwar"" Near to Chakrapani temple.It is said that Alwar was doing Penance and had controlled his Breath hence he was mistaken to be dead and samadhi was built.The temple was build With him still inside alive and doing penance. It is believed here that he will again come out During Kali Yugam to Sing Pasurams on Kalki Avatar once he is born.

The Ramasamy temple has Ram with all his 3 brothers, all made of Saligramam Stone. Sarangapani temple has 4 Narasimhas in the same Temple.

Nachiar Koil Situated around 10Km from Kumbakonam might not be known by many.The main attraction here is the Garudalwar Who is kept in a separate Garbagriham and is made of Stone. The same Statue is also taken out once a year on ""Urvalam"" outside also. This is the only temple where the Stone Mulavar of Garudalvar is taken out as Urchavar
Narasimha avatar on Thanjai Koil Gopuram
also (Normally Metal or Wood is the choosan material for Urchavar). Its said that Initially only 4 People will be Enough to Lift the Stone Urchavar inside the Garbagriham but once outside the Garbagriham the Stone Urchavar gets so heavy that it will need 8 people to do the same. As the Urchavar Moves thru the 3 Praharams it starts getting heavier and takes 16 then 32 and then 64 People to Carry the Urchavar.

Alangudi- Guru Stalam

ThiruNageswaram - Raghu sthalam

Upiliappan temple ,

Shwetha Pilliar (Here Ganapathy is made of White Sea Coral and is a Swayabu).

Thirubhuvanam -Architecture and construction is similar to the Thanjai Peria Kovil and was built by Kulothunga Cholan.

SuriyanarKoil - Suriyan Sthalam

Kanchanur - Sukkiran Sthalam

Thanks to PLA Residency, Thanjaore and Rayas Annexe , Kumbakonam for the Excellent stay and a Neat Food.The Service was Good and to the requirement.

Tea estates on the way while travelling by Bus
This is the mountain that you see in the left side when you travel from Mettupalayam to Coonoor, also called as Hullikal Drug. The peak of this mountain has the ruins of the old fort used by Tipu Sultan (called as Droog fort) during the 16th century. It has an altitude of over 1900 metres and full of tea estates like Glendale and Nonsuch.

I wanted to go trekking here for a long time, and yesterday I finally went there.. The trek was a wonderful experience and the scenery was marvellous.. The climb was steep and very difficult but it was finally rewarding as it gave me an unforgettable experience...

Through these pictures I will take you through the same journey I went through and show you everything that I saw.. I had called my friends to accompany me and no one was ready to take such a physically demanding trek in an isolated area like this especially during winter. I went on my own and joined a group of college students from Tirupur who had come for trekking as well. I met them after getting off the bus that came from Coonoor which dropped us until Droog bus
DSC04675
stop, which is close to the Nonsuch tea estate.

I started from Coimbatore early in the morning at 6 AM and reached Coonoor by 8:30 AM. There are only few buses to Droog and Bakkasuran malai (also spelt as Pakkasuran malai) and so I had planned to take the bus that leaves at 9:15 AM from Coonoor to Droog. Droog is just one stop before Bakasuran malai, which is the last stop that you can reach by bus if you want to trek this place.

I was very eager to watch the scenery on the way. The bus passed through Katteri Junction and then crossed the bridge above the Katteri river. It is also possible to trek from Law falls that is on the way to Mettupalayam to this mountain's view point and the Droog fort. But taking the bus is a lot quicker and easier though the trek from Law falls must be more rewarding than this one.

After crossing the Hullikal village, the bus stopped right before the Nonsuch tea estate for a break. I got off the bus to take some quick photographs as it gave an amazing view of the Coonoor and the
DSC04682
mountains. The Nonsuch tea estate also has a retreat where one can stay (Rs.3000 per couple during off season and Rs.3500 per couple during the season time). If you stay there, you can go trekking from the estate at a cost of Rs.500 per person and their website says that they take you to various other places in addition to the Droog Fort.

The last stop was the Droog bus stop after which one had to walk nearly 4-5 kilometres, the last of which is a steep uphill climb through the jungle for at least 1 kilometre. There is a couple of small shops and some small houses near this bus stop. Not knowing where to go, I made friends with a group of college students from Tirupur who had also come for the same trek.

As we started walking from the bus stop, we can see the view point in Bakasuran Malai, far away on the top of a hill that is covered by clouds. We crossed the Bakasuran Malai bus stop, started walking amidst the tea plantations and then started climbing uphill after a long walk of over an hour. It was very steep, and had
DSC04692
a few steps that take you through the middle of jungle. There are a lot of bisons in the area and so it is advised not to go alone to this place.

After the hardest part, we finally reached the top of the hill where there is a view point that has a few steps to climb. You can sit and relax there and enjoy the view. When we went there it was covered by mist. If it is a clear day, then you can get amazing views of Mettupalayam, Coimbatore, Kothogiri and many more.. From the view point we still climbed further to reach another place full of rocks. We saw a ruined stonewall near the viewpoint which I believe is the ruined Droog fort used as an outpost by Tipu Sultan during the 16th century.

After passing the time enjoying the view and taking pictures, we headed downhill and walked through the village near the Bakasuran malai bus stop. Through tea plantations we reached another view point where there is a huge cell phone network tower. You can see this tower when you travel by Mettupalayam to Coonoor ghat road.This offers some wonderful views as well
DSC04693
and unfortunately we can't see anything due to the thick mist that had covered the valley below.

Christmas Breakfast
25th December

It may be Christmas Day but no let up for us with the sightseeing. We were off to Trichy for the day, about 60km journey and picked up our guide on the way who was an Eddie Murpny look alike with the grand name of Marharajah. We visited a river which is a sacred place as all rivers are, this one has holy men, astrologers and various other people with weird and wonderful functions. People were bathing in the water, part of which was barriered off for safety but plenty of people were beyond the barrier where 20 have died in recent years in quick sand, some were doing their washing or washing themselves and others just sitting. Astrology plays a big part in arranging weddings and there were loads of astrologers waiting for customers, barbers seats where all hair from your body would be removed. There was a poor elephant here too, his back legs chained together.

We went on to a huge Hindu temple complex with lots of the colourful towers covered with the small figures of gods telling various tales. This area is known as the Temple heartland of Tamil Nadu and we went
Washing at the River
up on to the roof to see the amazing array of towers which really were stunning. Inside was just as amazing with fine carvings on the many walls and a view to the 1000 pillar hall.

After this we went to our tour operators office as we needed to pay some money for the stuff that had been fedexed back. Indian Panorama is the company and we can't praise them highly enough for organising such a fantastic holiday. We arrived as they were having a Christmas celebration in their courtyard and they were so pleased to see us it was quite overwhelming! They made us so welcome, Father Christmas trotted over and they made us feel like highly honoured guests. There was a wonderful Christmas cake of Santa which Sal was asked to cut. We were so glad we owed them money giving us the opportunity to meet them particularly a lovely lady called Sindhu who has been there if we needed her. It was great to see people of all faiths celebrating Christmas.

We came back to Tanjore with a visit to the palace where the king still lives in a small part and we think this
Holy man
is the one who isn't too popular as he isn't a Tamil, but we might be wrong as the temples and palaces are blurring a bit. The temple, known as the big one because it is big with a huge stone Nandi, sacred bull, this was the place for a spectacular sunset, however, it didn't oblige. It took us ages to walk around as so many people want their photo taken with us or the kids just want us to take a photo of them so that they can see it on the back of the camera.

We then visited a small house where they make metal ornaments using the Lost Wax Process, any guides reading this will remember their training at the British Museum which included this process so it was fascinating to watch as they gave us a demo going through the various steps.

None of us will be converting as far as religion is concerned as we are all too soft footed, having to take your shoes off to enter, sometimes, we have left our shoes in our little bus as there is nowhere at the temple and the monkeys pinch them. Sal being flat
Shrine at holy waters
footed and with creaky back has certainly had enough of being shoeless.

We had a second night at the Ideal River Resort and Sandier said we had made her evening the day before and she would remember it for a long time and hoped we would too.....Jane can, she can still taste the cream. It was such a shame for them that there wasn't as many people there as they would have liked, but they did well.

26th December

Waved off by Sandier next destination was Maduraihome town for Bala, as usual passing lots of interest, one of the strangest was maize drying in the road, they spread it out all over one half of the carriageway, which by the way are much better and generally have Tarmac in this state, sometimes there is a small amount and sometimes it covers about 100 yards, the funny thing is there never are birds around, you'd think it would be rich pickings for them. We passed fields of cashew nuts and people roasting them on the side of the road, we stopped and watched, as always, these people working hard to scratch a living. Driving by a river, there
Astrologers
would always be laundry being done, often more than personal laundry so loads of it hanging out to dry, saris laying on the ground making colourful patterns, other stuff on what ever was available, we had our clothes laundered at various over night stops so ours was probably hanging from a tree somewhere at some point.

It is festival time in Kerala and many pilgrims make their way there. They fast for 1, 2, or 3 months, not food fasting but no communication with their wife, wear no shoes and make the pilgrimage to a particular temple, if you are really devoted or maybe mad you walk, for so this could be 300k with no shoes, some go by car, which are packed with people and decorated with flowers and same with coaches. We passed one particularly colourful group pulling a cart and feeding the monkeys as they were going along.

We passed building sites that had a figure like we would have made for Guy Fawkes hanging outside, this was to stop any evil entering the building during construction. There is obviously a brisk trade for granite, a huge slice of rock removed looked very odd, must
Procession with temple background
have been a huge task to cut but looked like a cut in a loaf of bread.

The most ridiculous thing happened to us when Bala spotted sugar cane being loaded on to a truck. We stopped for a photo as men were lugging the cane through the field and then hauled up on to a truck. We realised there was a tv crew there filming so we took pictures of them and the sugar cane. They asked if we would mind being filmed, Sal was nominated spokesperson but with a language barrier and Bala laughing Sal stood there, being handed sugar cane to hold, then asked to look as though she is eating it which they liked and then one of the men brought a bundle of it for Sal to hold, it was very heavy. They then wanted Sal to say something......er........ Knowledge of sugar cane roughly zero ........but Bala to the rescue, in between laughing, he said that all the fuss was because this was the last harvest of the season and Tamil Nadu sugar cane was the sweetest, so this was repeated to camera by Sal and a batch of 3 microphones. Col was then
Santa and Sindhu
asked to come and hold the bundle of cane. How funny was that!!!!! Even funnier, Bala said he saw us on the breakfast tv programme every hour being repeated and we also made it into the daily paper! Ha ha!!

Our hotels have been fantastic and this one had a new feature for us, we each had our own little swimming pool. The rooms were huge with an equally huge bathroom which was all granite, an enormous slab with a modern sink on it and a shower with enough room for a football team!

Our guide was Sundrum, he spoke good English at a good pace. Some of them have quite heavy accents and are hard to follow but if speaking slow enough you can fill in the gaps, however, they sometimes get into their stride and talk faster and loose us, Pete usually admits to being lost before they say a word! Bless!

He took us to the Palace which is just a museum today, descendants of the Kings of the area are still around but live in poverty having lost all power and status. The building was quite magnificently carved and parts had recently been
Temple at Tanjore
renovated but more to do. It is quite sad that they allow people to touch and climb over some of these magnificent buildings and monuments, not just here but all over India, the ones in Mahabalipuram really do need protecting. We then went onto St. Mary's Cathedral, this area and going Into Kerala has a big Christian population.

Madurai is Tamil Nadu's second largest city and a centre for pilgrimage and has an enormous Hindu temple called Meenakshi (we think) having left shoes (ouch ouch again) we joined a long queue to be thoroughly searched. The place was heaving with people, many on their pilgrimages and this would be a stop off point. We went to the hall of 1000pillars in the temple where in the old days, 2 lengths of sari material would,wrap around 4 pillars creating a bit of privacy for a family on their pilgrimage. A quick bit of retail ( hasn't been enough time for that) then back to our lovely hotel.

Kristin on Marriage alter 2
I think I will skip telling about the temples. They were extremely cool and we walked barefoot through thousand year old temples but you can google the info or look through my pictures to get a good grasp of that.

What I would like to tell you about is the Children's Home we visited. Billy had a contact with a Madam here who ran a home for children and he secured us an invite to come play with the children.

After arriving through the gate, there were a group of girls playing in a little entrance area. I actually am not going to talk much, Ill just post some videos for now.



Here was the greetings we got... [ ]

Resort transport
21st December

Today was a travelling day, we were flying to Delhi and then on to Chenai. Our driver wanted to get us there early because there would be loads of sugar cane trucks on the road and they could hold us up but we suspected that it was because a) he didn't know where the airport was and b) he had to drive back to Delhi. There has been really bad fog in Delhi since we left so we were still not certain that all would be ok but fortunately it was. The airport was newly built and freezing cold, the mornings and evenings have been cold but this place was steel and glass and always going to be cold. We queued to get into the airport as our documents were checked, we then queued to get through the next door as our documents were checked..... Queuing is not something that Indian people are familiar with, to them It is like driving, see a gap and go for it. Eventually we got checked in which took forever and then had to pay excess baggage which took forever + +++ so we were educating them In the art of queuing
Pool at Mahabalipuram
as they had no choice but to wait behind us. Our excess baggage was puzzling them, they had sooooo many forms and we had to pay each person and per flight so it turned out to have been a good job we were so early as with the amount of form filling we did we would have missed the flight. A very persistent young lady had been suggesting we would like to use the lounge for just 99 rupees..£1. Once everything had been stamped, checked, stamped and thoroughly checked we went to her lounge where there were no seats left !

We were bussed to the aircraft which was about 20 yards away but the bus took the pretty winding route. All this is job creation and why not employ 30 people where one could do, why not check a boarding pass 7 times when one would do. What made us laugh though was they must have forgotten a lady in a wheelchair who was due on the flight and they were pushing her at speed across the runway whilst she was hanging on to her baggage for grim death!

We sat down and we were off, it
The Butter Ball
was an easy jet type flight, if we wanted food we would have to buy it but as the flight was only 45 minutes we weren't going to bother. However, having been in the air for about 20/25 minutes, they started handing out boxes of food which they never actually finished doing as they ran out of time! We are then starting the descent so the trolley is taken away and they are running up and down the cabin telling you to put your table away...........you don't have to think too long about the state of the aircraft with half eaten boxes of food strewn all over as they couldn't collect them!

We had to transfer flights so back through more rigorous security checks, they literally scan each person and pat you down too though there are no restrictions on water, strange there're is no international standard. Whilst we politely wait for our turn, others are wriggling their way into a gap to get one in front!

The fog at Delhi was bad though we had been told it was better than the last 4 days when large amounts of flights had been cancelled, we got away on
Cave temple
One piece of rock
time and arrived in Chennai. Our new driver Bala was there to meet us. Lovely chap, big welcoming grin we knew he would be good.

We were staying 2 nights at Mahabalipuram, it was a resort type complex but our very spacious rooms with the best beds so far, overlooked the palm trees and sea.......wonderful. There were several restaurants and The Wharf was near to us which we used on both nights, food was excellent and a lovely waiter, Shantaraj looked after us, who is getting married next year and we are sure we will get an invite to the wedding!

22nd December

Our guide the next day was Prabu, Very tall with lovely black curly hair which was unusual. There are not a huge amount of sights in Mahabalipuram but what they had was stunning and did have wow factor. First we went to the butterball, this enormous rock, precariously perched on more rock, it looks like it could topple over at any point. Many have tried to shift it including the British trying to move it with the aid of elephants. Close by is a cave temple which has been carved out of a single
Decent of the Ganges
piece of rock, more than 1400 years old, it is beautifully carved both inside and out depicting stories of gods and this is followed by a huge relief carving on the rock face, called Decent of the Ganges,again carved with various figures from Hinduism and a couple of rather lovely elephants. We were hotly pursued by various sellers of wares and our NOs we're not interested turned into us buying a carved stone elephant each with another elephant inside, they are clever but we probably paid too much.

We moved on to another group of 5 small temples, also carved out of the rock together with a splendid elephant, all of these are Unesco world heritage sites and stunning, partly because we had never heard of them but mostly because they were fantastic to see. The Shore Temple was also on the itinerary as it overlooks the shore of The Bay of Bengal, again 1400 years old and survived the 2004 tsunami, which devastated the area. Our guides English was petty good, odd words we couldn't get, one occasion was in this temple and he was talking about a representation of the god Shiva in the form of a
Shore Temple
failus, we didn't understand, the poor chap started to explain when we twigged ...... Phallus! Not sure where his explanation would have led.

The weather was about 29 degrees and with some time to ourselves, a dip in the infinity pool was welcomed. The hotel was a vast site with 2 pools and various activities, golf buggies were constantly driving around or you could phone for one to take you from a to b.

23rd December

Pondicherry was our next destination, the area had been under French rule until 1954 and the policemen still wore similar uniforms to the French. The town has new fame as being where the film Life of Pi was filmed. Our hotel was another beautiful heritage building, we were greeted with floral garlands of yellow marigolds and something sprinkled on our heads. They had a fab Christmas tree made out of old newspapers and all the decorations were made from newspaper as well which all looked surprisingly good. Bala our driver took us on a walking tour of the newer part of town which was a hustle bustle of shops and then into the market, which started off as a stinky fish
5 temples
market with lots of old fish wives who were not the happiest bunch and then on to the fruit and veg, which, as always is incredibly fresh and then the flowers, not whole flowers but stall after stall of people picking all the petals off and then making them into garlands for people, for your house or for temples, their hands were so nimble working with cotton and tiny petals.

We had a guide in the afternoon and it was a lady called Arrol, a feisty lady! First stop was the paper making factory, they use just about anything to make different quality of paper from old t shirts to tea dust to the waste from sugar cane. Health and Safety at home would have had apoplexy knowing that a) the place existed and operated and b) Joe Public were walking about there. They had a shop which had lots of interesting pieces at good prices. We went to the temple and she explained a lot about her religion but so many gods and so many stories it all becomes very confusing so we have decided to go for the enjoy for the moment option and some info will
The Wharf restaurant with Santharaj
eventually stick, however there is a god for just about anything and Col and Pete were interested in the king of the beer, something like Mallya! People were sitting around the temple meditating, some on their knees praying and others making offering or puja as they called it. When we were at the Golden Temple, our guide Jesse bought some food offering, as this was being sold beside the lake which was full of big fish, Pete thought he had bought it as food for the fish, Jesse looked slightly horrified!

The town used to be divided into two, black and white now usually divided into 3, French, Tamil, Muslim. Our expectation had been quite a small place but in fact the town is big.The French area is where we spent most of our time with some nice colonial buildings and the seafront itself was alive with people and stall holders and in fact you could have been in a seafront town in France. We had coffee in the cafe on the seafront and it was interesting speaking to our guide as she certainly didn't put up with any nonsense from anybody and was very keen for traditions, customs,
Where's she gone
religion to remain as they are and not be lost. Her favourite phrase started off... It has been scientifically proven........ we were not sure where she might have got her ideas from! One of her funniest was that the ladies have long plaited hair and wear flowers in their hair to protect there head if they have a motorbike accident........ Actually, wear a crash helmet and don't drive like an idiot would help!

Apart from being much warmer in this area, which is called Tamil Nadu, on the whole we were finding it much cleaner and certainly the roads were better. More ladies wear saris and the men wear doti which is a long wrap cloth like a skirt, but with a quick flick and a knot it becomes short for working

24th December

On the road again, lots of Ox drawn carts on the road, no camels, elephants or horses. We went through a little village where rope was made and Bala stopped for us to have a look, the family were very welcoming and invited us to come closer to see what they were doing which was using the husk of coconut, very labour intensive
Recycled Christmas tree
but speedy too though tough on your hands, Col had a go and it was a bit like using a spinning wheel for wool. They gave us a length to take away, their kids were very keen for pens so we managed to find them a couple.

We love these journeys, always so much to see, fields of rice and sugar cane, busy villages and small towns, small shrines and larger temples, and the array of goods being transported on overloaded shoulders, bicycles, tuk tuks, tractor trailers, never ceases to amaze us. Two or three on a motorbikes not usual and 4 up is frequent but we have got to a 5 and looking for a 6 !

Our destination was Tanjure but we picked up a guide on the way as we had two temples to visit at Kumbakonam and Darasuram both of which were spectacular, the details in the carvings were so fine. We also visited a large lake which is used for special religious days and one of the temples with the very colourful towers which are common in this area, they are covered with sometimes, 1000's of little images of gods and are wonderful.
Fish market Pondicherry


We also saw several crocs as we crossed a bridge.

It was dark by the time we were getting to our hotel which was on a river, so, time for a driving lesson..... How to drive in the dark...... Of course the answer is exactly the same and putting your lights on is optional, even if you are on an unlit road and wagons drawn by oxen are on there too, unlit of course.

It was Christmas Eve and the hotel had a 'gala dinner' which we really weren't interested in but had no option if we wanted to eat. We arrived at the hotel to a lovely welcome and at this time of year, people decorate their doorways with colourful pictures made out of coloured ground rice and the hotel had a beautiful one. We were greeted by a lady called Sandier who was very pleasant and keen for us to join in the festivities.... Of course we had a Colin with us who was up for everything, don't you worry he told her, you and me will be boogieing the night away... Not sure if that was what she had in mind, games, oh yes
Making Garlands
says Col, count us in, groan, groan, groan from the rest of us.

We had about 45 minutes to freshen up. The restaurant was by the river and out in the open so having showered, we had to smother ourselves in insect repellent. Loads of tables were laid but only about half were taken which was a shame as they were very excited about it and obviously felt it their duty to provide a Christmas celebration for us. Sandier was very pleased to see us arrive and Robin, the manager, in his very white and orange trainers was equally delighted and ever so slightly over excited. The meal was buffet and there was so much of it, they must have completely over estimated numbers and as it was in the middle of nowhere they weren't going to get passing trade and we were sure the locals wouldn't have been able to afford it.

To whoops of delight from Robin, Santa Claus arrived, he was wearing a Santa mask which we had seen for sale in various places and looked slightly menacing, he carried a walking stick and trotted, even when having his photo taken, he was bobbing about,
Garlands to buy
he carried a bag and gave out sweets. We came across a couple more Santas on Christmas Day and they were all the same!

They had traditional music and dancers which was lovely to watch, we were tired and wanted to slide away but Robin and Sandier were there like a shot and we felt sorry for them after all their efforts, so thanks to the wonderful Col, we made up 50% of the contestants! The first 'game' was Merry Cherry..... They put 6 cherries in a bowl, filled the bowl with disgusting sweet cream and we had to get the cherries out without using our hands, a Dutch lady was doing quite well but spitting the pips at her husband..... ours were keeping a safe distance! Jane hates cream of any sort, particularly this stuff but she persevered and won! Next game, the men had to sit in a row and the ladies were blindfolded and with the aid of a wooden spoon had to decide which was there husband. Robin really was excited about this...groan, groan, groan..... Jane went first and got it right, the two other ladies got it right, then Sal went last and did
Coffee in Pondicherry
get it right but they swapped them for some of the waiters so it was a bit of a shock when the blindfold came off!

We were awarded prizes and Jane having starred in both games was crowned woman of the year and awarded an extra prize and we feel it is our duty to give her due respect for her 7 days as Woman of the Year. Well done Jane, that cream was awful.

I left off last night talking about the Elephant Temple and being blessed after seeing Auroville.

So I was blessed and sat on top of the elephant- then blessed again. Chelsea takes her turn getting on the elephant and being blessed, and then Mike and James got blessed (big slobbery elephant kisses) while my mom was being the amazing photographer. We started to walk around the temple we were in and this little old lady had baskets of what was kind of a puffed rice and she was motioning for us to throw it in the main square (empty at this point in time, but I'm sure in its hayday it was full) to offer the rice of offerings for ""wealth, health and happiness"". So I tried gracefully to throw the rice puffs in a very nice arc, but all of my throws tended to turn out me chunking the rice into the fountain. The blessings still count I think, I did get the rice into the fountain.

In the temples, you are required to wear no shoes. That day we just so happened to hit a quite a few temples. We went to the Kamakshi Amman Temple, the
20131228_011903
Varadharaja Perumal Temple, and the Kailasanatha Temple. I do not have a lot of information on these temples, but if you google it, I'm sure there is plenty of information. These temples were over a thousand years old and it was amazing getting to walk through them with just our little group and a ""not a guide"". (the term ""Not a guide"" has come to mean someone who actually IS a guide, but they call themselves temple workers so that they can kind of wiggle tips and money out of you at the end. Don't worry, there will be a lot of stories about ""Not a guides"") Oh, I almost forgot, at this one temple, my mom found a bundle of twigs that the women here use to sweep the temple steps, and she picked up the bundle of sticks and started to sweep. Apparently she was doing it wrong and the Not-A-Guide showed her how to do it the right way. She now has a job from 6 am that pays 10 rupees a day sweeping temple streets. I think my grandma will get a kick out of that.

At this point and time Chelsea and I are

December 26th 2013

Big a$$ rock
I believe when I left off, it was right before Christmas. I've done more shopping at Spencer's Plaza, and done a few other touristy things. Chelsea and I added each other on facebook and realized we knew a lot of the same people (No joke, this world is a small place). Chelsea and I had lunch after Spencer's at the restaurant at Phoenix Mall. This is kind of where the story gets a little awkward. We had been walking around the mall, and came upon Nando's to eat where a line had formed. We queue up and the male host makes eye contact with us and asks us how many. We say two- and he has us jump the entire line to eat at a booth that could have easily fit 4 to 6 people. I felt bad skipping the line but there is not of options to decline.

After we eat, Chelsea and I are walking back and we have to cross that one intersection, so we are stopped at the corner waiting and this older gentleman just looks at us and says ""come, come"" motioning for us to follow him. He safely leads us across the massive intersection.
Slide
I told you people were super nice.

I think after lunch Chelsea and I went walking out of the hotel to the right and went looking for a tailor to fix my jeans. It didn't really work but we were able to see a bunch of cool shops. At one of the outdoor ""Big Lots"" aka ""Big Bazarr"" I was able to pick up two shirts for 50 rupees each. (...um.. right now 100 rupees is $1.62). Happy about that grab.

Then back to the hotel, where Christmas was had, and what happens at the Westin is staying at the Westin.

Fast forward to this morning, Chelsea and I rode in with Harsha to work so we could pick up Chelsea's dad and head to Mahabilipuram.

Fast facts about Mahabilipuram: "" Mahabalipuram is located right on the Coromandel Coast next to the Bay of Bengal. It was a well established sea port during the 7th and 10th centuries of the Pallava dynasty, and has flourished accordingly.

This city was actually the 2nd capital of the Pallavas. It was originally named after the rude, cruel, and arrogant King Mahabali who was killed during a fierce battle
Carvings of temples into rock
by Lord Vishnu at that location. It was named by the people more out of gratitude that the heartless king was killed there than out of respect upon his death for his leadership.

During the rule of the Pallavas, new styles of art and architecture were pioneered. Mahabalipuram is where they tried and then exhibited their new artistic and architectural creations. As a result, the area is brimming with rock-cut caves and numerous temples. In fact, this region is often referred to as an open museum. Some of the temples were even carved out of one enormous rock rather than simply constructed out of rock. Not much pillaging has occurred here over the centuries, since the wealth of the Pallavas was never flaunted, so the temples are well preserved. ""



So we initially set out to go see the underwater temples while in Mahabalipuram but today the swells were to high so that didn't quite go as planned, but we were able to go to the park and see the temples. The first thing we saw was a huge egg looking rock that looks pretty cool. You can climb up to it and make it look
Elephant carving into rock
like you are rolling it, you know, the funny pictures thing. right beside the rock is a patch of slick rock that you slide down. It has been worn down by so many butts over the years that you can actually get some speed when going down. So we are walking around all these temples which were AMAZING. If you want to read more on the temples, there is

As we are walking through this park with the temples, a bunch of ladies with kids and one male wanted to take our picture with them. We hand them our cameras also to get pictures, and I am being grabbed by all directions to stand next to a certain person then everyone would shuffle and someone new would put their arm around me to take a photo with THEM closer to me, same with Chelsea and Mike. So Chelsea busts out her amazing tiny polaroid camera and takes a picture and hands it to the two little boys. That started something with the group and EVERYONE wanted one of those tiny photos. I mean it makes sense, how many times do they develop pictures with themselves in them? I
The photo fiasco
think it's one of those things that I have taken for granted, always having pictures of me or digital copies of myself. Back to the story, they were super impressed and we spent the better part of 40 minutes taking more photos and were only done when the camera ran out of the polaroid film.

We continued walking the park and all the little kids want to say hi to you and say ""my name is..."". There was this little two year old who followed us and than found a crevice in a rock and sat in it. He did the entire ""it fits, I sits!"" action and pretended to hide from us. Super cute kid.

And here is the part of the story where the monkey comes in. We had tried to give water to the monkeys before, but it was early in the day and they were completely uninterested in anything we had to offer. Now it was getting later and I was getting thirsty and had completely forgotten about playing with the monkeys. So I'm taking a drink of my water and slowly a monkey just dead locks his eyes on my water bottle and
showing camera
starts coming for it. Not going to lie, I was kind of freaked out so I'm kind of trying to hold on to my water bottle, and Mike had just said not to give it to them in front of people, but this monkey really wants this water bottle and I'm not about to get in a fight with a monkey over a water bottle in the middle of India. So Mike is saying ""give it here, give it here!"" I hand it to him like its a bomb and Mike sets it down on the ground and we all kind of scoot back and watch as the monkey proceeds to grab my water bottle, go up to the next rock and OPEN IT. (no joke, the friggin monkey twisted the top of the bottle) and sits there and drinks my- (his) stolen water. And that's the day my water got stolen by a monkey. I've got a video, I'll be sure to post the link as soon as it uploads,--

[ ]



After the temples in the park, we went to see the main attraction, the Shore temple. We did the tourist thing and walked around
The monkey that stole my water bottle
the temple, took our shoes off and went up to the alter. That thing was crazy ancient and really amazing to see.

Fast facts about Shore temple

""The Shore Temple

The Shore Temple occupies a most extraordinary site at the very margin of the Bay of Bengal so that at high tide the waves sweep into it and the walls. For this reason their sculptures, have been eroded by the winds and waves of thirteen centuries.

The Shrines In The Shore Temple

There are 3 shrines in the Shore Temple. Two of them are of Saiva and the third is of Vaishnava, with an image of Lord Anantasayi made of live rock. There are Vimanas over the Saiva (also spelt as Shaiv or Shaiva) shrines, but none over the third; it seems to have disappeared with time. Built by Narasimha Varman II Rajasimha, the maker of the Kailasanatha temple in Kanchipuram in the 8th century, this is one of the earliest structural temples in Tamil Nadu. ""





Enjoy the pictures ya'll, and Merry Christmas. We will going to Pondicherry tomorrow for more sightseeing and fun! Much love

December 23rd 2013
Published: December 23rd 2013


Street vendors
-- So it's raining here. I'm going to take this opportunity to blog real quick about the first day or so in Chennai. We arrived pretty late the day before last to the Chennai Airport, SO MANY PEOPLE. Trying to get our bags was just.. well.. it would have been funny if I wasn't so tired. Basically there are a million people trying to do the same thing at the same time, with no queuing, or lining up. Everyone is very helpful, it is just hard to get anything done fast when everyone is trying to get things done fast.



Driving in Chennai [ ]

We get into our cab, and we have a substitute driver- because our original driver hit a cow a few days ago and his car will not be fixed for a while or a few days, not exactly sure. We arrive at the hotel and the guards at the gate knock on the window and give us these mint things that are like small mentos candy. They always seem so happy to see us. Get to our room, and shit-you-not the show ""Outsourced"" is playing.. ( I am not making this up)
rickshaw
The rickshaw began as a two or three-wheeled passenger cart, called a pulled rickshaw, generally pulled by one man with one passenger. The first known use of the term was in 1887.[1] Now there are also the cycle rickshaws, also called pedicabs, auto rickshaws and solar rickshaws. Pulled rickshaws created a popular form of transportation, and a source of employment, within Asian cities in the 19th century. Their popularity declined as cars, trains and other forms of transportation became widely available. Auto rickshaws are becoming more popular in some cities in the 21st century as an alternative to taxis because of their low cost.

Fast forward to the following morning. We headed out to Spencer's mall. Spencers's mall is like a high end flea market. The good kind. Stores have names but items don't have price tags. You haggle for what you want. The driver dropped us off in the basement, we used the ATM machines to get rupees. Which when you see your bank account number in rupees, you feel like a millionaire because the ratio of rupees to USD is ridiculous. Something crazy like 10,000 rupes is 160ish USD. Your bank account ends up having like a ten digit number when you print your receipt.

We went to the ""rock shop"" first, where some of the other people we are with had items on hold with this one vendor. It was kind of crazy to watch how the haggling went down. Chelsey wanted some jingly ankle bracelet things, and she could not decide, so the vendor hands her and entire bag full of silver chains and told her to take them, pick through them, and then let him know which one she wanted in a couple of days. This would never happen in the US. Who the hell hands you a
Cows
bag of silver and says come back later when you decide. I have heard that it is not uncommon for this to happen, one story was told to me that went along the lines of a guy wanted a rug for his house, but he wasn't sure of the three he had picked which one his wife would like. So the vendor sent ALL THREE carpets (at no charge to the customer) to the house where she was able to pick which one she wanted and to send the rest back at the vendors expense and then negotiations on the rug that the lady picked out would then begin. Crazy. Okay, well crazy to me.

Spencer's is great because it has this one store, the Cookie Man, where (did you already guess??) cookies are made! They have all kinds and always give you a free sample when you walk up to the window. Spencer's Mall also has anything and everything you have ever wanted or not wanted. Barcelona (and every other team) jerseys, Dr. Dre Bose Headphones (50 bucks by the way), silver, gold, carpets, incense, healing rocks, nick-nacks, carved elephants, lock boxes, jewelry in all stones, golds, silvers,
The Cookie Man
and anything you can imagine. Once we were done wandering around Spencer's, we walk down to the basement where our driver dropped us off, and he was taking a nap in the van, and when we were ready, we took a drive to the beach.

One game commonly played here is how many people you can spot on one motorcycle. The most I have seen is four. But I think someone holds the record of seeing 5 people on one motorcycle. It's kind of a fun game once you get used to it.

So driving down the beach, it is depressing, and interesting at the same time. I saw this kid maybe 10 or 11 years old stripped down to his underwear dipping a bowl in a huge trashcan size bucket of water and splashing himself clean. Other people were not so lucky. I'll let the pictures show you what I saw, but it is truly poverty. You don't get in the water. It's not that kind of beach.



We get back to the hotel and got another mint from the guards, and drop most of our belongings off at our room and then head
By the beach
out to Phoenix mall. To get to Phoenix mall, we have to walk out the doors of the hotel, down the path, past the guards (who this morning I saw take a mirror around the entire car to check for bombs or people or something) Here's where the fun begins. You can't walk on the sidewalk because there really is no set sidewalk. It is all kind of crumbled and covered in trash, and the trees grow over and around it and barbed wire hangs down, so if you are not careful, you get a face full of barbed wire (happened to Susan last night). Instead, you walk in the street, but see, everyone else is walking in the street too. And there is so much honking. They are not honking because they are mad or anything they are simply letting you know that they are coming up on your side and don't want you to step out in front of them. So, walking in the street you are looking up to not run into people and things, and looking down to make sure you don't step in animal feces, or on a dog laying down, or over a person,
no shoes
or into a car, and you are looking left and right and behind and in front of you constantly because traffic comes in ALL directions, regardless of the road you are on and/or how thick or narrow the road is. There is no such thing as a ""lane"" or ""traffic light"" and the biggest vehicle has the right of way.

So back to crossing the street. I think I deserve a gold star or something for making it across a major intersection, not just a street, but a barrier divided two lane road on both sides coming to a ""T"" with another cross street. This is the street we have to cross in order to get to Phoenix mall. I am sure I will become fluent with street crossing soon enough, but for the first 24 hours, that was enough. So all in all, to sum up the first day,

1. People are so nice here. Like super NICE.

2. Haggle for everything. Nothing is really priced what it seems

3. Crossing the street is scary as all get out

4. If you see a mosquito on someone squish it first, then apologize AFTER you
Family in the back of a fruit cart
squish it

5. Tip everywhere. People remember you, your name, and where you are from. They will remember if you were rude or not. I don't know where they store all this information because I cannot possibly remember everyone's names, but they sure do. It will come back to haunt you or help you, so treat people very nicely.



That's it folks. I'll keep you updated with new adventures... I have heard rumors of snake catching (catching cobras with sticks and whatnot) and I know we are trying to get to the Taj Mahal around January 4th. There are many activities and places to go and people to talk to and pictures to take. Love ya'll and take care!

On the 25th November, myself and seven fellow dancers travelled to Chennai for a four day night shoot. Chennai is a city in South India and the fourth largest in the country. As we flew in I could see that the buildings of the city were all different colours and fairly low in height - a nice change from Mumbai's maze of beige/cream high rise apartment blocks. On the drive from the airport to our hotel I also noticed there were loads of cows wandering around at the edges and sometimes on the busy roads. Unlike the black and white dairy cows I am used to seeing at home, these were huge creatures with humps on their backs, folds of extra skin underneath their necks and huge horns which were painted red. I have seen a few cows like this in Mumbai, but here they seemed to be everywhere! Unfortunately, as I was shooting a film song 6pm - 6am each night and then sleeping most of the day, I didn't really get a chance to see much more of Chennai, however the set we were working on was beautiful.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Pondicherry
December 2nd 2013
Published: December 2nd 2013


First few days in India were easy and not so intense ( as India can be) , as I was met by Katie Pye and Bala our Tamil taxi driver sent by Tia the art therapist I am working with...and after Bala drove skillfully out of Chennai dodging the melange of moving vehicles and cows, dogs, goats & people, not slowing down for anything until a snake crossed our path on the highway south...we turned off the highway at a juncture obscurely signposted towards Auroville, which is a haven of low rise jungle green after Chennai and the drive south through coastal marsh land and open fields.

We were to have a sneek preview of Auro while dropping off Krisey, Katie's friend to stay with a woman who's had a long time association with the place. The ""house of curves"" is where she was staying. This is my name for the house; as all the lines flowed, apparently a popular Auroville architectural style. The names here tend to these types of associations; ""New Creation"", ""Certitude"", ""Serenity"".

Lara gave us an intro to who Sri Aurobindi was. Poet, mystic, revolutionary, writer, visionary whose ideas such as ""divine anarchy"", and invested energy and presence, along with ""The Mother"" were foundational in Auroville. This of course makes me want to know more about him and ""divine anarchy"" and her of course. We head of to Pondicherry and find the Park Guest House..which is associated with the Aurobindo Ashram, so the style is simple, clean, but I didn't expect the palatial size of the rooms....we are blissed to have such a room where we can come together in the middle but have beds that are so far apart that its like we have a private space.

The outer area of Pondicherry is Indian, as you get closer to the sea colonial architecture dominates. Unsurprisingly its called ""the White area"". Some of these extraordinary buldings are renovated or being so, others have small trees growing from them and are objects to dream on, so massive and beautiful they are in their ""post colonial"" deflated faded glory. Expressive Arts centre, hotel, both in one building... Here the streets are less busy, and on Sunday even quiet.

As well as Auroville, this really is Sri Aurobindo and The Mother's town. Their pictures are in shops, hotels and many buildings are associated with them in various stages of their lives. Some show them holding hands. I wonder how rare this is in India, if there have been other male and female avatars...

The second part of the wedding took place in Chennai. The first evening was a reception with only close friends and family. This is where they cut the cake and fed each other. This is also were booze was allowed, where the dancing happened and the party carried on until 5am (without Vikash or Shankari who had to make sure to look presentable for the next day). Indeed, the next evening was another huge reception, the couple stood on stage for about 3h while people would take turn on stage to greet them and have their picture taken. End of all the celebration.

La deuxième partie du mariage a eu lieu à Chennai (Madras). Le premier soir, ce fut une réception avec seulement les amis proches et la famille. C'est là qu'ils ont coupé le gâteau et s'en sont mutuellement fait manger. C'est le seul soir où on a eu de l'alcool, où on a dansé et la fête a continuée jusqu'à 5h du mat' (sans Vikash et Shankari car ils devaient avoir l'air présentables pour le lendemain). Le lendemain soir s'est tenue une autre réception gigantesque. Le couple est resté sur scène durant environ 3h pendant que les invités

défilaient pour les féliciter et se prendre en photos. La dernière soirée.

November 12th 2013
Published: November 12th 2013


01-Kanniyakumari-From Vivekananda Rock
Glimpses of Kerala-2 : Kanniyakumari


Kanniyakumari is in the state of Tamilnadu. It can be included in the Madurai-Rameshwaram-Kanniyakumari circuit or perhaps easier option is to go via Trivandrum / Kovalam. From Kovalam, the distance is just 90 Km but like most of the places in India, the distance should be measured in time and not in kilometres. It takes three hours. We had omitted local sightseeing in Trivandrum to include Kanniyakumari.

Vivekananda Rock is the main attraction of the Kanniyakumari. The name of the place is derived from the temple of ‘Kanniyakumari’ – Parvati. Gandhi memorial is another place visited by tourists.

Island of Vivekananda Rock is about half a kilometre off the mainland shore (southern-most tip of India) and can be reached only through boat service run by the port administration. Mainly because it was festival season, the rush was extraordinary with a queue of about 1.5 Km to the ticket window (Rs. 34 per person, return fare). It took 3 hours in the sun to reach the ticket counter. Ticket can also be obtained without waiting in the queue on some higher payment (Rs. 169s – official rate). The sad part of the story was
02-Kanniyakumari-From Vivekananda Rock
not waiting in the queue but the fact that tickets at higher rate were available and we didn’t know. The information is not displayed anywhere except at the ticket counter – which you reach only after waiting in the queue! It is not displayed even at the gate of the port. Communication with local people is very difficult as very few people speak or understand Hindi.

Apart from historical significance of the Vivekananda Rock, cleanliness at the Memorial was noticeable in spite of thousands visiting the memorial on that day. There are several shops selling books and other memoires of Vivekananda. There is a meditation hall. Indiscipline of tourists was visible here. People just don’t understand the meaning or significance of the place they are visiting. Jostling and cell phone rings violated the atmosphere in the Meditation Hall.

Opposite the Memorial is Kanniyakumari Mandapam. Here there is a rock with natural shape of foot print – supposed to be foot print of Goddess Parvati who did tapasya at this spot to marry Shiva.

Close to Vivekananda Rock, on another Island, there is a huge statue of Tamil poet and Philospher, Thiruvalluvar.

Kovalam-Kanniyakumari-Kovalam is a morning-to-evening tour.
07-Vivekanand rock




Our next destination was the back waters of Kumarakom.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Tiruvannamalai
September 28th 2013
Published: November 17th 2013


Storm on the way
Sometime I do a have a question for myself whether I really do believe in god or it was the myth which drives me to ‘bow’ in front of the Almighty. Life was playing a hard ball with me and I was traumatizing on how to deal with it. I knew that sooner or later I had to stand in front of any temple seeking blessings and pouring ‘amens’. This Southern part of India mainly Tamilnadu has a lot of Temples to offer. Almost all of them has some or the other religious ‘to do’s’. It was really a long list to chose from. Above all, to any temple, I just stand motionless and enjoy the architecture, the religious beliefs and moreover the colorful offerings. Don’t know if that makes my god a happy one. This last week of September shows the pathway to a few of the upcoming celebrations like Dussera,Diwali which makes an utterly chaotic crowd to rush to all the temples forming a ‘mini Chennai’ everywhere. So, I had a few days left to call for one of them.

It was a java session with one of my Team members in the office and Baskaran, one of
Maharshi Ramana Ashram
my best buds spoke about Tiruvanamalai and the ‘Holy Giribalam’. Diving down the memory lane, I knew it wasn’t far from Chennai and can be covered during the weekends. I took it up and finally decided to have a ‘let’s see what is in there’. Here I had to thank my wife for becoming the ‘lone soldier’ holding my fort and asked me to move ahead, all alone. Poor lady, had to stay back to take care of the dogs.

‘Hey, isn’t Thiruvanamali close to Gingee Fort?’, it was the first reaction from my wife.

‘Yes, it is, in fact, if traveling from Chennai, one has to cross Gingee and driving further 50 odd miles, you get there’, I replied knowing that she beholds the dream to stand atop Gingee fort and on a lot of occasions, we decided and later dropped ‘Gingee Fort’ from our list for some or the other priorities.

‘what else? Head it for, but make sure you are going to visit a Temple, not on some photo tour’, I knew that this was coming from her.

‘Yeah, will try but I must take the camera along to show Tiruvanamalai to you
Priests
through my eyes’, I was smart enough to convince her

‘Yeah, that’s what you say all the time’, she replied with a witty smile.

Saturday morning it was and the first hurdle came out pretty soon. I didn’t have a single lens with me. All of them were sold out recently. My secondary stand by ‘Nikon’ needed some patch work done. Oh !! ‘What would i do now’ was the first reaction and it was enough to spoil the entire plan. I knew that without a camera, I won’t hit the road even it takes all from me. Called a few friends, but they didn’t seem to be not available or had some engagements. Arvind didn’t turn me down as he did in yesteryears. He managed to get me wide angle lens which was enough for me to click at least a few.

I knew that Tiruvanamalai has a rail station too however the train services were not frequent and hence a ride would be nice enough to get me there. Since i moved in to this new house, the Chennai Central Bus Terminus has become an extinct place for me. After chasing the place through google
The decoration
maps, I found that a lot of buses take a pit stop at Perungulathur which is not only a place where I visit everyday for my work but also close to my house. Like all my journeys, I packed a few regular things, a pair of shirts and my best friend, ‘Canon 50D’.

It was 1:30 pm and I was anxiously waiting at the Perungulathur bus stop. I could see all the buses plying to all other places in Tamilnadu but still a ‘no show’ for a bus towards Tiruvanamalai. The watch clicked 2:00 Pm and still I was browsing for one ‘big board’ which says ‘Tiruvanamalai’.

‘Senji, Senji, waanga’, a TNSTSC bus stopped in front of me and the conductor was calling everyone.

‘Tiruvanamalai? Or last stop at Senji’, was my question.

‘Senji, last stop sir, from there take another bus’, he replied in broken English

I knew the locales call ‘Ginjee’ as ‘Senji’ and this place comes between Chennai and Tiruvanamalai. So, I hoped in however as promised my better half to not to visit ‘Gingee Fort’ without her, I decided to keep ‘Gingee’ for a separate tour.

The route was straight,
The Saint
80 miles hovering through the newly tarred GST road up to Tindivanam which took just over than 2 hours and then the ‘Green Rider’ took a right towards ‘Senji’ or ‘Ginjee’.We had been cruising through the GST road and then after switched to hit the NH 66 which connects between Pondicherry and Krishnagiri. It was muddy and dusty because of some patch work was on. Soon after crossing the market streets and the bustles of Tindivanam, the hills started showing up at the backdrop. I was enjoying every bit of the ride.

‘Senji’ has a strong historical connection to The Legendary Marathas since the Shivaji Era and the fort was constructed by no other than him. I heard that people here in ‘Senji’ still speak Marathi dialects and traders,army personals from ‘The Maratha Empire’ visited this place on deputation and finally grew their roots. Though I didn’t notice any bit of Maharashtra anywhere. However, it was a scenic drive for another 1 hour covering 18 miles and the bus reached ‘Senji’. I was in the middle of a busy bus stand of a tinsel town with a few daily dwellers rushing here and there. The bus stand itself had
The Watch
some views to offer, small hills surrounds the zone and a few ancient artillery establishments were also visible atop. I was feeling hungry as the lunch got settled somewhere in between. After grabbing a quick bite, I was at the ‘Senji’ bus stop again and in 5 minutes I saw another ‘Green Rider’ with a ‘Tiruvanamalai’ written in big and bold. I saw a few people dressed in all saffrons marching through the road and later I saw them in Tiruvanamali as well.

‘Senji’ to Tiruvanamalai’ was merely an hours drive however this bus took almost 90 minutes to reach. We crossed small villages in between. All of them look pretty similar with a big bus stop, a few shops and smiling local people. We crossed Malampundi, Killpenathur, Kadambai and then finally reached Tiruvanamalai Bus Stand at 6:00 PM.

‘Oh ! Fantastic’, that’s what I could say after a first glance at the ‘Arunachalam Hill’. The moment you get down at the bus stop, the first mighty monolithic hill will greet you and that’s Arunachalam, the almighty himself, Lord Arunachaleshwara.

‘The spiritual heart of the world’ that’s what Bhagavan Ramana Maharshi described Arunachala Hill in one of
White Nandi
his preachings. ‘Aruna’ means ‘red’, like a fire and this is ‘Gyanagni’ or the ‘Knowledge of wisdom’. ‘Achala’ means ‘Immovable’ and hence The Arunachala Hill is the ‘Hill of Wisdom’ The column of Engulfness.

I had to find a place to stay. Hence, I deiced to stay close to the main ‘Arunachaleshwara Temple’ which is just a mile away from the Main bus stand. Unlike other Temple Towns like Varanasi, Ujjain, Puri Tiruvanamalai is a small one one if compared and maintains the tidiness from all aspects. I found most of the lodges and the hotels next to the main entrance of the Arunachalashwera Temple. I found myself settled in one of them. Clean rooms with attached toilet was offered for Rs.300 @day and before the Hotel guy changes his mind, I took the offer. It was almost 7:00 Pm and I knew I had to complete the ‘Giribalam’ or ‘Giripradakshina’ tomorrow early in the morning.

Most of the devotees who visit Tiruvanamalai do this ‘‘Giripradakshina’ which is walking through the circumference of the Arunachala Hill which is about 9 Miles/14 Kms.

The ‘Giripradakshina’ has two routes, ‘The Outer route’ is a paved one however ‘The Inner
Simha Teertham
Route is through the dense forest and requires permission from the forest dept,Tiruvanamalai well in advance. Myths say that during the ‘Giripradakshina’, one actually goes through the path which has a lot of medicinal plants around the hill whose scents,wafted by the breeze are beneficial to health.

Myths apart, I woke up at 5:00 am early in the morning and after a nice hot water bath, I stepped my feet on the ‘Giripradakshina’ route. I got the necessary ‘do’s and don’ts’ from my hotel folks and accordingly i decided to go barefoot which actually everyone supposed to go while doing the ‘Giripradakshina’. All they said was,’walk slowly’ and keep ample of water with you which was a great help to me later part of the day. I started from the main Arunchalashwara Temple, as a part of the ‘Giripradakshina’ route flows through the streets of Tiruvanamali and my first stop was at ‘Indra Lingam’. To my readers, during ‘Giripradakshina’ one has to visit 9 lingams and they are in as per the following order if started from the ‘Main Entrance of the Arunchalashewara Temple’

1) Indra Lingam

2) Agni Lingam

3) Yama Lingam

4) Niruthi
The source of wisdom
Lingam

5) Surya Lingam

6) Varuna Lingam

7) Vayu Lingam

8) Kubera Lingam

9) Essanya Lingam



Next stop was at Bhagavan Maharshi Shree Ramana Ashram.The place was so serene, calm and peaceful. Peacocks would love to pose for your clicks. A lot of foreigners were also seen at the Ashram. I wished to spend a day t the Ashram, however due to the upcoming Navratri festival, a lot of guests had expressed their wishes before me. If you are really busted and stressed out with you daily city hustles, this is the place you would be spending a few days. I was running out of time and unwillingly left the place.

After visiting first four lingams, I reached Surya Lingam and there one of the most surprising thing happened to me.

I was taking snaps at the Surya Lingam and suddenly found an old lady starring at me.

‘Look at you, why so stressed?’, she really surprised me with her question.

‘Me, stressed ? Yeah, a little bit, nothing major’, was my counter reply

‘No, my son, you look very stressed’, she smiled and asked me to
Arunachaleshwara
follow her.

Just next to the main temple, there was a small hut and as I entered, I found a very old priest offering his daily puja. The walls were covered with the pictures of all possible god/goddess I have ever come across. The old man was merely in mid seventies or eighties, neatly dressed like a priest and with his gestures, he asked me take a seat. The room was filled with a nice aroma of sandalwood which makes the ambiance a bit smokey but more heavenly.. For a a moment my exhaustiveness were all gone and I closed my eyes and felt I was sinking deep inside of unfathomed depth. He had a nice smile on his face which was pleasing and within minutes I felt home. He asked me to do some practices everyday which would help me to gain confidence. After spending some more time and clicking a few more shots, I said good bye to his family.

I continued with my ‘Giripradakshina’ and clicking shots till 12:30 am almost and during different stages I took pit stops. If you are doing the ‘Giripradakshina’ during day hours, you would get some small shacks selling
The Chariot
Tea, Coffee, Soda, Mineral Water and some Fritolays. Keep sufficient changes, as you will definitely meet some saints and they would love to share their experiences, blessings and story of some supernatural incidents that has been moving from mouth to mouth for years.

I reached back to my hotel room at 1:00 PM and after quick lunch, I decided to make visit to the main Arunachaleshwara Temple. The temple reopens at 3:30 pm and there were tickets available for ‘darshana’ based on the size of your pocket. The temple was huge and perhaps the 2nd largest in Tamilnadu after the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. It has stepped tank and total 8 sanctums. Photography is not allowed inside the temple and I didn’t want to break the rule.

At 4:30 PM, I started from Tiruvanamalai and this time I got a direct fleet to Chennai, finally reached my sweet home at 10:00 PM. I don’t know what I have gained or what else could have done however if you talk about ‘Giripradakshina’ , streets of Tiruvanamalai, small decree (or degree) coffee stalls and mostly the people of Tiruvanamalai had a lot to offer which I believe creates a place
All Saints
for the almighty to stay there. After all it’s the human who created god.

Notes :

Chennai to Tiruvanamalai is about 190 kms, Buses ply in every 20 minutes from The CMBT Bus Stand.

Tiruvanamalai has a few basic hotels/lodges for stay.

During ‘Giripradakshina’ carry some water (must if doing after the sunset)

Try Decree coffee at any of the coffee stalls, the aroma has more to stay

Beware of the monkeys, better not be friendly or aggressive to them.

For ladies, if doing ‘Giripradakshina’ alone, it is better to do it before sunset, some isolated incidents have been reported.

If one can’t walk for 9 miles, ‘Giripradakshina’ can be done by car as well.

To do ‘Giripradakshina’ through the Inner Routes, get permission from the DFO office in Tiruvanamalai.

This is a temple town and each and every house has some or the other myths and stories, better to respect the same and not dig out the originality or root. After everything lies within yourself.

The best time to visit Tiruvanamalai is during Kartheeka Deepam, The next full moon after Deepavali.

Walk slowly during ‘Giripradakshina’, plenty of
Way to eternity
resting places, toilets have been constructed by the Temple authority.

September 22nd 2013

Kovai-Salem
cloudy sky
Started our journey from Coimbatore in the morning after breakfast from the hotel where we stayed overnight. It was around 160 km to Salem andfrom there 180 km to Chidambaram. The sky was cloudy as it was raining the day before in Kerala. In September mid the rainfall was not unusual in TN also.




Mid way we found a nice veg cafe at Avinashi on the highway side. We had some tea and snacks there and continued our travel. The sky was clear then, which also en-lighted our enthusiasm!



We reached Chidambaram by 2.00 pm and proceeded to Hotel Shardaram for checkin. It’s a decent hotel near town bus station and you will get a good AC double room in the range 1500/- bucks. Had our lunch at their restaurant on the ground floor.



Without sparing much time we moved to Pichavaram, a tourist spot situated 20km away from Chidambaram towards the coastal area. (toll Rs.50/-). It is said to be Asia’s largest mangrove forest. You can enjoy boating amongst mangrove trees here. There is a watch tower (entrance fee Rs.5/-) and a small park.



There was ample
Salem to Chidambaram
sky is clear
space for car parking. Shardaram group has another accommodation here.



Opposite to the boat jetty the calm tiny park attracts one’s attention. We spent some moments there. The sunshine was not intense, though it was only 4’ O clock in the evening.



One curious thing - we found crows bigger than normal size on the coconut trees around the park.



It was good time for boating. For a one hour ride on a row boat for two it costs Rs.150/- (the rower will be there). Speed boats are also available. The boat will take you to the inner parts of the mangrove forest.



One can see the thick and large mangrove trees very near but as told by the boatman not possible to get inside the same, though you can ride around.



It was an interesting trip and we returned the starting point exactly after one hour. A nice place not much exposed to the tourists. If you wish an early day ride you can stay over here also in the various resorts.



We came back to hotel and in the evening
Watch tower - Pichavaram
View from boating point
visited the famous Nataraja Temple.It is believed that the location of this temple is the center point of world’s magnetic equator. Muruka and Ganesha are on both sides of the entrance. The huge stone pillars depicted the art work and sculptures of the Chola Dynasty. Lord Siva is in the pose as performing Ananda Thandava (Nataraja) and left to the idol he is believed to be in continuous dance with his consort deity Sivakami Amman. A curtain covers this space which is known as Chidambara Rahasya, parting the curtain during rituals represents removal of ignorance by revealing Lord’s presence.



After twilight the keerthanas spread around which made the atmosphere more pious and devine. Lots of devotees sat in silence on the outside stone floors of the temple along all the four sides. The four gopuras stood shining as if enjoying the mantras. Here goes all your tensions! After spending one hour time there we returned.



Next day morning we once again visited the Chidambaranathan. There is a devi (Thillai Kali) temple also on the north side.



Opposite to the shrine of Shivakami, situates the Sivaganga tank.


Boating place - Pichavaram
View from Watch tower

Newt we proceeded our journey to Vaitheeswaran Koil, 26 km from Chidambaram on Tanjavoor route via Mayiladuthurai. This is not a highway, but good road. The temple is situated on the road side.



Vaitheeswaran is also Lord Siva known as God of Healing, devotees believe that prayer to him can cure all diseases. Here one of the Navagrahas, Mars (Chovva or Kujan) is also worshiped. The Vel Muruka shrine is also here. The place is also known for ancient Nadi Jyothisha.



The temple has five storied gopura. The temple tree is margosa which possesses medicinal properties and is located in the eastern gateway.



It is believed that Rama and Lakshmana worshiped the deity here. The pond in the temple is called Jadayu Kundam, it is also believed that Jadayu has been cremated here.



After the visit we further proceeded to our next destination, Trichy.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Kodaikanal
July 18th 2013
Published: August 9th 2013


Our destination
Our arrival into Kodaikanal was unpleasant to say the least. Not so much the overnight train journey we had just endured to Kodai Road, but more so the drive from the here to our accommodation.



You see once you have reached Kodai Road station, there is still an 80km drive from here to Kodaikanal proper. Being that this is a climb of around 1000 metres, you would expect this to be a pleasant journey up the mountain soaking up the views on route. Unfortunately, the driver of our taxi had other ideas, and decided that rather than let us take in these splendid views, he would race up there like a lunatic as quickly as possible whilst overtaking on blind bends with his hand constantly resting on his horn for ‘safety’, as standard here. Vomit from both Donna and I seemed imminent.

Luckily, after shutting our eyes and making the horror of car travel all go away, we made it in one peace to the town, and upon opening our eyes, we were greeted with a scene quite far removed from what we had in our heads.

I mean, it wasn’t that we hated the look
Masala Dosa....Awesome!
of here or that this was even a bad place. It just wasn’t quite what we had envisioned, as this was apparently a popular honeymooners destination? Add this to the fairly miserable weather, I think this dampened our spirits a little.

So after a little self-pity from us both and a metaphorical slap round the chops, we stopped sulking and went straight down to the vegetarian restaurant in our hotel and ordered our first Dosa (these would feature quite heavily in the days to come…..yummy!)

After a few days here walking around the streets and seeing the local sights, we really started to appreciate this little place high in the hills. It was a far cry from the bustling streets of Chennai, and since being here, with the exception of a couple of drivers, we barley had anyone to fight off.

Had the weather treated us a little better, we would have been able to enjoy the views of the valley which is a major pull for coming here in the first place, however it just wasn’t to be for us this time. We did see a little decent weather here and there, but, it was also
Cloudy views
cloudy and therefore even rather cold at times being so high up. This could have lured us both into another sulk, however the fact that all the local men were donning those ridiculous tiger print earmuffs helped us keep a smile on our face throughout…

Our time here in Kodaikanal was actually a nice little detour away from the cities and I think overall, we were both actually quite glad we made the effort to come. We certainly didn’t do much here other than take a few walks, hang-out in a couple of the nice cafes they have and eat some amazing vegetarian food, but that suited us just fine for now.

Our next stop would be Mysore, and again, we would have to take the overnight sleeper in order to reach our destination. A hassle we could probably do without, however Mysore is one of the major Yogi areas in India, so we felt however bad the trip was, we could always distress with a little Yoga...

Dreary view from the window
'Welcome to the Jungle' - Guns 'N' Roses



So, Incredible India.....

We arrived in the dark at Chennai airport, so it would be hard to see what India looked like in the flesh just yet. 5 minutes into our journey from the airport to our pre-booked hotel however and already it was starting to look we were in for one hell of a ride........What we saw when we first arrived here certainly was Incredible!

It would of course be stupid, ignorant and harsh to judge somewhere in that amount of time, but wow….. straight away, we knew this was something else.

I don’t think I have ever in my life seen so many cars, Tuk Tuk’s motorbikes, trucks and Lorries on one 2 lane road. It was unbelievable. The lane separator painted on the road was an absolute waste of the council’s time and money as everyone acted as if it was mere decoration rather than actually having a purpose. On these roads, there are literally no rules, and a crash seems to be inevitable at any moment. Amongst all this, some deluded and crazy people even dared to ride their push bikes
Our friendly doorman
in the middle of these manic roads. People I can only assume have had enough of this life and are ready to move onto the next.

Our time in Chennai was a bit lacklustre to say the least. To be honest, this wasn’t necessarily due to the city itself as we could only muster the will to get out of the hotel once a day to either buy essentials or book train tickets etc. However when all the outdoor world brought us in those first few days was leering men, horn honking, Tuk tuk drivers asking us ‘where we were going? - and where the only local sites were ones of construction (the whole of Chennai seemed to be one big construction site in progress) and where the streets are hard to walk along due to the amount of rubbish blocking the way, I think we can be forgiven for our laziness. Would this be a sign of things to come? We hoped not.

Before we had arrived in India, we had done the usual and booked ourselves into a ‘fairly decent’ Hotel for a few nights so we could get our bearings. This is a standard measure
These guys were relentless!
we always take after flights to a new country mainly because it’s easier to have accommodation set up for us already and when taxi or Tuk tuk drivers try to take you to their ‘friends’ hotel in exchange for some cheeky commission, we can avoid this tedious to & throw and go straight to where we actually wanted to go. The other reason, if we are honest, is that we like to treat ourselves to a nice hotel now and again since travelling usually means staying in some dives from time to time, and this often seems the best time to do that!

Sadly for us, the pictures and the price we paid didn’t really live up to what we were expecting of our hotel and so we ended up in a pretty depressing room, unable to face the streets of Chennai for a full three days before we could get out of this polluted, bustling city. On a good note however, the food in the hotel was incredible, and they did have a bar serving unlimited snacks with each beer purchase. The down side to this was the place was lit like an opium den and there wasn’t
A position I would adopt for most of our stay here
a single woman in there in all the times we went in, which didn’t make for the most comfortable experience for Donna, however the cold beer, free snacks and not having to venture outside, meant that we this was probably the most agreeable scenario we were likely to encounter here. So down to the 70mm we went!

I not really sure what happened to us in Chennai really, but we just wasn’t really feeling up to taking to the streets nor did we have the willingness to even try and explore the place. This is pretty bad on our part, and we are not normally this type of traveller as we usually find the positives in most places we visit no matter how small they may be.

So, anyway, we decided our next stop should be somewhere a little less frantic, and so after a flick through the guide book, we decided to head to the Western Ghats, and to a town called Kodaikanal. In order to get to Kodai, it would mean taking an 8 hour overnight train, so we booked our tickets and walked the short distance over the road from our hotel to the train
Train Carriage or Prison cell...
station. Our tickets for the train were in the sleeper class, which at least meant we would get some kind of bed. After boarding the train, we found our seats and looked over our ‘beds’ for the night. To be honest, I think we were both actually picturing worse however this didn’t stop the place looking like some form of prison carriage used to ferry convicts about the country. Not long after we pulled away though, we were relieved that the carriage was fairly empty as fully booked, the area we were in (about 10ft by 6ft) was supposed to house 8 people.

Once the craziness of everyone loading up their luggage and faffing around had ceased, we sat back, opened a packet of Lemon Puff biscuits and soaked up the breeze from the open window and enjoyed the scenery as we headed Westbound out of Chennai. It was actually very relaxing, and we found ourselves chilling out for the first time since our arrival.

When it came to sleeping, the only things that stopped us getting our full 40 winks was an annoying family and their stroppy pre-teen kid, along with the constant shouting from hawkers at
Bunks down and time for sleep
each of our stops. To be honest, after a while, it didn’t really bother us, and we would chalk this one down as a fairly uneventful, easy journey.

my first trip to Chennai was after the disastrous event at Bangalore and I arrived by an early morning flight and left for the guest house only to be told that I had been shifted to another guest house and of course because of the event the previous day I hadn't checked my mails so words were exchanged with travel desk but it didn't make much difference. In India we have a saying "" Whatever Happens happens for the best"" I'm not sure if it originated in India but we do believe in it a lot. the next guest house was this amazing house somewhere in the best locality in Chennai maybe altamount Road and it was beautiful. It was meant for the likes of the Chairman of the Company and here I was an assistant manager staying in it.

I left for the Park where the event was supposed to take place and our models had come from Bangalore along with the event organisers. The event was going well in a candle lit bar at the Park when all hell broke loose during the press briefing and shoot with the division manager screaming her head off. My boss left in a huff and puff, crying all the way and it was such a dampener. The guests, models and press were stunned and there was a major row with the hotel staff and blah blah let's just forget about it all. I returned to my lovely room filled with the most ornate wooden furniture and slumped into a tired stupor only to wake the next morning and leave on an early morning flight for Kolkata.

the next time we went to Chennai was in 2010 when hubby was going there for an interview. my dad would armour us with a few vouchers from Taj and we booked ourselves at the Taj, Mount Road and by eight in the morning had reached Chennai from Bangalore and were on our way to the hotel. We used one of the vouchers to upgrade ourselves and got an executive room instead. After room service and lunch we hired a cab to take us around the city and drove to the station, the High Court, Kapaleswar temple and Marina Beach. The Beach is beautiful and enjoys a vast coastline, we stood amongst the waves and saw fish being cooked on open fires. We also went to the Eliot beach and had a fishy dinner at a local restaurant there. The next day we had breakfast and hubby left for his interview. I worked out at the gym and he returned while I was in the middle of my workout. We ordered room service of kebabs and rasamalai.

In the evening I convinced my hubby to go out for a walk and we walked to a nearby shopping mall but it was crowded and humid, so we walked back and went up to the rooftop swimming pool and sat there for sometime. This was in November and hence it wasn't as hot as Chennai can get. After sometime we left for the airport and were happy to have enjoyed our short and sweet trip to Chennai.

P1080102
Day 214 (Tues 9thApril)



I had a 6am start this morning, well a 5am wakeup call. I got picked up by a tuk tuk and taken to a hostel where a mini bus turned up soon after to take us to the border. This took around 3 hours, the border crossing being a lot more speedy than the reverse trip last Tuesday. I was approached by a bloke offering a minibus to Bangkok, after chatting for a minute or 2 decided to go with him as even though it was a little more expensive than the bus I was told it was straight through, with no messing about and a drop off point. Quite often this is all lies to get business but for once I went with it and all worked out fine. I was back in Bangkok and at my hostel by 2pm which was perfect, giving me a break for 2 hours before heading back out.

Around half past 3 I got the light rail to the north of the city. I then hopped on a shuttle bus when I found it to a place called the Impact Centre, a huge shopping complex that
P1080102
is on the outskirts of the city. Here I met a friend of my Dad’s who was in town. He had told me about football that was on that night so never one to miss an opportunity to watch sports headed out. We grabbed some food in the Irish bar and then walked around the corner to the match.

The match itself was of reasonable quality. It was an Asian Champions league game between Muangthong United of Thailand and Guangzhou Everglade of China. The home crowd sung throughout even whilst getting a hammering. The game ended 4-1 to the Chinese. Muangthong are the ‘Manchester United’ of Thai football, won the title the previous few seasons and have all the money, they also attempt to be the same in every aspect from colour of shirts, to songs and also team nickname. They however are not anywhere near as good.

We headed back into town after this to have a drink, we took a quick walk through Soi Cowboy, an area of Bangkok maybe 100 metres long with numerous bars on each side, there must be 40 or 50 easy. Each one has Texan Cowboy style girls outside offering the
P1080103
usual things they do here. They aren’t too annoying like they can be in other places which makes the walk through not too painful. We had a drink in a British pub around the corner and then I headed back to my hostel.



Day 215 (Wed 10th April)



First thing this morning I headed back to the VFS Indian Visa office to re-submit my passport. As I took it with me last week to go back to Cambodia I had to obviously hand it back in again for my visa to be granted. After this I went back to the hostel and got back into bed. I had no plans so figured I might as well.

I woke up maybe 3 hours later not feeling very well. I had a banging headache as well as starting to suffer from a fever. I was going from hot to cold very quickly and it was doing my head in. With no plans I decided more bed was in order. I popped over to the 7/11 to get some paracetamol to cure my head but this failed miserably.

I did nothing with the rest of
P1080104
the day except to try and get better, this however did not happen.



Days 216 – 218 (Thurs 11th – Sat 13th April)



The past 3 days I have summed up into one report as I’ve done pretty much nothing. I went into the visa office on Thursday afternoon still feeling like death and after being caught in a mental thunderstorm wasn’t feeling any better about things. I was told my passport had not been delivered as it was raining which is a belter of an excuse. I managed to get there so there is no reason someone in a car or mototaxi delivering the passports couldn’t. I went back to the hostel to resume my meeting with my bed. I took more pain killers but these were starting to have further affects being upsetting my stomach, my back and neck were also starting to ache at this point.

On Friday I got my passport back, visa all sorted at last and I went back to hostel to relax for a couple hours. Early afternoon I met up with my mate Greg, a lad who now works in Bangkok but I went to
P1080236
high school with. I haven’t seen him since maybe 2005 since school so was good to have a catch up. We grabbed some lunch and spent the afternoon wandering around a number of Bangkok’s malls as they have air con and it was really hot out. My fever and headache’s had pretty much subsided by now but my neck was so stiff I couldn’t turn it and my back very nearly collapsed on a visit to the bathroom. My body felt completely broken. It’s pretty lucky I was on a lazy week as if I had things to do I’d have been in serious problems. Myself and Greg spent around 5 hours catching up and then I headed back to the hostel covered in tiger balm to try and relieve my neck pain.

I woke up on Saturday feeling better, my neck and back were improved although still sore but I was feeling far better about things. I was online chatting to my mate Dave, who I’ve templed visited and drank heavily with in Siem Reap in mid March online and we were both in Bangkok so decided to meet up. We picked a MRT station and a time.
P1080211
I headed there at the time and so did Dave but somewhere along the lines we obviously ended up waiting in different places, both assuming the place we were was the correct one. After an hour passed I headed back to the hostel. It was quite annoying that we never got the chance to meet up as we had a good time in Cambodia together, but I was in no state for a session and I know that’s what Dave ended up having, so I avoided having the temptation. I spent the evening in my hostel to avoid Songkran going on in the streets.

Songkran is the massive water fight that happens in Thailand around the 13th/14th and following days every year to celebrate in the New Year. This is normally something I’d be up for although it does seem a bit of a daft event. After one bucket of water one is wet so after that one can’t get wetter so heads home and gets changed. At least in India at something like Holi and the coloured flour they get covered in you can change colour throughout the day etc and seems more interesting to me. Having been
P1080215
ill I decided it was a decent idea to stay clear of this so stayed indoors. I spent the evening watching Liverpool on the tv so once I was bored stupid I headed to bed.



Day 219 (Sun 14th April)



I lingered around the hostel today after doing a bit of shopping for a few pieces I needed. I then followed the formula 1 on the computer before heading out to Don Mueang Airport. I was to fly to Chennai in India, formally Madras. Check in was amusing, mainly for the fact that I reckon every other Indian person checking in was also checking in a 40 inch minimum flat screen tv. Now I have no idea what was going on here, why this was happening but I imagine the guys loading the stuff onto the plane thought they were working for Samsung. This seemed very odd to me.

The flight was fine and then I arrived. I realised on the plane that I had no money in my account and needed to get online to transfer some. On arrival in Chennai I then found out nowhere had wifi. This was a problem,
P1080218
I managed to get a price for a taxi and off we went. I got him to stop at an ATM to have a look at my account. I had just enough to cover a taxi and my room for the night luckily, so I could get online and transfer some money. The hotel was pretty horrible and the room wasn’t ready, this being 11pm at night, also 2 doors down there were 8 men in a room having a curry sleepover it seemed, there were also various old gentlemen walking around in just towels. I soon got into my room and locked the door and went to sleep, I wanted out soon as possible.



Day 220 (Mon 15th April)



I woke up and checked out, headed to the bus stop I was told to. The bus turned up, I asked the driver if it was the right one, he shook his head and drove off, whilst another passenger waved at me to say no, go away. Hello India. I was not feeling it at all. I headed back to the hotel and asked them to book me a taxi, he quoted me a
P1080222
price, way more than it should be but I said ok and sat down. 30 mins later I was getting fed up, I asked again and was told they didn’t order it because they thought I wasn’t going to pay it. The place was run by complete idiots. The guy arrived in a string vest to drive me into town, he spoke no English but tried anyways, which just frustrated me. We got there in the end after asking at least 5 people for directions and I checked in. My new room was actually worse than the last one, my bed also being maybe 5 foot 6 inches max so my feet would have to be off the side, great!

I was in close proximity to the Chennai cricket ground which is my sole reason for being in India, the follow the IPL for a month or so, I have no other interest in India apart from to see the Taj Mahal and eat the food. I headed off to the ground to buy a ticket for tonights game. I asked the security guards where I could get one from, they said maybe gate 3. I started walking that
P1080241
direction.

A guy on a motorbike (Johnson, I struggle to believe that’s his real name) pulled up and stopped me, asking if I worked for Chennai Super Kings (CSK). Maybe it was because I was in all sports wear and being white he must of thought I was part of the staff. Obviously this is not the case and I told him that, I said I was after a ticket. He made a couple calls which looked promising then it fell through. I told him they’d said gate 3 to me so I hopped on his bike and he drove me round, I bought my ticket and that was sorted. He then took me for a spin along the promenade of the beach, this apparently being the longest/biggest beach in the world. From the promenade to the sea is easily over 100 metres, huge beach. He was off to the cinema and I wanted food so we went to the mall and I got my first Indian food, chicken biryani with rice, side serving of more chicken, other bits and a drink, 200 rupees (£2.50) an absolute bargain. He then guided me the way back to my hotel. I
P1080245
went back got changed and headed to the match. Johnson was a class act, we sat down whilst I ate and had a chat etc. He gave me his number so if I can be bothered to get a sim card will get in touch, the likelihood of me paying for a sim card to do that are not so high though. Maybe I’ll bump into him at the cricket.

The match was good and the atmosphere unreal. It was sit where you like so plenty of people moved about. One guy sat in front of me at one point was dancing bollywood style every single ball, if a boundary was scored he was on the chairs giving it absolute beans. I’ve not seen that at home before and I spent most the match laughing away. The fans are brilliant, it certainly adds something to the game.

After this I wandered back to my hotel past many many cows and people asleep in the middle of roads, and these are busy roads, with people lying asleep on the sides of them, while a cow eats away at what little belongings they have left. It’s a weird set up here. The place is very dirty and very poor. I am hoping all of India isn’t as depressing as here, otherwise it’ll be a long month. Off to Bangalore for some more cricket tomorrow.

Primeiro estranha-se, depois entranha-se.

As cidades ruidosas, sujas, aparentemente desorganizadas. Mas sob o caos tantas formas de vida! As peles escuras, as cores dos tecidos, tudo atirado ou pendurado no meio da rua, um senhor passa a ferro a carvao no meio do passeio, outro agachado conserta calcado com agulha em cima de uma pedra, os cegos, os aleijados, o muculmano de ar grave com a barba a emoldurar o queixo, os jovens de ""saia"" ( Doti) comprida ou dobrada acima do joelho, o tasco de fritos e chai quente e aromatico, com os homens agrupados no passeio a segurar o copo quente de vidro entre o polegar e o medio, sorvendo goles curtos e olhando o movimento, as velhas enfeitadas com as banhas a sair do sari, as meninas perfumadas com flores brancas de jasmim fresco no cabelo, o universitario de oculos e camisinha aos quadrados, os meninos e as meninas a regressar da escola em bando de uniforme, descalcos ou de chinelo, em grande cavaqueira; os hijras (nem homem nem mulher) a requebrar a anca, a bater palmas a pedir (como quem manda!) esmola aos comerciantes; velhos da idade da minha avo sentados ou a dormir na pedra do chao, homens santos de cajado, mulheres a carregar pesados fardos de brita num estaleiro, o inistente condutor de rickshaw (Hello rickshaw?) de camisa beige, os bigodes pretos de varios feitios, as motos com familias inteiras em cima, um monte redondo e verde de cocos no passeio, uma catana, e o vendedor acocorado a ler o jornal; as buzinas (guincho, ronco, musical, grito, nariz de palhaco...varios sons).

Mistura viva de uma grande diversidade que fala, mais ruidosa que mil buzinas e tuc-tucs, mais picante que um caril, mais colorida e entrelacada que as voltas de um sari, mais cheirosa que o lixo fetido das ruas ou que sandalo ou canela. O que vi foi a Terra a gritar. Os aleijados, as criancas, os agricultores nos arrozais, os pequenos negocios, os templos, os animais na selva, a agua das moncoes o repique excitado da tabla - talvez a terra mais densamente povoada e mais diversa do planeta a gritar - VIDA!

Parto ja com saudades, depois de devorar varios tipos caril ao pequeno almoco e deixar, humilhada no prato, uma tosta branca com manteiga.

After nearly a month I am convinced of one thing. This country is bananas. Within the space of 10 minutes you can run through a series of emotions along the lines of extreme confusion, hysterical laughter, ‘get me on the next plane’, desire to punch someone in the face and ‘I am never leaving’. I am strongly considering having a t-shirt made emblazoned with the following phrases that seem to be all that is required for general conversation:

Jenny.

I am fine.

England.

And on the back, simply:

No.

That is no to rickshaw after just getting out of a rickshaw, no to hotel after have just walked out of the entrance to hotel where am clearly staying, no to a picture with creepy Indian man. Endless uses.

In other news we are very settled into our Ashwini life. It is amazing how quickly things which at first seem totally alien become routine-I daily have to remind myself that showering with a bucket whilst staring at mountains with a soundtrack of drums and prayer calls is not normal! Having said that have still not fully adjusted to the happy family of cockroaches living in the fridge…We also took issue with the toddler-sized dead rat directly in front of the hospital which we pointed out might be slightly off-putting to patients. This was followed by a passionate debate in our house about what to do with said rat. UK suggestion: throw it into the forest where it can rot away/be eaten. US suggestion: douse with alcohol, set alight where it is, if the bones aren’t burnt to ash crush them by hand. Indian suggestion: put in ‘incinerator’ which is actually oven owned by Irish doctor. UK suggestion wins. Go figure.

We are still seeing some incredibly weird and wonderful medicine including a man who was wheeled in totally unresponsive, head flopping all over the show, after a huge night of drinking. We thought he was done for. Nandekumar casually finished his consultation and wandered over. He was convinced the problem was low glucose but naturally the machine to test this was out of battery so he just went with his gut and gave him some IV dextrose (basically sugar in vein) and it was genuinely like he had risen from the dead. Within about 3 seconds. Was incredible.

It hasn’t all been miracles unfortunately. The most difficult thing we have found is watching people undergo procedures which without question would be done under general anaesthetic in the UK-this is just not an option here as they don’t have a resident anaesthetist or the resources. We saw a man with awful 2nd degree burns to his leg from a kerosene lamp who needed the necrotic, infected skin removed. I shall spare you all the details but let’s just say if certain patients within the NHS saw what he went through they might think twice before moaning …

Han and I are doing a project suggested by Shyla looking into why tribal women have their contraceptive coils removed prematurely. The general conclusion seems to be that they take them out when they want another child (pretty reasonable really) but it has been so interesting to speak to the women about this subject which still a huge taboo. Basically the tribal women tend to be aware of three types of contraception: staying away from their men, the copper coil and sterilisation. None that we have spoken to have ever had any formal sex-ed, reproductive health or contraceptive education other than opportunistically when they happen to come to hospital or what their mothers tell them. We are going to try and convince Ashwini a bit more sexy health teaching might be a good plan!

Life outside the hospital has been pretty idyllic. For our first weekend we decided to stay close by to make the most of our pretty stunning mountainous backyard. Well fuelled from our cooking lesson with Shyla (I say lesson-we chopped some onions and a few tomatoes which she somehow then morphed into three separate but equally beautiful dishes within the space of about half an hour) we headed off for what was intended to be a good day’s hike. Armed with an impressively accurate hand-drawn map from Shyla we headed, as instructed, ‘past the thatched huts, right of the buffalo pen (containing 0 buffalo), keep the water tower on left, find path through dense forest, turn left and if you get lost, which is likely, ask for cinema shooting point’. We reached the final stages after about 20 minutes (think we have slightly differing opinions as to what constitutes a ‘trek’) so decided to venture a bit further into the forest and stumbled across a pretty magical clearing overlooking the valley with dozens of white butterflies flittering around where we spent most of the afternoon making the most of no-one else being around to expose our shoulders and, shocking I know, even a touch of knee.

Last week the wonderful Mahesh-an Ayurvedic (the branch of Indian medicine which focuses on natural remedies etc) doctor took us on a school trip to Ashwini’s Tea Estate where we very trustingly smelled, poked and ate various plants. Our favourite is a small fern-like leaf called ‘touch me not’ which angrily curls up if you brush against it. We received a lesson in exotic fruit picking: for a mango all you need is a big stick and good aim whereas guavas require a tree climb and shake. The highlight of the day came as we reached the waterfall at the bottom of the valley where we swam (fully clothed, woe betide any knee flashing), tried our hand-picked park shampoo and munched our chapattis. Paradise. We also had a very brief attempt at tea picking (I was sacked by my woman after approximately 45 seconds for my inefficiency). It is no easy task-they work 12 months a year regardless of heat/monsoon and earn 180 rupees (just over £2) for an 8 hour day, providing they pick at least 30 kilos of tea which is carried in a huge sack attached to a band around the forehead. My new appreciation for Tetley’s was cemented by a visit to the tea factory where, in a bizarre attempt to be an ‘attraction’, they have strewn various model animals around the entrance including a dinosaur, possessed-looking giraffe and-a natural choice in country with an average temperature of about 35 degrees- a penguin. Tea making is a hefty business involving multiple rollings, grindings, fermentings and sorting. Workers sweating away are however reassuringly informed by a sign on the wall that ‘God is pleased to have put you in this position’. Sure they are delighted by this news.

We were somehow engaged in 6.30am football sessions with some of the local boys. Which are complicated slightly by a goal-post eating dog. My contributions I have to admit were pretty limited to running at people screaming rather than any actual skill but felt pretty wholesome all the same.

We have also visited the local national park through which runs one of the main roads- people speeding past elephants on motorbikes is quite a sight! We took a trip on the safari-bus and saw more elephants (some not even chained to the trees), peacocks, bison, deer and a giant squirrel which are possibly the cutest animals of all time. We also went to elephant feeding where we were as much of an attraction as the animals. Though have to say we have all also fallen into the habit of staring at any white people we see-they are quite a rarity!

Finally (and arguably most importantly) we have made some excellent new food discoveries the highlights of which are egg curry, coconut pumpkin, an apple shaped marzipan-like sweet and, our newest treasure, Special Avil Milk. It is hard to express in words the wonder of this concoction but I will try: layer of banana, then grape and other various fruits, followed by nuts and topped with a muesli style grain and all packed out with ice-cream. Not sure exactly what avil, or in fact milk, have to do with it but it is epic. I shall try an recreate it on return. It has to be tasted to be believed.

We are spending our first placement with an organisation called Ashwini, an organisation developed over 20 years ago essentially to provide healthcare and community development for the 25000+ members of the 5 local tribes. The hospital is now almost entirely managed and run by tribal workers, as are their 8 area centres. In short it is everything an NGO should be-there is a huge focus on ownership by the local population which makes it as sustainable as possible. The hospital is small but well equipped (and being expanded as we speak by the most efficient group of builders I have ever seen in my life. A large majority of which are women. Though their wooden scaffolding held together with rope does look slightly death-inducing). Extension will be much appreciated by the staff as currently the operating department is in X-ray and the labour ward is in medical records! <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />It is brilliantly run though very different from the UK. Confidentiality is not really a concept-people just wander in and out of consultations as they feel like it. They are also far more free and easy with their sedating drugs and the hand hygiene nurses would have a field day. The 6 of us sit in a line in clinic and take it in turns to variously prod patients-not at all intimidating! However the positives far outweigh the negatives-the patients clearly love the staff, the services they offer are incredibly efficient and I like how the family are always around to care for their ill relatives-they care for them, change the sheets, keep them company. It is a lovely atmosphere.<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />In our first outpatient week (sorry non-medics!) I saw more than I have in months at a UK hospital including acute Gullain-Barre, sickle cell crises, hookworm, previously undiagnosed Grave's disease, lots of TB and more signs than you could shake a DOSCE list at. That plus 99% of the patients have diabetes. Which is not a surprise as they put sugar in EVERYTHING. Cat literally could chew the sugar lumps in her banana shake earlier this week. Everyone seems outraged when we ask for all of our drinks without. Very bizarre.<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />The hospital is in the most stunning location in the Nilgiri hills-a sort of Indian lake district without the lakes-surrounded by tea plantations and farms growing all sorts of exotic crops we are gradually learning the names of. And probably eating. Hard to tell. We can watch the sun set over the mountains from our porch. It is just beautiful. There is also a small town called Gudalur about a ten minute walk away which is not so similar to the Lakes-very much India!-but has everything we need including fruit to balance out our 90% carbtastic diet!<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />The hospital was largely set up by possibly the most inspirational couple I have ever met-surgeon Nandekumar and his gynaecologist wife Shyla. They trained the nurses 'as mini doctors’ as that is what they knew-when other nurses first visited they were outraged that they could prescribe but not make the beds! They did their specialist training in the US, living in the same neighbourhood as the Rockefellers (as in of the Centre fame) with the full intention of moving back to India to work somewhere where they would be able to give back to the community. They chose Ashwini and have made their life here because they believe so completely in the project and also because they have so much input into the system-as Nandekumar says better to be the head of a fox than they tail of a lion. They have built the most beautiful house about 2 minutes from the hospital. I want to live in it. Shyla is teaching us to cook so expect lots of delights on my return! <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We are staying in a lovely little guesthouse about 50 metres from the hospital which is rather handy. We have a cook called Mala who I genuinely think is fattening us up for the eating. Though have just found the fridge’s resident cockroaches so perhaps that will stem my obesity! Getting pretty nifty with the bucket shower again too. There are 5 of us from Bristol, a medic from Leicester called Ali who fits in brilliantly as she is also crackers and a couple of other people who work nearby, including a doctor called Viveck (spelling debateable) who we have tasked with teaching us Tamil. This so far consists of watching a non-subtitled Tamil film about a killer elephant. Not so convinced about the effectiveness of this strategy. <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />On the subject of elephants had no idea how much of a menace they are. We visited one of the tribal villages where they have had to move houses and people seem to get trampled (or ‘chapattified’ as Nandekumar would say) on a semi-regular basis. We walked out to one of the families deeper in the forest who have only a thatched roof but no walls and are (understandably) worried as an elephant comes close to their house every night. At one point we walked past a group of pretty excitable dogs (becoming increasingly grateful I took the rabies jab hit!) and were told to walk quicker as ‘the barking irritates the elephants and they come and chase them away’ at which point I asked, mildly concerned, if we were going to be trampled by an elephant at some point that day to which our Ashwini accompanier, the wonderful Mahantu, comfortingly replied after some consideration ‘probably not’. Found out earlier in the trip I can buy a baby elephant for 1 million rupees (about £12,500). Swiftly going off that idea!!<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We really did not appreciate the extent of the wildlife here. Which is pretty thick as we are on the edge of a national park. So far-and the list is growing by the day-we have been told about the leopards (which ate Shyla’s dog), Cobras (for which there is no venom antidote), tigers (they will gnaw your head), wild boars (who will gore you with their huge teeth and are known to chase the odd medical student) and, last but not least, giant wild squirrels (which as far as I know have no massive risk though chances are they have some kind of sword in their tails). Makes the cockroaches look like kittens! Shyla ans Nadekumar also own the biggest turkey I have ever seen in my life. It is about the size of a shed. Might take it round with me on a lead to fight off the leopards etc.<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />Life outside the hospital is all very tranquil-lots of chatting (more often than not about bowels), book reading and mango shakes. We went to a wedding of one of the nurses in the hospital today. Well, I say we went to the wedding. We turned up, were served enough rice and curry to feed a small country followed by coconut milk rice pudding (epic), had many photos taken of us-seriously starting to feel like a celebrity, have perfected my royal wave-and then left. No messing. The lack of alcohol results in a pretty civilised day!<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We are having a party in our house tonight (obviously entirely civilised) as Ali gets her Finals results. So far there is the 6 of us and 2 other guests. Think we need to make some more friends pretty quickly…

Where to start. The food. Ahh the food. Definitely the highlight of the trip so far. It is out of this world-we are all definitely going to be very chapatti-fatty when we return. Getting very into curry for breakfast and perfecting the art of eating with no hands-is all in the thumb flick.<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />Now to the country. India is the biggest contrast of a country I have ever experienced-it is hot, busy, crowded, dirty, stressful and frustrating. However it is also friendly, diverse, interesting and in many places, properly beautiful. And not sure if I have mentioned the food…? I feel like I have already learnt and seen so much and we haven't even been here two weeks. My brain is going to explode by the time I return!<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We started out trip with a week bumbling around Kerala, one of the Southern Indian states which is pretty progressive compared to others in terms of infrastructure and education. After saying farewell to the Heathrow snow we had an uneventful journey (sitting down after the moving out experience was very welcome!) to Delhi. Where we became quickly very grateful for our three hour stopover as the bus ride was our terminal was basically on the other side of India. Luckily our pathetic faces got us a free ride as we did not yet have any money! We pretty quickly got hold of some though as we needed to buy a print out of our flight details before they would even let us in the terminal. After much faff we finally landed in Trivandrum. This is the state capital of Kerala and is, as far as we can tell, a typical Indian city. Cars, buses, people, goats, bikes, shops and tuktuks all jostle for space in a very dusty road with an indeterminate number of lanes. Many of the stalls line a small river which is quite simply full of the city’s rubbish which also collects in heaps at the end of most roads. It is such a shame as a lot of the buildings and streets are otherwise lovely. At the station we found the most incredible list of concessions I have ever seen-including 'girl scouts in uniform’, ‘bona-fide circus artists travelling in parties no less than three’, ‘dead bodies’ and ‘orthopaedically handicapped or paraplegic without an escort’. <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />The following day we took the train to Varkala Beach-we did not at this point realise we can get into any carriage with our ticket so simply got into the standard second class carriage much to the amusement of the locals, many of whom were nearly decapitated with our various bags. Was also given the helpful piece of advice that the reason I am not yet married is because ‘I am not trying hard enough’. Good to know. The beach is simply paradise-lined by red cliffs (naturally dusted = with a healthy sprinkling of rubbish), white sand, bamboo huts (complete with resident frog), very chilled cafes and restaurants along the cliff top path. A world away from the city experience! We spent a couple of days just battery recharging, saintly resisting alcohol, eating some incredible muesli and achieving some (look away now mother) rather impressively patchy sunburning-which now looks like I have some kind of skin disease as I decided to only apply my aftersun to the patchy areas so I didn’t waste it. Was only after about a week I figured out it is a self-tanning/aftersun combo. I blame the heat-brain. <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />Anyway, next we headed to Aleppey, the apparent ‘Venice of India’. Rather exciting experience as the train started moving with Emilie still on the platform. Luckily the woman behind was VERY keen to get on so gave her a good shove. Think Venice is a minor stretch of the imagination but away from the main street it is very leafy with canals filled variously with water, sludge and forest. This is a far more touristy zone-every step is soundtracked with one repeating loop of ‘you want hotel? Houseboat? Taxi? Dinner?’ And my personal favourite, ‘yes?’. You can imagine my imaginative reply. We ducked off the street into a local restaurant for some peace and a fan and decided to try some new things. Word to the wise-salted lime soda is a no-go. <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We spent the following day and night on a houseboat which meanders down the Keralan backwaters past villages that live off and within the river-washing clothes, fishing, chatting. Would be slightly more authentic if it weren’t for the gazillion other boats but is still very tranquil as we have a boat and personal chef to ourselves. All for the grand price of £30! <br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />After defrosting from the arctic-temperature-only air conditioning we reluctantly returned to dry land the next morning and, after a ride in the tuktuk of the Worst Driver in the History of Time ™ (seriously, not convinced he was actually not entirely blind) we miraculously made it to the station to get a train to Cochin, which we loved. We stayed in Fort Cochin which is the older part of town-a medley of British, Portugese and Indian architecture and churches. After an authentic Indian Thali meal (grand price of 30p for all you can eat mystery delicious items) we sat by the lake watching sunset over fishermen reeling in their Chinese Fishing Nets-huge crescent shaped nets attached to wooden structures and pulleys. Is absolutely gorgeous. Stayed in a guesthouse with a very friendly manager who seemed to take a bit of a liking to me. After memorising my name ‘from the passport-hello Jennifer Mary Dodds’-offered everything from bananas to whisky to use of his toilet just as we were about to leave, followed by a rather distressed hug. Fell hard and fast that one.<br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" /><br style=""color:� font-family: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; font-size: 13px; line-height: 15px;"" />We treated ourselves to an AMAZING breakfast in an art gallery for our last day of travel pre-placement-doorstep toast, honey, masses of fruit and ‘breakfast cake’ which I will definitely be trying to recreate. The 6 hour journey to Ashwini was pretty luxurious in our chauffeured car, though mildly terror inducing as we wound up the very hairpin bends in the dark (still not convinced by either Indian road safety or simply awareness that there are other vehicles on the road)! We made it in one piece and I am so glad-this place is incredible.

Pictures from the Nilgiri Hills and Ooty. My camera wasn't working, so I didn't take as many as I would have liked.

It was nice to be in the mountains. The air felt lighter. It felt good to breath in the cool air.

This post is a small rewind about my trip to kodai with office friends. It’s a long plan & fixed well before 2 months. I made all the arrangements from booking the cab, Lodge, Dance & dinner… So its a most memorable one.

Travellers: Krishnakumar, Raghu, Praveen, Santhosh, Kishore, Samuel, Suresh, Malairajan, Kumaravel.



I went to Madurai 2 days before our trip, as for my personal work in my native. Bought all the snacks (Tirunelweli Alwa, mixture, Athirasam, murukku, bovonto, cakes….) from Madurai & my mom prepared Lemon rice, Puliyotharai & the side dish needed. Dad helped me a lot for this trip. (A special thanks for him).

<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"">Day 1: (18- Mar 2011 – Friday)

From Vadipatti, i took the cab (TATA SUMO) & reached Bathlagundu. Others came from Chennai by SETC ultra deluxe bus. As you know the condition, speed of the UD buses here, the boys are very tired after 12 hours long journey & it came very late (as-usual).

We all met at Bathlagundu nearly @ 6 AM, had a nice tea @ Ayyangar’s bakery (best tea shop, bigger one, opened near-by the busstand). Bought some Fragrance sticks (Oothu bathi) for the cab. The journey started in next half an hour through the misty mountains. On the way we took some photos & reached Kodai around 8:45 AM. After refresh in our hotel, had Bread & jam as breakfast. I finished first (sollava venum) & In the mean time, me & our driver (Chellappa – my dad’s friend) went to book the reservation for Berijam lake visit. Actually the entrance is restricted, as it is in reserved forest, we need to get prior permission from Forest department of Tamilnadu. The Permission is restricted to max of 10 -20 vehicles per day, so the demand is more on weekends. We applied for it & got the permission in noon. So we decided to go for Space observatory. Around 10:15 AM, we went there. (It opens to public only on Friday 10 AM – 12 PM). It’s really a superb observatory, many of the tourist doesn’t know about it & they doesn’t have the chance to visit it. We were so lucky.



From there, we moved to Berijam Lake. it’s a 22 KMs journey inside the thick forest. The path to this lake & the places around this lake are so enchanting. We took more snaps all the way to this lake. There is no trace for human habitat, Not even a mobile signal. The green trees, misty path, chill breeze, made us the heavenly feel .Roamed around the lake & had a nice Lunch nearby the lake, a small jolt, few photos, saw black squirrels….; Spent nearly 1 hour there after the sumptuous meal.

Returned to Chettiar park around 4 PM to take some rest. This park is just a lonely garden. Many of the flowers were newly planted & it’s a developing one. Lot of clicks from our cameras prove that this park will become a centre of attraction. The way to this park is little narrow & all the kudos goes for our driver.



Went to Kurinchi Andavar temple around 5PM & saw the Palani valley view, had masala tea, kadalai in the nearby shops. After half an hour, went to J’s Heritage to confirm our dinner the next day. We booked for a dance, dinner & camp-fire. As all were tired from a long journey & we returned to the hotel. The climate made us to sleep early. I took a bath in the cold water without any hesitation & went for a sound sleep.

<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"">Day 2: (19- Mar 2011 – Saturday)

We’re there for sunrise @ 6 AM. Enjoyed the hot tea & vadai @ Munjikal (Sponsored by Raghu machan). After refresh, had Breakfast @ Ayyappa mess @ Munjikal. This small hotel was run by a mad man, who cracked all jokes, the best of all is cheapest breakfast.

Went to Coaker’s walk (To purchase rings – that’s what we did there) around 9AM. The mist came all along the way from valley & swept us like a cool breeze. Spent some time, took snaps, then moved to Fairy falls view (Photo session). We had a nice Trekking to Dolphin’s nose around 1 PM. The trek is most enjoyed by all of us & it had everything for a small picnic. We sat at the tip of Dolphin’s nose shaped rock & took photos.



With Glucose energy we returned form there. The stomach alarmed us & after 2 PM we finished our Lunch on the way. Mom’s preparation is really awesome, the remaining items are given to monkeys as per our driver’s wish.

After visiting Guna caves, Pillar rock, moir point, we came for Boating around 4 PM. We took a boat in Municipality Boat house( which is too cost. They rated for every 20 minutes. Whereas the rowing club boat house cost the same for 30 minutes.) for 20 minutes ride, then we went to Kodaikanal Rowing club boat house for one hour trip. Some of us are not in a mood to enjoy that evening, as got tired after 2 ½ hours of trekking. After boating we went to hotel, after refreshing ourselves, we went to J’s Heritage at 7 PM. We had a nice discotheque(let it be), camp fire & dinner (No one will forget the sweet “bread custard” & kara “rasam”). We went to bed after 9.30 PM.

<strong style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;"">Day 3: (20- Mar 2011 – Sunday)

Wake up @ 6 AM to watch the sunrise, had a nice tea, vadai @ Munjikal (Sponsored by Raghu). Then we had Breakfast @ Ayyappa mess @ Munjikal. Went to Upper lake view, Bryant park. There we saw the complete mist for the first time in our 3 days trip. After that we went for Cycling (1 hour – 2 rounds – 4kms each). Exceptional is kumar, he went for 3 rounds in the same time. After that we went for shopping. We bought costly chocolates in “Mannar chocolate factory” (1kg – 650), run by a malayali. Also we bought some chocolates in the nearby shop for 270/kg. we ate natural ice-cream, Puffs @ pastry corner. We went to Shop Oils, then we visit Poombukar (Govt shop) in Anna salai. From there we left kodai @ 3 PM. We reached Batlagundu around 4.30 PM, had a tender coconut. Reached Madurai around 6 PM. Ate Halwa from “Prema vilas” shop (also bought snacks), went to Meenakshi amman temple Gopuram on West side, had dinner @ 7.15 PM @ “Hotel Sabari’s”. We reached on time in Mattuthavani. We left there by SETC A/C bus (I need to mention it anyway) & reached Tambaram around 4:30 AM, the next day.

Novidade desta paragem fresca, aromatica e revigorante.

Encontro o meu ritmo. Consigo ouvir o meu coracao, mansinho no seu lugar, falando baixinho. Ouco sem angustia, com muita calma, muito em mim.

Construo tolerancia nesta terra e gente estranha, adapto-me as circunstancias. Na Europa fico fulo quando algo nao funciona. Aqui fico feliz quando algo funciona. Sempre esta coisa da gestao de expectativas...

police post
front lamps or indian lanterns
Driving from Maana Madurai to Madurai, I spotted a police post. It is a small post with not much existence to the public. I caught this picture because this is a rare site that I could not resist to capture something unusual. Water plastic pots as lamp post. The evening sunlight shone at the water pots giving a glow like Chinese red lanterns. Either the police station has run out of budget, maybe slogan says, ""Counter Measures with Least Budget"". What about ""Waste Not Campaign""? My driver and I had a good laugh and even louder as he continued to say, ""This is Indian Culture"". I certainly agreed.

Rain in Kanyakumari
The early morning walk to Kanyakumari Temple
I stood still mesmerizing the Indian Ocean, on my right is the Arabian Sea; turning to the left is the Bengal Bay. I felt great and happy to be in a place where the ocean, the sea and the bay collided together at this very point where I stood. Winds of change that gave me such thrill and not sure exactly which direction of wind came from. Felt the cold waters over my feet, coarse sand that kept overlapping onto my feet, in between my toes, each time the waves charges towards me and at this moment I asked to myself, when was the last time I had such fun at the beach.

Despite the drizzle, people still throng to this place for a splash, a dip in, children got excited over the waves on icy waters. Bargaining over sarees, clothes and seashells, scattered open fish market, while the fishermen awaiting good sales on this lovely beach of Kanyakumari. Kanyakumari is named after a Goddess literally meant The Virgin Goddess, there is a temple of Kanyakumari, and where the uniqueness of this statue is that there is a big diamond placed on her nose. The British Royal took the other.
The walls of Kanyakumari
towards the sea and mahatma gandhi's mousaleum
Devotees queue for hours just to pray and pay respect to her. I went in too.

There nearby is the Mahatma Gandhi’s Mousoleum. A huge pink building with moghul minarets consists of his photos and stories during his time as a prime minister. Across the mainland, there are two small islands; one could see from afar the statue of Vivekananda which is an island stood majestic but a concrete of lonely four walls. On one island, where visitors are not allowed, whilst the other has a main hall, a temple, bookshops and a meditation hall for those who wants to meditate for awhile. Only ten minutes. One can have a good view of Kanyakumari town, the thousands wind turbines across the island, a church, ferry boats busily their bouts from mainland port to this island. I am a bit astounded by the fact that a small town of Kanyakumari, situated at the Southern tip of India, isolated from big cities, still undeveloped that could fetched such good tourism in this part of India. Watching all these, people were friendly. Well ! not always.

The great wonders of the wind, the waters and the rain did made me feel

great. A cozy place for a holiday to reckon with. Highly recommended. I just can't imagined I am actually in Kanyakumari, the tip of Southern of India and the three worlds.

The New Indian Masala
The Standing Auto Paint Spray
I was driven from Maana Madurai to Madurai City in the late night. It took us about half an hour to reach the city but I was redirected to another place, my driver's relative place, which the whole family wants to meet me. On my way there, darkness catches up very soon, street lights lighted up, looking at my watch it was only 6.00pm. In my country this time is still bright that it will take another hour or more to see the street lights on. What amazes me was I caught a photo by chance that really made the world of paint companies looked rather less competitive. A new brand spray was born, solely Indian. A versatile standing auto paint spray, free style featured with the branded New Indian Masala Paint. Paint the world colorful, bright lasting and durable not forgetting that it came in different sizes, shapes and usage, just for the India.

Well! You will get to see when you step in India. All on walls, five foot path, country main roads, behind trees if there is any, and the streets in all states.

WALLAH ! VIVA !

You Light Up My Life !!!

Rameswaram Temple
After the dip in the bengal bay, heading towards Rameswaram for the Big Splashes. Wish me Luck!
Like everyone else, I was dressed only the vesthy, ushered by the committee members for a quick holy dip at the Bengal Bay in the quaint little town of Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu. I choke as I got to swallow some sea water while taking the dip. I am the fairest of them all. All eyes stared at me, I felt awkward but I just kept going trying to shake the waters off me, kept myself dry. But not for long.

Inside Rameswaram Temple, there are twenty wells. According to the Hindus, these wells contain holy waters to cleanse our sins. I wondered how thick my sins were as I walked in to get my first shower at the first Theertam (well). Each well I was showered with three buckets full of water. Imagine these, there were twenty two, three wells were closed to public. Can you now calculate how many buckets I had for that hour of holy shower? Fifty seven buckets!

Everybody had a splash only, while I had three buckets full from each Theertam. I laughed to myself, “Dear God, am I that DIRTY?”

The Indians were friendly, they smiled at me, they must think I
The Last Theertham
I raised my hand as soon as I touched the twenty second Theertham.
am funny, maybe because it is rare to see a Chinese come this far for this auspicious bath. I was not alone! I met two Europeans inside the temple, came for the same reason and I was glad that the temple committee do not have such stringent rules and regulations on foreigners. I guessed we were blessed for having such great opportunity to have this experience in our lives. But this will be my first and the last of the big splashes of my life.

The temple is huge; consist of three sections, the Lord Shiva main shrine with the twenty two Theertams, Parvati’s section and Hanuman’s shrine. The Lingam in the Lord Shiva’s shrine is made of sands from the beach nearby, when Hanuman could not make it in time with the Lingam from Kailasam (The Himalayas) for an auspicious puja. Sri Sita was the lady who made this Sand Lingam possible for the puja to get rid of Brahamahathya Dosham. Lord Shiva with his consort Umadevi appeared in the sky and proclaimed that those who bath in Danuskodi and pray the Sivalingam would be purified from all sins and they will get all progeny (Shanthana Pakkiiyam) since

Dong Lee Posed For The Cover - Tamil Fashion
I had a great time in Madurai on the 16 February 2013. The intention was to visit Meenatshi Amman Temple, Palamudircholai Temple and Tiruparamkundram Temple. I went there for two reasons, to pray and to photograph places of interest. Somehow this journey seems to have added something extra which I never thought to be, that is to visit my driver’s home and to meet his family and friends. They all called me Dong Lee, the Chinese kung fu actor in a Tamil movie, 7 Am Arivu.

I also met the Kamal Hassan Double, a stunt actor, now retired, a very friendly flower vendor with the most striking painted forehead just by the side of the main entrance of Tiruparamkundram Temple. I met my barber. He was gentle with my head. Pardon Me. The customer who sat behind me just gazed at me for a long time until I snapped at him, waking him, caught him in awe situation, everyone laughed, like he have never met a Chinese before. I found out that I was the first Chinese ever entered this barber shop and the back lanes of Madurai. The most wonderful moment I had was when I handed out coconut
Kamal Hassan's Double - Stunt Man
candies to the children that now I still can recall how happy they were. Enthusiast faces, grinning teeth, big eyes, tiny palms stretched out for the candy. Little ones always made me smile.

In the back lane, a lady posed as she washed her laundry, a handsome little boy bravely posed with me and family photographs of some neighbors, driver's family included which made my blog and my album a memorable one. Not forgetting my personal best photograph, leaned against the entrance of someone’s door with the colorful Tamil wordings on the wall at one of the back lanes of Madurai. Quite a model, Ya?

March 3rd 2013

Arjuna's Penance
We arrived in Mamallapuram (aka Mahabalipuram) after a two hour public bus ride from Pondicherry. We had some difficulty figuring out which bus to take, and I almost got in a fight with a man who was extremely rude to us for simply trying to ask for directions...The ride went smoothly, though, and we got there in the late afternoon. The town kind of reminded me of a smaller version of Hampi, in that its main attraction was a cluster of ancient ruins. These ruins, however, were much closer together, and were significantly fewer in number than in Hampi. Mamallapuram is known for it's impressive and intricate stone carvings, which can be seen in its ruins as well as its handicraft shops, where the tradition lives on. We had a good time exploring them and were happy that all the ruins were within walking distance, allowing us to see the majority of them in our first day. We also enjoyed getting a feel for the little tourist town, which was lined with handicraft shops, most of which were selling goods from Kashmir and Rajasthan rather than the local area. This encouraged us to do a bit less shopping, since we were
Krishna's Butter Ball (yes, that's the real name)
heading to Rajasthan soon, but I did get drawn in to a shop or two...On our first night, after eating dinner at a local restaurant, we walked across the street to check out a store that had pretty jewelry in the display window. Two hours later, after much chatting and bargaining, we left with a nice, antique looking paisley ring that we paid almost $15 for (rather pricey for a ring that didn't contain any precious metals). The salesman assured us it was a good quality piece, but, after a day of wearing it, it turned my finger green...which he specifically said it would not do. I thought about returning the ring for a refund, but I really liked it, so I guess I'll just have to deal with the ""side effects."" After our lengthy purchase, we chanced upon the one and only shopkeeper in India (seriously, I'm pretty sure he's the only one) who was in possession of a working refrigerator. He sold us ice cold drinks, for which we were very grateful given the unrelenting heat in the town, and we visited him several times during our stay.

Though I was very pleased with it at first,
Monkeys
I quickly developed a love-hate relationship with the guest house we booked in Mamallapuram. We didn't book ahead, but it was recommended in our guidebook, so when we arrived we asked to be dropped off at Siva Guest House. The man who greeted us was friendly and enthusiastic, and happily showed us a few rooms, all of which were fairly big and clean and were on the third floor with a great breeze and a view of the nearby ocean. We picked one and got settled in, having gotten a pretty good first impression of the place. As soon as we set foot on the beach, we were glad we hadn't booked a beachfront hotel in that it was disgusting and covered in trash. Thankfully, we weren't visiting Mamallapuram to relax on the sand. On the morning of our first and only full day in the town, we dropped off a pile of laundry at the front desk and were told that it would be ready for us that evening. We then ate breakfast and walked over to the Shore Temple followed by the remaining ruins we'd not yet seen. After that, to Scott's dismay, I was in the mood
Stone carved cave
to do a little more shopping and bought some cool stitched leather flats and yet another wrap skirt. We found haggling to be pretty tough, though, so that was our last shopping excursion.

We ate a late lunch, then went back to the room to rest and avoid the heat. Later on, after dinner, we searched for the night manager so we could pick up our laundry, but he was nowhere to be found. We looked behind the reception counter to see if our clothes were there since it was late and we really needed to pack, and there it was in a big pile on the floor, unfolded and still damp with other people's laundry mixed in. WHAT? When the manager finally did show up, we complained about our ""clean"" laundry being left not only on the floor, but unattended, and the first thing he said was that (a) the floor was very clean (false...) and (b) that's just where the laundry ladies put it and his job was only to fold the laundry (which he obviously had not done) and collect the money. Without any apology or attempt to rectify the situation, he told us to wait
Ruins and tree at sunset
ten minutes and he'd fold it and bring it upstairs. When he did bring it up, it was poorly folded, some of it was missing, some pieces were still wet, and he'd given us a few items of other people's laundry...at this point we were quite angry and demanded to speak with his supervisor, which he refused to let us do. Instead, he said to pay him or leave and kept walking away from us in a huff every time we tried to talk to him. While I stayed behind refolding the clothes and hanging the wet ones up to dry, Scott followed the man downstairs to try to reason with him. This proved to be futile, even when the owner's son showed up to offer his ""help,"" which consisted of him telling Scott that this is the kind of service you get in India and that he should stop wasting his energy and pay. So we did. We ended up getting an accidental discount, however, due to their poor math, so that was nice.

We left early the next morning for the Chennai airport via the taxi we'd booked through the hotel. Crazy guy was up waiting for
Boulders
us but wouldn't talk to or look at us...The cab ride was fine, though, and we got to the airport in plenty of time for our 9:10 a.m. flight to New Delhi. The airport was really strange, however. We had to go through security as soon as we walked through the door, and the lady zip tied one of the several entry points of my backpack (even though I'd already locked it) but not the rest of them. Not only that, but we had to show our tickets/passports to two people in a row who each recorded our information in spiral notebooks while non-foreigners just walked by each station. Oce we got past all that and checked our bags, everything was good, and our flight went smoothly. We arrived in New Delhi around noon and took a prepaid taxi straight to the train station to catch our 3:05 p.m. train to Agra. The taxi ride took about an hour due to traffic, so we got to see a little bit of New Delhi during the ride. The neighborhoods we drove through seemed very nice and clean, with parks and flower beds everywhere. Scott assured me, since he'd been to the
Sunset
city before, that there were still slums and bad areas, but maybe the city had been making an effort to clean up.

When we reached the train station, we still had two hours to wait, so we decided to check out the cafe near the entrance. This was an unpleasant experience, in that I tried to order some sweets but was refused service for some reason that I couldn't understand, and the guy at the counter was rude and rolled his eyes at me. Weird. So we left and went to our platform, bought some snacks there and read until our train arrived. The ride was only about three hours, and, though a little warm, was fine. I had an upper berth and relaxed and slept most of the way. This made it pass quickly, and, before we knew it, we were in Agra where the majestic Taj Mahal awaited us. 😊

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Pondicherry
March 3rd 2013
Published: March 3rd 2013


Pondy Street
After a complicated but hassle-free journey involving a taxi, three rickshaws, two buses and a train, we arrived safely to the small, south-eastern ex French colony of Pondicherry (aka Puducherry). We checked into our cute, brightly decorated guesthouse, Le Reve Blue, run by a high-energy and eccentric French woman, and immediately went out to find some dinner. Due to some poor planning, neither of us had eaten anything substantial all day. We settled on a French/Indian restaurant with good food but, to our hungry stomachs' dismay, very slow service. Afterward, we made a water and snack run and stopped at a few pharmacies in search of some medicine to cure Scott's chronic sinus problems before returning to our guesthouse and going to bed. Though I have very few complaints about our room, I will say that our bed was hard as a rock - which is pretty standard in Asia - and did little to aid the back pain I've developed over the past few weeks due to a combination of toting my heavy backpack around, sleeping on trains and buses, and, well, staying in guesthouses with boards for beds. Despite this, our exhaustion allowed us to sleep well and late,
Church
just in time for lunch.

We ate at a Vietnamese place, and, even though I was afraid I'd had enough Vietnamese food to last me a year, I thoroughly enjoyed my bun bo. We then stumbled upon a French bakery, where I had a delicious chocolate croissant. After that, most of our day was spent relaxing, exploring our neighborhood, continuing our quest for Scott's medicine, and sitting in an internet cafe attempting to plan the next few legs of our trip. For dinner, we checked out a little rooftop restaurant called New Banana Cafe, which was a bit pricey but didn't disappoint.

Our next day began with us engaging in a wild goose chase in search of a highly recommended breakfast spot. After asking several people with no luck, we were about to give up when it turned up right in front of us. I don't know if wandering around in the heat first thing in the morning was totally worth it...but the coffee was excellent. We continued by walking along the seaside promenade, followed by some exploring and shopping around town. We stopped at a few stores and picked up some souvenirs, including a ceramic incense holder
Pondy Waterfront
and two batiked wall hangings. After that, we went to the post office to buy some stamps, took a stroll through a little park and got some ice-cream before heading back to the guesthouse for a nap. The remainder of our day consisted of laziness, another dinner at New Banana Cafe and a visit to a trendy shop called Pondy Wallah where I purchased an awesome bright yellow Royal Enfield motorcycle t-shirt (since I love motorcycles so much...).

The following day, we switched guesthouses because we wanted to stay one more night, but our guesthouse was booked. Our host referred us to a place down the street that was the same price and very nice. We spent much of the day relaxing - since leaving the mountains, this has become a trend again as a way to avoid the hottest part of the day - before walking over to the Botanical Gardens (arguably the fictional setting of Pi Patel's family's zoo in the novel/film Life of Pi). If Pi's family had really owned a zoo in these botanical gardens, I'm sad that they left. Maybe they wouldn't have let the place fall into such disrepair. I'm not sure that
Pondy Street
broken fountains, half-finished landscaping projects and sporadically placed piles of dirt really qualify as a botanical garden...needless to say, our walk through this disaster zone was somewhat disappointing, but not really surprising considering the state of the town itself. Don't get me wrong, Pondicherry definitely has its perks: impressive and beautiful colonial buildings, a nice sidewalk next to the sea, hospitable guesthouses, and, of course, delicious food. However, like most cities we've encountered, trash litters the roads (most of which in our neighborhood were ""under construction,"" meaning the sidewalks had been bulldozed and what remained were giant piles of broken bricks and dirt), the canals contained little water and mostly garbage, and many buidling projects appeared to have been abandoned ages ago. On the bright side, at least the botanical gardens were free!

Our next stop was the internet cafe, where Scott logged into his recently created (free, and very useful) Indirail account to gather information about the train we needed to book for our upcoming trip from New Delhi to Agra. Although the site doesn't accept Scott's credit card since it's not Indian issued, it has allowed us to figure out the names and codes of the various
Doorway
trains and stations in the cities we're leaving from/headed to, so that when we go to the train station to book our tickets, we can simply fill out a request form instead of having to deal with the language barrier and explain where we want to go, what berth we want, etc. to the clerk while people try to push their way in front of us. We definitely recommend this method to those travelling through India via train, as the train station is always crowded, and, if you don't have your act together, someone will finagle their way in front of you and cut you off - even if you're in the middle of booking your ticket. If you prefer using travel agents, it's certainly easier and less chaotic, but you'll end up paying more for your ticket. If you're cheap like us, show up prepared, and brave the crowds.

Once we'd taken care of business, we had a nice dinner date at a fancy hotel/restaurant called Villa Shanti. Though the service was a bit slow, the ambiance and food were amazing. We had delicious stuffed mushrooms for an appetizer, I oredered baracuda for dinner, and we shared a
New Friend
tasty (yet tiny) banana flambe for dessert. We ended up stopping to buy snacks on the way back since we wanted a bigger dessert, and, in doing so, I discovered the Indian (and much cheaper) version of Milano cookies...yum! I may have to smuggle a duffel bag full of these back to the states...

Even though we didn't do too much sightseeing in Pondicherry, it was nice to spend time there. Aside from the canals and main streets, the city was relatively clean and quiet with somewhat of a Charleston feel near the water. The traffic and roadside ""construction"" were annoying at times, but overall we enjoyed ourselves and would surely return.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Kodaikanal
March 2nd 2013
Published: March 3rd 2013


Kodaikanal




I’ll begin this post by saying we’ve officially been in India for a month! My how time flies! We made it to Kodaikanal, a small hill station in Tamil Nadu, a little after lunchtime. The owner of our guesthouse, B’s Hive, sent a taxi to pick us up, and we were dropped off and shown to our room. Not only did only did our room give us a wonderful view of the hills and valley, but, since it wasn’t occupied, we were upgraded to a bigger room with a bay window and a veranda for free! Unfortunately, this turned out to be pretty much the only form of “service” we received during our stay. We never officially met the owner, and the staff was rarely anywhere to be found; therefore, whenever we needed anything, like laundry, food or a taxi, we had to call the owner who would then track somebody down to help us. When we finally were able to send out our laundry, it took forever and wasn’t ready when they said it would be, and when Scott needed change after paying for the room, it took them until our last day to give it
Steep Alley
to him. In any case, the room itself was very nice, clean and big (and even had hot water, since it was actually cold there), despite the slight annoyances of people playing loud music at night and dogs howling all night long.

Being in a small town with less traffic and pollution, not to mention nice, cool weather, has been a welcomed change, which is why we extended our stay from the initial two nights to almost a week. We found some good restaurants with Indian and Tibetan food (though their hours seemed to be ever changing), and we browsed several of the local handicraft shops, a few of which supported good causes, such as helping disadvantaged children and empowering women from rural areas.

During our stay in the mountains, we got some good exercise by taking walks into town, which was quite a hike from our guesthouse and ALL uphill, and we enjoyed walking around the lake and spending some time taking in the natural beauty of the area. One day, we even took a long hike up to a nice lookout point called Green Valley View, but, after pushing our way through a tunnel of sales
Our Bay Window
people and braving the monkeys lining the railing, we decided not to stay long. Afterwards, we continued our hike to see some neat rock formations called Pillar Rocks. It was a really long walk, but very beautiful, and we were happy to be out of the city for the first time in awhile. On our way, we passed a few schools, some nice little cottages, and an interesting golf course unlike any I’ve ever seen in the states. Not only were there several people crowded around a hole at a time, but the hole was surrounded by netting, making us wonder how exactly one is supposed to go about putting…Dad, if you have any insight, let us know!

Once we’d made it to Pillar Rocks, we were exhausted from walking, so we tried to catch a cab back into town. The man refused to give us a fair price – a problem we’ve encountered often in this country, as all drivers refuse to use their meters – but when a local saw us struggling, he offered to give us a lift on his motorcycle. We were a little wary to (a) accept a ride from a total stranger and
View near Pillar Rocks
(b) attempt to fit the three of us on the bike, but the sun was about to set and we didn’t want to get stranded, so we went for it. The man was very nice and took us all the way to town for free, but when he dropped us off, a policeman reprimanded us for “triple riding,” which is apparently illegal even though we’ve seen entire families on motorcycles here. We thought he was going to give us a ticket (in which case we planned to plead ignorance), but luckily he just gave us a warning.

One day we ventured over to Coaker’s Walk, a path that we’d been told had some great mountain views, but it turned out to be very short and cost money, deeming it slightly underwhelming. We also paid to walk through Bryant’s Park. This was a nice area with a cool greenhouse, but it didn’t appear to be very well kept up…the fountain in the pond was broken, and the water looked gross. And there was trash everywhere. We decided the lake was the best place to go for a walk, even if it did mean being frequently pestered by strangers to have
Carrying Firewood
our pictures made with them. Aside from eating, shopping and reading, we spent a lot of time just relaxing and enjoying our surroundings. All the shop owners we talked to were very nice and hospitable – one had kids studying in America and legitimately asked Scott to be on the lookout for a potential husband for his daughter (haha), and one man appreciated Scott’s haggling skills (though he did give us a hard time) and invited us to drink chai with him. Also, considering we were there every day so I could catch up on my blogging, I’m pretty sure the folks at the internet café probably think we’re computer addicts.

Our next stop was Pondicherry, which required a complicated day of travelling, but was very nice - you’ll hear about it soon! We’ve also made the executive decision to spend our final three weeks of travelling up north. On the 4th, we’ll be hopping on a plane to New Delhi, from which we’ll take a train to Agra to see the Taj Mahal. We can’t wait to see what the next few weeks have in store!

(I wrote this about a week ago and have been meaning to edit it before posting it. However, I have giving in to the fact that I probably won't find the time to do this. So hear it is in the raw...)







It feels like everything is about to change.

Four of the volunteers, two of whom have been here the whole time I’ve been, are leaving. Three more leave next week. The tests that I have been teaching towards will be over in two weeks time (at least for my subjects); I will have an almost entirely new schedule starting a week from Monday.

What grounding I have found here is feeling shaky.

All this change is happening about half way through my time here. How strange it is to think that I have been here for two months. It has gone by so quickly. So much has happened. And even stranger to think that I will be here for two more months. Especially as I cannot imagine what it will be like now that those to whom I have grow close will be gone and many of my classes will change.

I have been taught that every group follows the same pattern when they form. First, the group forms and gets to know each other in a very basic way. Then the group storms: people test boundaries and conflicts arise. Next, if the group is healthy, they will normalize; boundaries will be established and conflict can be resolved when it arises. At this point, the group is formed and functioning.

But here, because there are always people coming and going, I feel like it is impossible to get normalize. I feel that boundaries are inevitably unclear, that there isn’t an effective way to solve conflict. This instability makes progress feel unattainable.

But, when my head is clear, when I have slept enough, when I take time to look up at the sky and down at the smiling faces of the kindergarteners asking me make an elephant noise…when I do this, I feel excited about what is in store for me. I will have the opportunity to come close to even more students. A chance to meet new challenges inside and out of class. More time to be alone and read or walk or simply think.



Thankful for…

Enough clarity of mind to see the beauty of what has been and the opportunity of what is to come.

West Tower of Meenakshi Temple

As soon as we got off the train in Madurai, we were swarmed by rickshaw drivers (as usual) and very pushy beggars, one of whom inadvertently flashed us due to a poorly wrapped sari. We figured out that the hotel we'd booked wasn't terribly far away, so, despite the heat, we decided to walk. When we arrived at our prospective hotel, we were appalled by its dirty, run down state, as well as its jacked up prices, considering its website falsely advertised it as affordable and clean. Disappointed, we set out to find another hotel and settled on one nearby that, though still a bit pricey, was exponentially cleaner. After we checked in, we realized that it did have a few downsides, however, in that the beds were extraordinarily short with wide pillows, causing our feet to hang off the edge, and the power had a tendency to go out sporadically throughout the day and night, which we only really minded when we were sleeping and the fan shut off.


After about five minutes of walking around the city, we were reminded of Hanoi, a city in Vietnam that was not necessarily at the top of our list of
Street View
favorite places. We were disheartened to find the streets to be littered with trash (more so than usual) and the traffic to be heavy and terrifying - at least in Hanoi we only had to worry about dodging motorbikes! The city also maintained a constant haze of exhaust and pollution, making it difficult and unpleasant to breathe. I think it's safe to say that after this trip, Scott and I will have developed the lungs of chain smokers. Anyway, we did enjoy the wide selection of fresh juice stands, coffee and tea stalls, and sweet shops, and we managed to find a reasonably priced restaurant that we really enjoyed. We decided pretty quickly, though, that this wasn't a city we cared to spend much time in.

We spent our first day wandering through the city's famous (and huge!) Meenakshi Temple, marvelling at its massive, colorful gopuras, as well as its many shrines, sculptures and colonnades. We found ourselves surrounded by pilgrims, some laying themselves out on the ground in worship, and our visit was accompanied by continuous meditative music, both live and recorded. We even got to see the temple's elephant, who placed its trunk on the heads of
Rooftop View of Part of Meenakshi Temple
tourists and pilgrims as a form of blessing in exchange for rupees and bananas, which it peeled masterfully. We also had the pleasure of witnessing the elephant relieve itself right on the pavement in the midst of a crowd of people...let me assure you the urine and cow pies in the streets are nothing compared to this...

We spent much of our second day browsing a wide array of local hand woven textiles at a place near the temple called The Museum Shop. We went in just to look, but, after a few hours of being shown numerous wall hangings, rugs, pillow cases, etc. and kindly being served tea and biscuits by the shop's owner, we left having splurged on several items, including a giant hand stitched wall hanging with a peacock on it and a patchwork tree of life hanging. Everything there was very beautiful which made it difficult to choose, and we even got to go up on the roof of the building for a nice view of the temple. Aside from visiting the temple and shopping, we didn't do much sightseeing in the city. We found it to be a bit too chaotic for our taste
Elephant Giving Blessing
and booked a minibus bound for the remote hill station of Kodaikanal set to leave at 7:30 a.m. on the 21st. We were told that taking a private bus would get us there much quicker than a public bus, but, as it turned out, the bus didn't leave on time and made several stops about which we'd not been informed (a few times for photo-ops of the mountain views and once at a random science museum), causing the ride to take five hours instead of three. Also, our driver drove like a maniac on the winding roads, so I'm just glad we made it in one piece! We're excited to spend some time in the small, quiet, and, weather wise, much cooler mountain town. 😊

Total Distance: 227.63 miles / 366.34 km
Mouse: 0,0


fog_covered_mountains
Who we are: Sajid C U, Mukesh N S, Ali Akber, Libin, Gokul

Riding : Two Yamaha FZ 16's & a Yamaha YZF R15

The Route: Cochin-Pollachi-Pallani-Kodaikanal-Cumbam-Theni-Munnar-Cochin

Distance : 600

First of all I like to introduce ourselves, we are all engineers passed out from the same college (SCMS,Cochin) last year. I mean engineers of the same wavelengths despite the trades we had taken for specialization, we include Automobilians, a Mech'ie & a Computerian. We all hail from Cochin. Actually this aint our first trip we had done together, infact we had loads of these when we were undergoing our studies. But don’t know why i got a feeling to share this experience here.
It was a bright sunny morning around 10:00am we set are minds & told are rides ""KODAIKANAL"". We fueled our tanks, geared ourselves up & took off. We were aware of two routes to Kodaikanal, one via Pollachi-Pallani with loads of plane 'un-inclined' tarmac & the other via Munnar-Theni-Cumbum with plenty of 'inclined hairpins'. Infact we came to a conclusion that we head KODAIKANAL via the former route & return back via the latter one.

The route to the border was more
fog_hugging_forest
of a plain track with very few challenging curves, but the only challenging factor there was the scorching sun. As we entered Tamil Nadu, it was a whole new world. We came across to see ""WINDMILLS"" stretched for acres of dry land. We literally dint see any of the human race for about an hour. After a while, guess what...an old lady selling tender coconuts under a tree, it was like we found an oasis in the middle of a desert. This was it, we could quench our thirst as well as get directions. After having a couple of them, we set off again, now, heading to pallani.

In pallani it was a whole different story, we had no place on the road to ride our bikes. The roads were filled with people everywhere, also the loud sound of temple music. We also saw some people carrying a dead body coated with some whitish powder & behind it, people dancing. We later enquired about it, it seems it’s a ritual. By the time we drove for the next couple of hours we felt the coldness of the wind gushing through our helmets. We sensed KODAIKANAL is nearer.

We
fueled_&_geared_up
reached KODAI (as in Tamil) by dawn. It was so cold that jackets became an obligation. Wasting no time we rented a cottage in the town. It was after a while that i understood why the owner was stressing that his cottages had Geysers & Heaters, back in cochin its A/C rooms that are of demand, here its the other way round.

After getting ourselves freshened up, we took on the town on foot. Bought some 'drinking medicines' which were used to beat the cold in Russia... 😊 .Meanwhile we also had our dinner.

The next day we all got up together because of the intense cold climate outside. We had a quick bath & jumped on to our wheels. 'On the go' we had noticed a restaurant from where we had dinner last night. We had our breakfast , geared up again & prepared to get amazed by the beauty of KODAI. We came across fog covered mountains & fog hugging forests. We took lot of pictures till our cameras ran out of power. After watching the mindblowing sceneries of KODAI for a couple of hours, we noticed it was time to return.

As planned earlier,
halt_to_quench_thirst
we headed to Cumbam. Cumbam-Theni route was a smooth ride, but with couple of halts in between as the new by-pass road wasn’t fully constructed. Apart from that, the ride to Theni was a pleasant one & moreover we could take our rides to greater speeds. By asking the directions at correct junctions we headed towards outer munnar without any confusion as none of us had gone through this route before.

The route via Munnar was the extreme of all the experience we had along this whole ride. Twists & turns, hairpins, off-road. What else, everything. We kept in our mind that this is going to be the best of the experiences we are gonna have, so we dint want to slow down our bikes in the turns even though we dint know how severe the turn was.

We kept an average speed of 50kmph (except at hairpins where we had to slow down) throughout the twisties of Munnar.

We took couple of snaps, had a smoke & got on to our wheels again.

After we rode downhill we knew a shortcut to cochin. Around 10:30pm, we reached our destination after a whole lot tiring trip.
i_have_miles_to_go
But the most happiest fact was, in spite enjoying & experiencing the whole trip, we reached back, ALL IN ONE PIECE. As said, Safety First....!!!

A few weekends ago, we went to Bangalore. It was strange. Bangalore is so western; it felt like a different country. We explored, shopped, ate. It was relaxing and fun to be with the other volunteers, and as always enjoyable to see a new place. Saturday night, we decided to go to the Bull Temple, which someone had recommended to another volunteer. The nine of us got into three auto-rickshaws, asked the driver to take us to the Bull Temple, and were on our way. As we weaved through the Bangalore traffic passing shops, and tall buildings, and bars—there aren’t any in Tamil Nadu, only “wine houses” occasionally visited discreetly by men—it was easy to forget that we were on our way to a Hindu temple. When we arrived, the other two rickshaws where nowhere in sight. Before I could wonder how we lost them, we noticed a sign hanging over the entrance to the temple compound: Iskon Temple. Not the Bull Temple. When we told the driver that he had taken us to the wring temple, he was frustrated. We ask him how long it would take to get the Bull Temple, and he said about 30 minutes. The temples
IMG_2456
were going to close in an hour’s time, and we didn’t think that half an hour would be long enough to enjoy the temple, so we decided to stay and see the temple we had accidently visited.

What a strange experience. I have never experienced anything quite like the Iskon Temple. The foreignness was magnified by tiredness from a long day and by the fact that we hadn’t meant to go there in the first place. It was incredibly crowed. What must have been thousands of people were winding their way through security and a shoe drop-off (visitors are not allowed to take their shoes or their cameras into the temple). Then in a zigzag line that resembled a line at an airport, we made our way into the temple. A young Indian man introduced himself to me, asking if I would like a guild because it would give him a chance to practice his English. I agreed, so he introduced me to his family—parents, sisters, grandmother, and cousins. I followed the other volunteers, and this large Indian family followed me in a line to the first part of the holy space. As we entered, we were lectured by
IMG_2457
a priest to join in the chant. With every step, as we zigzagged along, we were supposed to chant what I think was Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna, Krishna, Krishna, Hare. Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama, Rama, Hare. This was not easy, especially for my Russian roommate, to say. There I was, standing in line moving a foot at a time, chanting what might have been the correct words, my roommate giggling because of her accent, the Indian man behind me whispering instructions and questions about the States, in a line that reminded me more of an amusement park than a place of worship, in a temple we hadn’t intended to visit. I felt ridiculous. Then I felt guilty for feeling ridiculous. My light view of the scenario seemed somewhat disrespectful of the people in line praying.

Finally we finished the chanting and the line picked up pace. We filed past minor shrines, too quickly for prayer, but slowly enough to put coins in the collection box. When we entered to main temple, at first it reminded me of a mall or park. People milling about, families sitting together eating. But then I heard the bells ringing from
IMG_2458
the ceiling. It was a beautiful sound, but distant. We made our way to the shrines. Some people, like us, continued in the line past the shrines, pausing only long enough for a glance. Others left the line to be closer to the deities. Crowds gathered around the brightly lit statues, leaving their offerings and their prayers. Another shrine was not for a deity, but for a religious leader, presumably dead. People had left offerings there, too, and a man lay prostrate at the statues feet. I felt overwhelmed and uncomfortable. Prayer and spirituality are so deeply personally to me. I can’t imagine praying in such a crowed place. And I felt like a voyeur for being there when other people were.

We all decided to leave, thanked out impromptu guild, and made our way to the exit. In order to leave the temple, we had to walk through several gift shops, past countless collection counters, and through a food court. After one of the gift shops, we came to another shrine for the religious leader. I glanced down a hall to the left of the shrine that led to an open room. Sitting in the room was the
IMG_2459
man whose statue I was facing. The image of the man praying prostate in the noisy and crowed temple seemed even stranger to me knowing that he prayed to a living man, who sat cross-legged on a lush pillow typing on his computer just a few feet below. Finally, we returned to our shoes and cameras, and then to the street to find a rickshaw back to the hotel. I still have not fully processed my trip to this temple, but I know that it was surreal and that I do not have the focus to worship there. Or the tolerance for gift shops.



(The photos are not of the temple, as I wasn't meant to take pictures. There are pictures from the hotel, the botanical gardens, and elsewhere)



Thankful for…

The rollercoaster continues. So many frustrations and excitements, misstep and successes to share. But in this post I will be brief. I think this story deserves an entry of its own.

Last weekend, eight of the older girls were interviewed by ABC/Univision. Another ASTEP volunteer and I were asked to help the girls practice for the interviews, which were to be done over skype. I am so grateful I had the opportunity to do this. In talking about the questions they would likely have to answer, I was privileged to know more about these incredible young women than I could learn in class. They were all very articulate, expressing their thankfulness for the present and their hopes for the future. When I asked them what they want to do after they graduate, they all spoke of going to college—remarkable when you consider that they will be the first in their families to finish high school, if any education—and they all spoke of helping others with their education. I was amazed by the grace and gratitude each girl exhibited. There are few children in the States who will speak of their education as a privilege and responsibility. Hearing them speak made me proud of the school and excited to be here.

One student said something like this when she was asked why she wants to study literature: “I love poetry, because it helps you understand other people and their emotions. I can get to know a lot of different people. My parents really wanted me to study business or science. I want to prove that I can be myself <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">and be successful.”

Later when she was asked what it means to her to be the first in her family to receive an education, she said something like this: “There are so many 'He's the first's. 'He is the first to the moon.' 'He is the first to win the contest.' There are so many times when a 'he' is the first. But 'She's the first,' is new and exciting. When I think about being the first to graduate high school and that I am a 'she' I am so grateful and excited. So excited. At first coming to school here seemed like a burden. I had to study all the time, even when I went home I had to study. Because my parents expected me to do well. Because I was the only one getting an education. So I felt a lot of pressure. But then I realized that I was a snail and my education is my shell. It is heavy and I have to carry it everywhere, but it is also my protection. What allows me to live.”

Kodaikanal - rhododendron en fleurs
Nous avons pris congé de la chaleur et les temples et nous sommes allés dans les montagnes.

LES PALANI HILLS
Le bus local A/I nous a emmené a travers le mix habituel de belle route asphaltée avec lauriers et bougainvilliers au milieu, routes de campagne a travers des villages pauvres pour monter les derniers 48 km sur une route de montagne en lacets serres serres tricotes en têtes d'épingle. La vue était superbe et heureusement le chauffeur était très bon et avançait lentement. Car chaque fois qu'on rencontrait un autre véhicule dans une tête d'épingle nous entrions dans un incroyable ""pas de deux"" en changeant la direction avec l'autre véhicule. De quoi s'émerveiller et s'exciter! Les Palani nous ont accueillit avec un parfum lourd et fruité absolument enivrant, qui embaumait de ses efleuves l'atmosphère. Tout un changement des effluves pestilentielle qui parfument des fois les villes! On nous a dit que c'était de petites oranges sauvages incomestible, qui poussent dans la région. On en redemande!
Kodaikkanal est une ville perchée a 2200 m d'altitude avec un climat agréable (+14C le matin, +17-18C a midi) propice a la randonne. Nous avons fait une petite en compagnie de Sekar,
Kodaikanal - trek
un indien très style qui nous a conduit sur un petit sentier d'où on a pu admirer les villages éparpillés dans les montagnes ou les locaux cultivent du café et du cacao. Car dans cette région le café est très bon et tout le monde fabrique du chocolat maison avec des fruits et des noix (malheur a nos silhouettes car les filles ont voulu encourager l'économie locale et ont donc teste plusieurs sortes!)
Les eucalyptus étaient magnifiques et nous avons découvert les premier rhododendrons fleuris! Leur rouge fonce s'agencait bien avec le jaune pale des mimosas et le lilas des jacarandas. Quelle belle randonnée!
Tôt le matin nous sommes allés faire le tour du lac local (lac artificiel construit par les anglais) 5 km de marche. Antoine et Cornelia ont eu la chance de le faire 2 fois car il y a eu malentendu avec Huguette qui quêtait les oiseaux. Nous sommes très chanceux qu'Huguette a cette passion qui nous a ouvert un nouvel horizon: les oiseaux. Elle est très contente car elle a déjà identifie pas loin de 60 espèces locales. Nous le sommes aussi car c'est une belle découverte pour nous!

LES NILGIRIS
Kodaikanal - notre guide Serak
On a quitte Kodaikkanal en bus pour descendre la montagne de l'autre cote, toujours en lacets serres et ""pas de deux"" dans le têtes d'épingles et nous sommes entres dans une zone de ""elephant crossing""! Mais non, nous ne les avons pas vu! Cependant l'indicateur était déjà quelque chose. Après 60 km dans les plaines nous avons recommence la montée des Nilgiris: lacets serres, paysages magnifiques, précipices épeurant. Nous sommes arrives a Coonoor, petite ville de montagne a 1950 m d'altitude, éparpillée sur plusieurs collines. Adorable! Nous avions un joli hôtel avec cour intérieure et balcon (protégé contre les singes envahissantes) avec vue sur les plantations de thé! Les gens sont incroyables, souriants ils nous saluent partout! Nous avons fait des petites marches dans les collines avec plantations de thé et les rues tranquilles envahies par les magnifiques plantes du sud: lantana rose-jaune-orange, jacaranda lila, drum-stick, poinsettia et ponsetiana rouges. Les maisons dans les plantations sont des immenses manoirs avec colonnes et terrasses. Celles en villes ne sont pas moins épatantes, entourées des fleurs et hauts murs. En fait c'est une ville riche. Il y a des maisons pauvres et minuscules des ouvriers des plantations mais l'impression générale est d'une
Kodaikanal - village lointain
les locaux cultivent le cacao et le cafe
ville aisée. Il y a aussi un magnifique parc avec des arbres majestueux apportes de partout au monde.
L'Inde des montagnes est totalement différente de l'autre Inde que nous avons vu: propre, fleuri, en majorité chrétien avec une importante minorité musulmane. Les hindous sont quasiment invisibles. Le nombre d'églises est incroyable (de toutes dénominations: catholiques, protestantes, pentecostales, adventistes, etc) et il y a pas mal de mosquées. D'ailleurs on entend souvent l'appel mélancolique du muezzin a la prière. On a eu la premiere pluie depuis le debut, heureusement elle est tombee pendant la nuit!
Nous avons quitte Coonoor en train historique: un petit train-jouet ancien monte jusqu'à Coonoor avec une locomotive a vapeur. A Coonoor on la change avec une locomotive diesel. On a donc pris ce train pour une heure de plaisir a monter a travers de petits villages de montagne jusqu'à Oooty, la reine des Nilgiris. Autre ville a 2200 m, plus grande, plus industrielle, plus musulmane, mais avec son charme. Son jardin botanique est le lieu de promenade des amoureux et des familles, celui ou on a été envahis par des gens qui voulaient se faire toujours photographier avec nous!Et nous avons dormi a YWCA,
Kodaikanal - maison fleurie
dans un bungalow de style monacale, dans un grand jardin tranquille sur une colline.
Et voila que notre semaine de montagne est finie, nous retournons dans la plaine et la chaleur. Descente tortueuse des montagne, traversée de 2 réserves de tigres (ils ne sont pas venus nous saluer!), arrivée dans un autre état. Et retrouvaille de l'hinduism car a l'entrée dans l'état de Karnataka le chauffeur a arrêté le minibus prive dans lequel nous étions devant un petit temple pour une puja, sans doute pour remercier les dieux de nous avoir protégé dans la descente des montagnes. Ne manquez pas la suite!

Tambaram to Vedanthangal

I planned to see the birds before sunrise. So on this day, I woke up at 4 in the morning (you may call it as a midnight). After freshen up, left from TBM around 4:45 AM & reached Vedanthangal at 5:59 AM. I win, still the sun is sleeping, but not the birds.

At-first, went for a hot Tea in the nearby shop. The temperature is not more than 18 -20 deg C, that country made boiler tea sweets good (Sweeeeet).



Much prior to my entry, thousands of birds are going out of the sanctuary. Oh! did it afraid of seeing me, no comments....go ahead.

Entered into the park, sorry its a sanctuary. (Status of ""National Park"" is higher; whereas a ""sanctuary"" is lower.). This difference doesn't sounds good though.

Nearly at 6:15, entered into the park. The same time the Sunrises from the place where there are lots of trees, birds, water, fresh air.... No words are coming now to describe it(even at that time too. I was mesmerized).



I saw different birds (coloured beak, black & grey, full black, pink... Sorry I doesn't know their family names). But one good & common thing about all birds is, it shits during flight & not while in the trees, I don't know what it do when it swims. (Romba Avasiyam)


Took lot of photos even after 9 AM. Got bid bored of taking photos continuously for 3 hours in an empty stomach. My bellies started to ring bells; Calm it with oranges, Bread, butter & Jam. (and a biscuit). Took some rest in the nearby bench.



Difference in temperature, the stench (from the birds) told me that its the time to leave. Around 10:30, left from there to reach Thirukalunkundram.

Vedanthangal to Thirukalunkundram

Instead of going via chengalpet, switched another option to reach Thirukalunkundram. I always love to explore these things (then I felt so bad of choosing it, that's different). The road leads from Karunguzhi to Thirukalunkndram (~20 KMS) is so worst. I can say there is no road, its a form of road with ground sand & some jallies. The path started with cement road for one KM & remaining, there is no piece of thar. Great expedition!!!!



Around 11:45, I reached at the foot hills of the temple. The small town is really awesome. It is surrounded by hills, green paddy fields, small tanks, a big carved temple pond. The temperature is getting hotter, so I decided to go up the hill to have darshan before the temple closes at 1PM.



With bare foot & some energy walked up the 300+ steep steps slowly & at a constant speed. Reached the hill top within 15 minutes. Whoa yeah!!!!

At the time I'm entering, the priest started to show a big Aarathi to the sivan. Had a nice darshan. Prayed the almighty with my both hands & after 2 minutes of ""Om Namasivaya"" mantra chantings, came around the Garbagraha (Outer peripheral). Say few monkeys over there. I don't know how i survey at that place, coz there is no water, no fruits/food... nothing. They seems to be much weaker. (Where is the blue crosssssss).

God might felt that, yes i'm in hungry. Suddenly a priest came before me & gave Sambar rice in plantain leaf. It tasted like Amirtham (you know it, there is a Tamil saying: When you're in Hungry, even the old food tastes better).

A priest (I don't know of which temple) came & I asked him about the name reason of this town. He briefed me about the Eagles coming there to eat the Swami Prasadham.

From his knowledge, Pair of Eagles (Rishi's - born as Eagles, may be a curse) after a dip at Kasi in the early morning, will go to Rameswaram to worship the God ""Shiva"" & return here, round the hill at 11:30 AM exactly & then came to a place in the hill top next to the temple to ate the Prasadham. The Sivachariya (Priest) gave the rice to eagles in his hands. After eating, it rubs its Beak in the rocks. This was happened till 1992. The ugly humans made this scene as a business & lot of crowd gathered to see this. It bothered the eagles & they stopped coming.



The view from the hilltop is so scenic, Thousand eyes are not enough to see it. The breeze from Bay of Bengal passes through the fertile green lands gives you a glimpse of feather touch. The sun is above my head (temp is 35 deg C) & I doesn't even feel the hot. Spent my time there till 1:30PM, & they asked me to leave, as they are closing the gates of the Hill path. The local people will go for a Hill round (Pournami Girivalam) on every full moon day like in Tiruvannamalai, Thiruparankundram....

<strong style=""outline: none;"">

Thirukalunkundram to Mahabalipuram

Left from there at 2 PM& reached Mahab’s A2B around 2:45 PM. After sumptuous lunch (Unlimited ma), get into the lawn for some time. No thinking about leaving that place (irukkatha pinna). Left there around 4 PM to “Five rathas”. Took snaps & around 5PM, left there to reach sea shore temple. Sun is going to set. Yes, I clicked a memorable picture of the trip. Clicked few more snaps & left Mahab’s after 6:30 PM, reached Tambaram around 8:15 PM

View from Sunvalley Homestay - Conoor
Its been only couple of months since our last family holiday to south of Maharashtra.But then i had mandy scheduled in November during Diwali.It was good opppourtunity for yet another family outing.We discussed and concluded to go.After a few deliberations, we zeroed out on Ooty & Mysore.Main reasons were seasons of the year.We wanted to experience the best winter of the season one can get in India and whats better than Nilgiry Mountains.Since air fare contributes maximum to your travel cost, we fixed that first well in advance.The route was Mumbai-Coimbatore-Bangalore-Mumbai.In fact there is no alternate if you are visiting ooty & Mysore from Mumbai.Post that i searched for the stay and after a lot of research using Trip Advisor and other travelportals, picked up below 2 which were slated as The Best in respective locations.

SUn Valley HomeStay - Conoor
Jade Gardens - Ooty

I booked in advance by making some advance payments.Both proved to be right choices at the end!!After celebrating Diwali in first week of my mandy with family and Friends, we started packing for the travel.But something untoward happened that we have never thought of.Local political party - Shiv Sena Supremo - Balasaheb Thakrey was
Dolphin Nose Point in Conoor
declared dead on Saturday evening..1 day prior to our departure.Given his influnence on Mumbai, it was but expected that everything in Mumbai will close down including taxies.I somehow managed to get the prints of our air tickets from Swapneel but till end of day there were questions on our local commute from home to airport.We called up Nikhil & Mai to help us.They incidentaly have just returned from their family holiday but in spite of that they offered their help to drop us to airport in case taxies are not running.Next day morning they came to our place but fortunately the cab driver called up and said he is ready to drop us to airport.We were relieved!!We safely reached the airport in time.We paid extra tip to the driver for his timely help.Affairs at the airport were running as usual but we had quiet a few passengers who were stranded at the airport for lack of ground transport!!Our flight was too on time.We had some snacks at the airport Cafe and boarded the 1150 am flight bound for Coimbatore.It was Sai's 3rd air travel.Last time she was bit restless so we were little nervous as to how she will react
Tea Factory Visit in Conoor
but she co operated really well.We kept her engaged on various things and she had a smooth ride..so did we.Coimbatore is a small town in State of Tamilnadu so the aiport was as expected small one with just 1 terminal.We got refreshed and contacted the taxi driver that we have booked with the Sun Valley Homestay.He was already there.In less than an hour after leaving Mumbai, we were on our way to Conoor on the road.Coimbatore airport to Conoor is almost 3.5 hrs road distance.We picked up some bakery products as we decided to skip the lunch.Conoor is almost 4-5 thousand feet above sea level.Hence the road on top was thru ghats.Sai has tendency to vomit on turning roads but luckily for us, she was sleeping.And good she was b'use these ghats have the most turns ..what they call as ""Hairpin bends""..almost in excess of 35.I dont know where else in the world or in india, you have those many curves to reach a hill station!!

By 430 pm we reached the Sun Valley Homestay.Last phase of the road there is undone hence approaching it in last stages raised questions about Sun Valley's stay.But all our doubts were put
Pyrakara Lake - Ooty
to rest when we got down at their property.Actual property was no different & as picturesque as in their profile pictures.They greeted us with warm welcome and after quick check in we stepped into our room named ""Clarke Quay"". All the 12 rooms there are named after places/monuments in Singapore. May be Singapore is favourate place of owner.Rooms were big and had balcony.Plus they have made very clever use of mirrors so the rooms appears bigger than actual.Balnocy offers fantastic view of the surrounding mountains which appears like layers of cones.Tea planatation is what you see all around on nice slopes of the mountains. This to my memory is one of best views that i have had in india so far!!That day evening we spent in getting refreshed.Had breakfast, explored the property & made plans for next 2 days in consultation with attendats there at Sun Valley.They can arrange for local site seeing plus car etc. We leveraged them and decided to explore Conoor & its suuroundings on day 1.After a good south indian breakfast,we left at around 1030 am.Minimum itinerary was Dolphin's nose,Sims Park & Tea factory.Dolphin's nose is a basically a view point on Nilgiris.One can see beautiful
Ooty Botanical Gardens
views of Nilgiris and some waterfalls if you come in Monsoons. Prominent among them was Katherine's waterfall which has a height of some 250 odd feet.One can see that from Dolphin's nose point.Road to Dolphin nose is pretty.Tea platations,mist..you feel like you are in heaven.Plus decent cold in the air.Unfortunately for us,that day there was lot of smog so we could see beyond a few feet for most of the time.Even view of Dolphin Nose was limited.But journey to & from there is one to remember!!By the time we finished those view points, it was noon.We decided to break for the lunch.Our driver took us to one of the better place around.We had lunch at leisure and it was important so that Sai has some time to digest and is ok during the travel.POst lunch we stopped at Sims Park.Its the Botanical garden of Conoor and is less famous than its Ooty's counterpart but after being to both the places, i would rate Sims Park higher simply b'use its better maintained than Ooty.I believe too much commercialisation deteriorates public places.Sims park is designed on a slope with trees & flowers from all over the world.It also has a mini pond
Rose Garden, Ooty
with boating facilities.There is a nice little children play area.It offered us good relaxation after a good afternoon lunch.Tea factory was just a few minutes drive from there.Apparently its the only operational tea factory in the area which allows visitors inside for a tour.We took one which is offered as free by some of the volunteers there.That Volunteer took us the the whole tea making process from start to end with quiet a bit of details which were news to us.Like there is also something called ""White Tea""which is most premium form of tea & costs as much as INR 18k per kg in international market!!You can get it cheaper at the factory of course.They have a shop where one can buy all their produce at reasonable prices.At the end, they allow you to explore their plantation and if you want can also click some pictures of you with your family that too in tradtional costume wore during cutting tea leaves!! Nice..isnt it!!On the way back, driver drove us thru Wilington area which is basically the area occupied by Indian Navy as its training base.Like any other military area,it was tidy, clean and well maintained!!That was the last stop.We reached
Toy Train from Conoor to Ooty
Sun Valley by 630.Had some freshly cooked snacks with hot tea before retiring to our room for relaxation.Dinner order was booked as soon as we arrieved that evening.And thats the norm at Sun Valley.They dont serve you stale food. They cook by order..fresh and delicious!!

Sunvalley management has also kept a local guide book in each rooms for help of visitors.We leveraged that extensively along with what we have researched.It has good info..somethings which you wont find on internet at times.Next day target was Ooty and surrounding area.It was not difficult to decide on that.You would visit 2 best places if you have only 2 full days there!on Day 2 we decided to give ourselves more time and asked if we could try the World famous ""Toy Train"" for one side journey.We were not hopeful as basis what we knew its schedule was not in our plan but thats where asking locals helps.There is a daily up-down service between Ooty & Conoor only of the same train.Last train from Ooty for Coonorr leaves at 6 pm.After realising this, we altered our plans accordingly.We decided to cover key places in such a way that we can reach Ooty station by
Sunrise Captured from Apartment Balcony
530 pm.And it worked very well!!Ooty is apporximately 1 hr drive from Conoor but our first stop was ""Pykara Lake"" which is another 1 hr from Ooty.So it took us some while after leaving hotel to reach there.Pykara is a fairly big lake to be situated on mountain hill.Whats more it man made.Surrounded by moountain ranges all across a 20 mins boat ride can be great fun with family.In our case Sai is afraid of waters so we were not keen but luckily we got a co traveller from Mumbai who were running short by 1 person for a family package.The lady invited 1 of us sensing that both of us wont be able to make it with Sai.I went ahead.Meeting co passengers like her on travel is good!!From Pykara it was journey back to Ooty.On the way we stopped at 2 interesting places.One is called ""Shooting Hill"".A hill top with a valley view.Apparently preferred by many directors for film shooting.and its indeed beautiful!!Only pain is you have walk 15 -20 mins uphill so it can be tiring!!Next stop was ""Nilgiri Jungle walk""You can see Nilgiri trees all across while travelling in Ooty/Coonooro but tourist taxis will stop at this
Majestic Mysore Palace
place b'use may be its along the main road.Leads to a small lake where excess water from Pykara Dam is released.Contrary to Shooting Hill, this one as reasonably steep slope.But best thing about this place is the tall trees and dense forest.Sun rays trying to space thru..beautiful..!!Here walking down was easy but coming back was difficult especially with Sai.But we somehow managed it.Now Sai was hungry too and was showing signs of that.So next we stopped for lunch at a city hotel.Was not a good choice.Exorbitantly expensive for not so delicious food.we just had sandwiches and left.That also costs us 200 INR which was definitely not worth it! Good thing was we saved some time on lunch and utilised it in our next stop which was Ooty Botanical Garden.More or less this features on each one's itinerary in Ooty and its good as well.Spacious..Some redeveloped structures at the entrance.But after exploring, i found more hype than substance in there.Sims Park is anytime better.But had i not been here, i would be able to compare!!Nam clicked best pics of me & Sai here..It was around 3 pm.We had couple of hours in our hand.Driver offered us few choices.His suggestion was Ooty
Black Swan in Mysore Zoo
Lake but we went for ""Thread Garden"".Reason was simple we have already been to Pykara.So instead of visiting another lake we picked up a place which showcases biggest variety of handmade flowers from all over the world made with thread.Its a unique museum of its kind in the world and has been pioneered by a Keralite.Using the services of some orphanges, he has been able to put up a good show of man's skills which amuses you.Definitely recommended for all!!It doesnt take more than 15-20 mins there so we still had time.Thus we decided to make the most of it by visiting ""Rose Garden"".Good thing in small towns is all places are nearby.It was hardly 10 mins drive.We were not very optimistic about this place but they surprised us.Designed on slope like Botanical, it houses rose varieties from all over the world including ""Black Rose""Fairly well maintained, its good to visit in early evening as sun sets.Here again Nam took some beautiful pics of Me & Sai!!We had nice time and manage to finish exploring it just in time to reach Ooty station for catching Toy Train.Reguler class cost peanuts at INR 5 and first class ticket will cost INR
Chamumdi Hills Temple in Mysore
85 we took first class to ensure that we have good seats and better comfort.Some folks even suggested against it but after boarding the train we realised we have made righ decision.Reguler class was full of locals & student returning from their school.In first class we had only 5 passengers including 3 of us.Sun was about to set so we didnt enjoyed the beautiful views from the train for too long but whatever we could was good enough memory to take back.Lot of tunnels on the way.hats off to engineers who consructed this line in such a difficult hilly area and that too in early 1900's!It was dark by the time we got down at Conoor.It was good 1 hr journey.Driver met us at Station parking and he dropped us to hotel.

Two days in Sunvalley went really well and we were really pleased with the kind of stay & service that we got there!Sunvalley had a lasge tea estate adjusent to the property and since its co owned by the same guy who owns the homestay, as a guest you are allowed to explore it any time..even cut some tea leafs and staff will make instant tea of
Bird Sanctuary Mysore
it.So on the day of check out, after packing out stuff we decided to experience the same.It was pleasant morning.Property looks nice from the estate too!Unfortunately Sai was not comfortable in the middle and hence we spent very short time there, clicked a few snaps and came back.Staff of sunvalley was as courtious for our farewell as they were when welcoming us 2 days back.we clicked a snap with the staff and started our journey towards Mysore.we have hired their car services only for that.It costs us INR 3000.We left by 1030 am.Route was interesting!! First climb down from Ooty..then enter Mylapuram Forest before entering Bandipur, both of which are known as Tiger Reserves.We were hoping for sighting some, but only saw some deers and elephants who were omisticated.There are as many as 36 hairpin curves while climbing down from Ooty towards Mylapuram.Luckily for us, this time as well Sai was sleeping!!State highway from TN to Karnataka was good.We instructed Driver to be slow & stable so journey was good except the food.Driver stopped at a roadside hotel which we didnt find good for food.This is the 2nd time, it was happening with same driver.Caution for all is to ensure
Islands in Bird Sanctuary Mysore
that you give clear instructions about your food preferance to driver's boss so that you get disappointment!It was around 415 pm when we stopped in front of Jade Garden hotel which we have booked for our stay in Mysore.Again thanks to tripadvisor.com.On the back of homely Sunvalley we were expecting similar experience at Jade but it turned out to be very commercial.No doubt hotel was good from food,hygene,facilities perspective but staff was not as people centric as we expected.May be language is a barrier!!Who knows? Check in was quick as i have booked in advance.Since it was early evening & we were still fairly fresh...plus nothing planned, we decided to explore the neighbourhood.Ask for some guidance at reception and were told that there is Big Bazar few hundered meters away.There was no better shopping oppourtunity than this!And we capitalised on that.First we had some snacks at the entrance of Big Bazar and then went inn.To our luck, we also met some localites of Mumbai who was serving there as staff and he helped us pick up some really nice clothes for Nam.Store was as big as you can get anywhere in Mumbai.Shopping was good and so was time spent.That night
Vrindavan Gardens, Mysore
we ordered food in the room which we realised is the best option considering nusance Sai would cause if we have to go down to the Restaurant.We tried it first time on our travel there and felt it gave us what we should do going forward while travelling.Jade Garden had a travel desk attached to it.We made some basic inquiries with them and considering that there are autos which run thruout the city,we decided to opt for that instead of expensive car hire for next day.

Next day ie Day 5 of our tour & first day in Mysore, we decided to visit top attractions ie Mysore Palace & Zoo at minimum and if time permits then few others.Palace was hardly 10 mins auto drive from the hotel.Fare INR 20.Mysore palace which boasts of being Mysore's identity is a heavily visted tourist spot especially for foreigners.And why not!Its a grand place and very well maintained too for all these years.Safety & basic arrangements were good.They also have battery operated cars for old/kids if anyone wants to hire them to explore the palace.Inside as well very well petroled by the guards, Mysore palace has been the home of Mysore Dynasty
Another View of Mysore Gardens
for over 100 years.Its the clan of Vodiyaar's who has been ruling as Kings of Mysore till it became part of India during independance.Inside the palace you will see pictures of their family/their royalty ..typical of any King's palace anywhere.The Diwan E Aam & Diwane E Khas..their temples, private rooms etc.And at the end it does makes an impression but folks like us who came from the land of Shivaji, didnt found it anythinking g better than a grand old palace of a king b'use in the land of Shivaji, Kings spent money on people & their welfare than their own.Good visit for enjoying the architectre of the old time as well!It took us around 90 mins to explore that.From there zoo was also hardly 10 mins drive.We hailed a auto & got down at the zoo.Now this was something intersting for us as its been years since we visited a zoo and Sai was also with us.We have read that Mysore Zoo is one of the best maintained in India so our hopes were elevated.We purchased the tickets ..some INR 30 per per person i think and got inn.After the entrance only you first get to see the tallest
5 Star Hotel within Mysore Gardens
mammals ie Jiraffe's..from there you proceed to birds section before getting to see wild cats and other animals.Except birds,all animals enclosures are cage free which is what you see abroad as well.Idea is to offer as natural view to visitors and also without compromising on safety ie they have big ditches between animal area boundry and visitors pathways.From all types of colourful parrots to Royal Bengal tiger to Rhino, you have everyone here.Whats more they also have Cheetah and India's only Gorilla there.Its wonderful.Some enclosures no doubt need upliftment like the one for Rain forests animals..It sticks badly in there.Canteen also was ok.Few areas were under constructions but all in all it didnt let is down.Only problem was Sai was reluctant to walk hence we felt tired earlier than expected while exploring the zoo.Towards the end one can also see kangaroo's, turtles, crocs which was amuzing.It also has big anaconda enclosure which was crowd puller in snakes section.Black Swan is something we saw for the first time there.It was almost 3 hours + that we were walking and were dead tired.All 3 of us hence took a small nap on one the benches there for some time to revitalise.Overall it was nice experience to see all those wonderful animals and in a fairly well maintained zoo!!We left from there by around 430 pm and wondering what to do when we noticed the plaque advertising Wax museum nearby.Wd didnt had a clue about it but it sounded intersting.Karanji Lake was original choice but when we learned that visiting hours for Karanji Lake were only upto 5pm and Was museum is on the same way, we decided to give it a visit.Its around 15 mins drive from Zoo towards Chamundi Hills area.we were little excited but all that excitement was washed away when we went thru that waz museum.It was nowhere close to what we expected.Its nice attempt.In fact somewhere inbetween guide also shares their disappointment over not getting recognised by Karnataka government but having recognition of Goa administration.May be we anticipated more!In some 20 odd rooms that wax museum mainly showcases musical instruments from many part of the world.Its a ok visit for ticket which is expensive than palace & zoo.Definitely worth a skip!!On the way back, we were little unlucky to have met couple of wrong auto drivers.First one left us midway citing gas issues and 2nd one charged us little above.But at the end we reached safely back to hotel which was more important.That night also dinner was in the room.Like last few days we finished around 10 pm, pattern away from what we have at home and went to sleep.

Itineraty for next day involved places which were little far from the hotel, namely Chamundi Hill and Vrindavan Gardens.A bird sanctuary on the way was also on the list.Musical fountains at Vrindavan were main attractions and it starts only around 7 pm so considering time & distance we hired a cab for the day for rent of INR 1000.First up was Chamundi Hills..Considered to be one of the most sacred places in India, its believed that demon Mahishasur was killed by Goddess Amba on this hill.Drivers will also tell you some more local stories about the place & its legend on the way.Must say that roads to the top are steady and good.On top you get to visit Goddess Amba temple and see big stautes of Mahishasur & Nandi.These 2 along with Palace are often potrayed as iconic symbols of Mysore.There is car park few meters away from the temple.On the way you have small shops to pick up some local stuff.Temple on Friday is typically overcrowded but we were lucky to get only a few in the queue.We offered our prayers to local god & seeked her blessings.Temple is old but well maintained and has imprint of Karnataka style architecture.We left but not without clicking few snaps of iconic Mahishasur & Nandi.Our driver for the day was also a good guide and family friendly person.He was keen to share some local knowledge which helps us enjoy the day better.From there we stopped at Government recognised shop called ""Kavery Emporium"" in main city.Purpose was to buy ""Chandan"".Every second name of place/shop in Mysore will have ""Kavery"" in it for obvious reasons that its their main river and which is also in the news over dispute over its water sharing with neighbouring Tamilnadu.At Kavery we bought another dress for Nam & a small stick of Chandan.Its always better to shop Chandan from Govt shop over anything else.Crossing thru the roads of main city, we then halted at ""Pizza Hut"".We have learned from our mistake in Ooty and have made it clear to Driver that we only wanted to eat at Pizza Hut if they have it there and our local professional knew where it was.He also took a halt at locally famous ""Mahalaxmi Sweets"" shop where we picked up local favourate ""Mysore Pak"" and some chivda.Chicken Pizza Meal at Pizza hut was stomouchfull so from there we continued our travel towards bird Sanctuary.Its a little off from the main Mysore-Bangalore highway but definitely a good stop over for those who enjoy being close to nature.Surrounded by farms & perched a little high, this bird sanctuary has a small lake within and that lake has handful of islands which hundreds of birds have made their home.Small pathway to walk along the lake offers nice views and cool breeze in the shadow of high trees.It also has couple of observation decks for bird watchers.We could not locate as many varieties of birds as one would expect but it was nice lazy stopover post lunch in the lap of nature!Lot of butterflies to watch as well!It was around 4 pm now & per driver we were on time to visit world famous Vrindavan Garden.It was around 45 mins drive from Sanctuary.Its easily the biggest crowd puller in Mysore and you can make it from the parking area there.It reminds you of parking spaces in US.Can easily accomodate more than 2000 cars i believe.Tickets are reasonably priced at INR 50 in spite of being such a big crowd puller.Designed beautifully using the waters of Kavery Dam,Garden hosts number of eyepleasing fountains which creates wonderful impressions on our mind.Water brings life & energy and when that energy springs from a fountain its a sight to watch!You have not 1 or 2 but atleast more than a dozen fountains all creating different designs in the air.There are 2 sides to the garden.One of the left is a step like structure which takes you on top of level of the gardens.There is a beautiful Krishna statue.View from top is simply amazing.Hats off to those who designed this.One has to be really fortunate not to have too many visitors there so as to have nice clean pics and we were sort of lucky.We were ahead of the group which consist of mostly school children.Only mistake that we did was to allow a starnger , who was also slightly drunk to click our pictures.Not only his clicks were bad but we also ended up paying him 50 bucks for nothing.Lesson learned - Never give your camera to stangers!!

In the early evening people start gathering by the musical fountain area which is on thr right hand side of the garden.It had high expectations from us but when we saw it actually, it didnt turn out to be anything that exciting.Firstly the show didnt started on time and due to lack of commentary, people were uncertain what to watch out for as novelty.We stayed for some time and then moved on as it was getting dark and it was out in open.By around 8 pm we came out and within an hour or so we were back at the hotel.That night as well we ordered the food in the room.Had food and went to sleep.

Next day was the day of return journey to Mumbai.We packed our bags,had breakfast and left Jade Gardens around 11.15 am.Our flight was from Bangalore which is around 4 hour travel by car from Mysore.We left aiming to reach Bangalore airport by 4 pm, couple of hours ahead of our scheduled departure of 630 pm.Journey was long but Mysore-Bangalore state highway is good road.We kept the same driver as previous day so it was safe as well.This time we stopped at places of our choice for food and breaks.You have Mac & CCD on the way.We stopped there.Sai as well had a decent time.By 430 we reached airport.Checked in.There was lot of time.Me & Sai explored the airport playing around.BOught some books for self & Nikhil at Airport book shop.Fortunately the flight was on time as well.After a decent 60-70 mins, we landed in Mumbai.Hired Meru at the airport and back we were in our sweet home.

This was our 4th tour of the year 2012.We were indeed making up for the lost year in 2011.We are now really settling down in our own pattern of travel.Good stay,good food, leisure , safety and comfort over anything else.Most importantly no rush for sightseeing.These changes were really making our travel a story to remember for long long time in our lives.Top experiences of this tour were -
1) Stay at Sunvalley Homestay - I doubt you will get a better choice in Ooty/Conoor.
2) Mysore Zoo visit - Its defenitely one of the better kept zoo's in India.
3) Toy Train journey from Conoor to Ooty in World Heritage sight.If possible make it in day time to enjoy surroundings.
4) Vrindavan Gardens - It can be better maintained but still has enough charm of its own.
5) SIMS Park in Conoor.Scores over Ooty Botanical Gardens.Both are same concenpts but Conoor's is better.
6) Walk in the Bamboo jungle in ooty.
7) Pykara Lake
8) Krihsnadevrai Bird Sanctuary in Mysore.
9) Chamumdi Hills Area in Mysore
10) Shopping in Mysore.

Madurai - palais, grande cour
On a quitte Rameswaran en taxi encore car l'horaire du bus ne nous convenait pas (et le prix était très raisonnable, 50 $ pour 3 personnes 165 km). Madurai est une grade ville, approx. 1,3 millions habitants. Bruyante, poussiéreuse, mais il fallait visiter le fameux temple de la ""Déesse aux yeux de poisson"". Nous sommes d'abord allés au palis royal, belle surpsise car il a une grande cour avec des sculptures sur les fronton et une salle de danse magnifique.
Quand nous sommes arrives au temple nous n'avons pas regrette d'être venus, en dépit du fait que nous n'avons pas eu le droit d'entrer dans l'autel de la déesse ni dans celui de son consort. Mais, encore une fois, c'est un complexe de temples, de colonnes sculptées, un grand tank d'ablution (pour la première fois il est bien entretenu et entouré de fleurs). A l'heure de puja (cérémonies de prière) il y a la musique (3 musiciens avec une trompette spéciale, une tabla et un sitar). Nous sommes restes longtemps assis sur des marches a écouter la musique, s'imprégner de l'ambiance, admirer les statues superbes. Et puis nous avons flâné dans les rues bazar en route vers notre hôtel qu'on

Thanjavur - Grand temple
Nous sommes impressionnes par le nombre de collèges et universités rencontrées. Il y a aussi beaucoup de bus scolaires et les jeunes étudiants aiment bien parler anglais (des fois ils nous demandent aussi de mots en français, les indiens sont très doués pour les langues). Malheureusemnt on nous dit que ce n'est pas tellement le souci d'éduquer qu'une superbe affaire (blanchissement d'argent!)
Nous avons pris une seule fois un bus A/C mais il était bonde alors nous avons du rester debout. Les autres fois nous avons pris les bus A/I (air India, sans portes ni fenêtres) avec les locaux. Fort sympathique car les gens sont gentils, curieux et entrent facilement en contact. THANJAVURc'est l'ancienne capitale de l'empire chola. Grande métropole a l'époque (VIII-XVs). Le palais royal est plus récent, XVIIIs et pas mal en ruines, mais il y a une collection impressionnante de statues en bronze du XI-XII s. En arrivant au Grand Temple on est rentres dans une autre époque. Un énorme complexe de
Thanjavur - le soir au Grand Temple
plusieurs temples dans une cour immense entourée de remparts et d'un beau jardin tranquille. Les gens viennent ici tous les soirs pour la cérémonie religieuse et si on habitait cette ville on viendrait nous aussi. Nous restons longtemps assis sur des marches a regarder les gens habilles en saris et dotis, a jaser avec eux, en écoutant la musique religieuse, embaumes par le parfum de l'encens. La pleine lune rend l'atmosphère encore plus magique. Nous revenons a chaque soir mais nous devons attendre la visite du matin pour pouvoir entrer dans les temples car le soir c'est une foule incroyable. Nous nous arrachons au charme de cette autre époque pour continuer la route versTIRUCHIRAPPALLIautre grande ville de l'empire chola, appelée intimement Trichy. Nous prenons le bus pour aller sur une île au nord de la ville ou se trouvent les temples. Le premier,le ""petit"" Tiruvanaik-kaval, a des piliers avec des sculptures magnifiques. Mais le complexe de Srirangam, le plus grand au pays, nous laisse bouche-bée! Sept cours concentriques chacune avec plusieurs temples, celui
Thanjavur - ancien palais
de milieu avcec un toit dore (comme d'habitude). Les gopuras (tous) sont incroyables, la majorité avec des statues en stucco colore par dessus, quelques unes ivoire et une moderne avec des figures géométriques. Il y a aussi une ""salle a mille piliers"" et d'autres sculptures fabuleuses sur des piliers, mais la nuit tombe et nous ne pouvons plus admirer les détail. L'atmosphère a l'entrée du temple est pas mal chaotique, les vendeurs de fleurs et objets de culte, des objets en cuivre, les rikshaws, les tuk-tuk, les fidèles et les brahmins se mélangent tous dans un tourbillon de couleurs, odeurs et bruits. Nous prenons le bus pour rentrer a l'hôtel, un autre spectacle ahurissant en traversant le bazar. Le lendemain matin on part a 6 h vers le Rock Fort, un temple niche en haut d'une immense roche de 3,8 milliards d'années (parmi les plus vieilles au monde) qu'on visite a jeun en grimpant les 437 marches qui montent au sommet. Le brouillard matinal nous empêche de voir clairement les temples sur l'île du nord mais l'atmosphère est quand-mémé impressionnante.On quitte la

ville a 10 h transformes en touristes ""de luxe"". Nous avons pris un taxi qui va nous déposer a RAMESWARAMla 2e ville la plus sainte au pays, après Varanasi.Depuis quelques temps nous faisons notre circuit avec le TTDC (ministère du tourisme de Tamil Nadu) et logeons dans ses hôtels (très bien situes mais un tantinet délabrés) Le TTDC nous a fourni donc un taxi A/C qui va nous conduire sur 265 km ( 5 heures au lieu de 8 heures en bus!). L'avantage est que nous pouvons arrêter en route pour visiter un autre endroit extraordinaire, le temple creuse en roche a Thirumayam. Les sculptures des piliers sont encore superbes et le brahmin du temple nous permet d'entrer pour admirer la sculpture en roche qui couvre le mur du fond du temple, représentant une histoire de dieux et couverte d'encre noire!Nous profitons aussi pour arrêter dans le village de Karaikkudi, renomme pour les manoirs riches du XVIII-XIXs que malheureusement nous n'avons pas pu visiter
Thanjavur - soir de pleine lune
atmosphere intemporelle au Grand temple
car les propriétaires habitent la et ne sont pas prêt a ouvrir leurs maisons aux inconnus.Ramesvaran est le ""bout du monde"" pour les indiens car il est au point le plus sud-est de l'Inde, a 18 km de Sri-Lanka (la légende dit que Rama a jeté un pont ici). C'est vraiment une ville de pèlerins, il y a juste des hôtels pour eux, et le notre (du TTDC) qui est au bord de la mer dans un grand jardin. Nous visitons le temple le soir en regardant les pèlerins qui se baignent tout habilles dans la mer ""sacrée"" pour se purifier. Au temple ily a aussi 22 puits ou les pelerins se baignent mais ce c'est pas possible pour nous.
Le l30 janvier c'est l'anniverssaire d'Antoine alors nous partons dans une aventure: nous prenons un jeep de TTDC qui nous emmène a la pointe extrême de cette lange de sable, sur un chemin creuse dans le sable par les roues des chars (comme sur l'île Fraser en Australie!). En fait il y a déjà eu une voie ferrée et une route qui
Trichy - temple Tiruvakanoil
menaient au petit village de pécheurs Dhanuskodi, mais le tout a été détruit par le cyclone de 1964!!!! Rien refait depuis. Le village est une ruine (l'église, l'école, la gare) et les maisons des pécheurs sont toutes en paille. C'est désolant et impressionnant!
Après un déjeuner au bananes et melon d'eau, nous allons sur une colline d'où nous pouvons admirer le panorama des marécages, petites forets, maisons de pécheurs, et le temple au loin. La route est en train de se faire asphaltée, le tout ""a la main"" par des femmes qui transportent sur leur tête des chaudron d'asphalte!!!!Le soir, le repas d'anniversaire a lieu dans le village de pécheurs d'à cote, Olaikuda, chez Scott, jeune et beau pécheur qui parle très bien l'anglais. Les villageois sont romano-catholiques (d'ailleurs nous sommes étonnés par le nombre d'églises rencontre es). C'est un coin de paradis, une petite baie tranquille protégée par une barrière de corail qui les a d'ailleurs protégé du grand tsunami et d'autres cyclones. Scott est très gentil, il nous a attendu a mi-chemin et nous a conduit a la fin (car le sentier vers le village est pas très illumine). Les conditions de vie sont ancestrales. Ils pratique la

pêche traditionnelle et gagnent très peu. Mais il semblent heureux et ne veulent pas quitter leur façon de vie. Il y a beaucoup d'européens qui vient passer les vacances dans leur village pour profiter de ce petit paradis. Nous avons aussi profite un peu.

Dear Grace and Mag,

The over night train form Kerala to Chennai wasn't too bad considering the only tickets left were 3rd class. There was a teeny compartment with 6 beds three on each wall. It was cosy but quite good.

When we got to Chennai it was sooo busy at the station and it was huge so we couldn't find our hotel taxi. We ended up paying twice but hey, we got there. Didn't really like Chennai much although I am really glad I went there to see the contrast.

Stayed in the hotel most of the time though because going out was a bit of a hassel but the pool was dirty and really small. Inside the hotel itself was really nice though.

Some of these negative views are probably because I was beginnning to get nervous about flying to Thailand on my own and leaving dad but I didn't get a good vibe from Chennai, none the less.

Pondicherry - Antoine est aussi beni!
Les gens sont tres gentils, ils retournent volontairement nos sourires et nous avons toujours la cote avec eux car ils veulent souvent se faire photografier avec nous.

Les routes dans Tamil Nadu sont assez bonnes, verdoyantes, voutees par des grands, vieux arbres. Elles traversent des risieres et des cours d'eau, passent a cote des etangs aux lotus fuchsia et des villages pauvres avec des maisons couvertes de toits de pailles. Les deplacements ne sont pas toujours aussi ""excitantes"" que notre premier volet, car par apres on a eu des chauffeurs tres prudents.

PONDICHERRY

Heureusement la ville n'est pas aussi ""francaise"" que je la craignais. Nous habitions la partie tamoul, dans une residence tres propre sur une petite rue tranquille. Tout est facile d'acces a pied. En arrivant, Huguette a eu l'inspiration divine de nous conduire vers un temple hindu dedie a Nandi, le taureau de Shiva. On est arrives juste a temps pour la ceremonie de ""lavage"": on verse plusieurs vase (en argent) d'eau sur le taureau, par apres de l'eau avec de la poudre de santal (qui la rend jaune), et on fini par un autre lavage a eau. Des dizaines de guirlandes de fleurs embaumees sont
Pondicherry - eglise Sacre-Coeur
ensuite arrangees autour du cou et des cornes de Nandi. Tout est baigne par une musique envoutante qui nous transporte. On se regarde heureux et apaises.

On continue par une courte visite a l'ashram de Sri Aurobindo (il a d'ailleurs construit un centre mondial de la meditation pas loin de Pondicherry mais nous n'avons pas le temps d'y aller car il faudrait rester plusieurs jours). L'atmosphere est florale et paisible. Le soir on retourne au temple de Nandi pour assister a la ceremonie de soir pendant laquelle on enleve les guirlandes de fleurs et on les donne en petits morceaux aux fideles.

On prend soin de notre estomac aussi car notre ame ne peut pas survivre sans nourriture terestre! A cote du bazar nous decouvrons un petit bui ou on mange de bons repas d'Inde du sud: pongal, dosai, parantha, halvua, puri... et j'en passe. Le cafe de la region est vraiment excellent!

On part tres excites vers

CHIDAMBARAM - cite du temple dedie a Shiva sous sa forme de Dieu de la danse, Nataraja. Si on etait venus en Inde juste pour voir ce temple et ca vallait le deplacement. Le complexe est immense avec
Chidambaram - cour du temple Shiva
Huguette, Antoine et fideles
plusieurs temples dedies a d'autres dieux hindus et un immense bassin d'ablution. La plupart des temples datent du IXs mais les fresques ont ete rajoutees plus tard, jusqu'au XVIIs. Nous visitons le complexe ebahis par la beaute et la finesse des sculptures et peintures. Mais quand nous entrons dans l'enceinte principale nos coeurs s'arretent emus! Un temple immense en carre, avec des colonnes monolythiques sculptees. A l'interieur deux autres temples, un en or l'autre en argent (c'est vrai, les portes, colonnes, vases, tout ce qui existe dans chaque temple est couvert par des plaques de metal cisele et sculpte!!!). La ceremonie du feu bat son plein. Des centaines de fideles autour de nous chantent. Nous vibrons au son des dizaines de cloches qui resonnent autour de nous. C'est dur a quitter tellement nous sommes ensorcelles! Mais nous revenons le lendemain matin pour assister a la ceremonie du matin et entrer dans le temple d'argent (Antoine torse nu) pour honorer Shiva. Il y a moins de monde mais l'atmosphere est aussi magique, avec le chant delicat d'une femme a cote de nous, la chaleur ensorcelante des feux et l'odeur enivrante de l'encens! Nous sommes conquis par Shiva.

Vous comprenez que

Cornelia entouree des fideles de Shiva
tous ces moments restent graves a jamais dans nos coeurs mais qu'il n'y a pas de phtotos car ce n'est pas un spectacle pour les touristes, c'est une vraie ceremonie religieuse sacree.

India 001
Today a group of German executives visited the school. They are some of the primary donors and came to meet the children and see the facilities.

These executives are from the same companies that sponsored the football (soccer) tournament to raise money for the school this past weekend. I am so glad that I went. It was wonderfully fun to support the students as they played and to ride on the bus home celebrating their victory. But the tournament had a strange feeling. I often felt like the students were asked there to perform. I sometimes felt like they were put on display. I suppose that this was helpful in raising money, but the objectification of it got to me. I don’t think the kids noticed, thankfully, but the volunteers spent much of the day glancing uncomfortably at each other. I don’t know where the school would be without cooperate sponsorships, but I wish it didn’t come at such a cost. I wish people could do good, without parading their beneficiaries around.

Before the executives visited today, I was asked to coach the students that would be talking to the visitors. I felt uncomfortable agreeing to do this, as
India 002
I think that they should not be told what to say. Nevertheless, I said yes, knowing that I could direct them as little or as much as I felt comfortable. I am so glad that I agreed. It was fun to talk with the children, to practice introductions, and to practice asking questions to the guests. They laughed at my fake German accent (which I didn’t do for the guests) and I laughed at their riddles and jokes.

Then the visitors arrived, there was a special assembly. The children sang. The adults spoke. And the flash of cameras lit the backs of heads. When one of the guests introduced himself, he said that every time he returns to Shanti Bhavan he feels like he is returning to paradise.

He is not the first to say this. Some of the volunteers have said similar things: This is like a tropical paradise. This heaven. If I filmed a movie of the book of Genesis, this would be the Garden of Eden. When dance students visited a few weeks ago, some of them said that Shanti Bhavan is better than the school they attended or that they wish they could have
India 003
gone here.

While I understand this—it is so beautiful here, and the school is good and full of good feelings—something about these statements make me feel uncomfortable. When I see the running water, the electricity, the well-roofed buildings, the tasty food… When I see all this, I can’t help but think of what is absent: the dung and palm shacks, the garbage, the crowded streets, the children in the puddles. If this is heaven, hell is certainly outside the gates.

I am so grateful for this school, and I don’t mean to demean the work being done here. It is a beautiful place is so many ways, not just because there are blooming flowers in January. But I feel that to call it heaven or to wish that you attended is to deny the achievement of the school and the humanity of the people responsible for its existence. Perhaps more important to me, I feel it denies these children their histories. These children have experienced more than I will in my lifetime. They have experienced more than a tropical paradise.

I have been harsh tonight. A few nights ago, my roommate asked me if I find it
India 004
hard to be around people. When I ask her what she meant, she said that I have such high morals and such high expectations of people that if she were me, she would hate everyone. I had never thought about this. I certainly don’t hate everyone. If any one. While I was disturbed by things at the soccer tournament and things today, I do trust that everyone present have the best intentions (perhaps with the exception of the commentator at the game, but that’s another story). I hope that this trust is not replaced completely by these criticisms.

Thankful for...

Buses full of happy children

I feel like I am becoming a contradiction to rival this country. Now that the shield of newness has lost its original strength, I am on a roller coaster of emotion. When I am playing with the children, or teaching, or talking with the volunteers I feel elated. I laugh so much in my classes, at meals, and at odd times throughout the day. But then I will be overwhelmed by sadness. I have cried in classes hit by the horrors addressed in the literature of the day. Today, frustrated for a series of reasons, I cried when another volunteer simply ask me what I thought of the meeting. But then a few minutes later, I will be overwhelmed by the joy of the children, the beauty of the place, the kindness of people around me.

People must think me crazy.

I am not unused to crying or laughing more than other people are, but I feel less grounded. Being here has made me more acutely sensitive. Writing helps. So does reading. But before today, I hadn’t really talked to anyone about my frustrations. I am so glad the volunteer ask his question, though I am not sure he knew what he was in for.



Thankful for...

People to talk to

Laughter and tears

Kanchipuram - Kailasanathar temple
KANCHIPURAM - est la ville la plus sacree de l'Inde du sud et la 2e ville plus sacree apres Varanasi! On ne pouvait evidemment pas la manquer. Ville typiquement indienne, chaotique, poussiereuse, avec traffic dementiel. On partage la route avec les vaches sacrees, les sacrees motos, les tuk-tuks, les voitures, les rickshaws, les bicycles, les chiens et les chevres! Pas de trottoirs! mais beaucoup de poussiere! Cependant, les temples! Nous avons visite 5. Le premier, Kailasanthar, date du VII siecle. En dehors de la ville, il se dresse au milieu d'un petit jardin paisible. Quel bonheur! Le mur exterieur contient 58 chapelles avec la figure de Nandi, le taureau sur lequel Shiva voyageait. Les sculptures exterieures sont magnifiques, gracieuses et detaillees. On attend 1 heure pour que la meditation qui se deroule a l'interieur finisse pour rentrer dedans. Pas completement, car les non-hindus n'ont pas accces dans l'autel. Mais nous jetons un coup d'oeil sur le lingam noir du lord Shiva, dieu de la destruction et de la reconstruction, de la danse et du sex (car son lingam est venere dans tous les temples qui y sont dedies).

Le lendemain on visite le temple Varadarajar. Dans sa cour une magnifique
Kanchipuram - sculptures a Kailasanathar
salle de marriage avec 96 pilliers monolythiques avec des sculptures erotiques (c'est ca le mariage!) inspirees de Kama Sutra. Superbe! Precieuses explications donnees par un brahmin de 10e generation, avec un brin d'humour et de debauche dans ses yeux!

On a quitte l'apres-midi avec un bus local. Chauffeur suicidaire et assassin!!!!! Personne ne resistait a son claxon pousse au fond pour depasser tout vehicule dans son chemin. Pendant le depassement les vehicules venant en sens inverse etaient quasiment pousses en dehors de la route pour ne pas se heurter a notre bus! Si on n'a pas fait de crise cardiaque ce jour-la c'est qu'on a le coeur solide. Notre beau et jeune chauffeur de bus devrait devenir pilote de courses, il serait excellent sur les circuits les plus fous!

MAMALLAPURAM - on est quand-meme arrives saints et saufs! Ooouf! On meritait un repos. Nous sommes donc alles habiter a l'exterieur de la ville dans un ""beach resort"" appartenant au gouvernement de l'etat. Grand parc au bord de la mer, arbres magnifiques, un jardin de sculptures, superbe piscine et plein d'oiseaux incroyables, pour rendre Huguette extatique, car elle est une grande amateur d'ornitologie! De notre chambre au premier etage
Kanchipuram - Varadarajar temple
d'une jolie maisonnette on voit et on entend la mer agitee. Malheureusement c'est impossible de se baigner car le tsunami a completement modifie la plage qui descend vertigineusement dans la mer et personne n'ose rentrer car les vagues et les courants sont tres forts. C'est quand-meme tres beau. Nous sommes chanceux car la temperature et tres agreable 30C le jour, 20C le soir, avec une brise permanente qui fait notre bonheur.

On est venus ici pour les caves sculptees et les ""rathas"", temples monolythiques erriges sur des plateformes commes des charriots. En plus, il y a une immense roche sculptee ""La descente de Gange"" avec des animaux, des personnages, des scenes de vie, hallucinante!Mais le clou de notre sejour a Mamallapuram est le festival de danse indienne! Chaque soir, sur la plage, devant un temple du VII siecle, des spectacles de danse classique indienne se deroulent de 17.30h a 21h! Nous sommes combles! La musique (et les musiciens) sont aussi fascinants que la danse. Les danseuses, tres belles, sont habilles dans des magnifiques costumes colores et scintillants. Nous quittons la ville avec regret. On aurait aime rester ici encore une semaine😊 Mais la route des pelerins nous attend.

We attended the lectures in the morning with the Prasad students. The first one, by Uma ma'am, was about religion and the role it plays in society. It was a comfortable and meandering kind of lecture, more of a discussion. At the end, I didn't feel there had been much of a specific point, other than just to open lines of communication.

After a chai break, the second lecture, by professor and cinematographer Sunny Joseph, was about different kinds of space in cinematography. He showed some examples of films with these kinds of spaces, like deep space, ambiguous space, flat space, and limited space. I realize there is so much more to learn.

At lunch I had butterflies in my stomach because Jayshree was coming with Nandini, also in the film, and they were going to see what we had made of their interviews. I was particularly nervous that the film is supposed to build up to the climax where she says she doesn't have children, and she looks a bit like she's trying to keep up the mask, and I was worried she would not like being publicly displayed like that.

They showed up, I just about swallowed my heart, and it was clear that they were nervous too. Ours was the first to screen, and I can't believe how fast my heart was beating. I feel like having a screening is like having an autopsy while you're still alive.

Once it was over, they asked us to stand in front of the group. We each had to describe our experience, and this is pretty much the last thing I wanted to do, but it was probably something really important to do, as well. It's no good to run from things that terrify you.

Basically, in that moment, I felt a tremendous appreciation for everyone and everything that had conspired to let me come here to do this project. Traveling and working on difficult projects are two things that jumpstart a person's self growth, and the two together are pretty fantastic.

Reading to children is one of the best things in the world.

Every night, volunteers read bedtime stories to the elementary-aged students. Last week I read picture books to the kindergarteners. The OSA has a great collection. Where the Wild Things Are, Blueberry Girl, There’s a Monster at the End of This Book, Rain Makes Applesauce, and others. This week I was assigned to the 4th graders. Another volunteer told me that this grade always complained that they had heard the stories before, so I decided to read Haroun and the Sea of Stories instead of several picture books.

The first night they were skeptical. When I arrived and told them what I would be reading, they cried noooooo, demanding that I instead tell them a story from my childhood. I promised that they would like this book, and told them that I was going to read it. They were…fairly quiet. Some were not very interested, whispering talking to their neighbor, until I reminded them to turn off their voices. At the end I ask them what they thought would happen next. They answered half-heartedly.

I told the other volunteers about their response. They asked if I was going to go give in and tell them stories about myself. I told them that I was committed, even if it meant a week of slightly frustrating evenings. Afterwards, as I prepared for the next day’s lesson on Macbeth, I wondered if stubbornness will turn out to be my tragic flaw.

Last night, I arrived at the 4th graders dorm with Haroun under my arm. Some of them grumbled that they couldn’t understand it. Another said that she would explain it to them after. I told them that they <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">all can understand it without explanation if they listen. When I ask what we read the night before, I was happy and (I must admit) surprised how much they remembered. Then I started to read. At first, they were restless again. But as I read, they became quieter and quieter. And by the end of the passage, as tears streamed down my face (the opening of the book is a bit sad), the whole class leaned forward, silently trying to catch every word.

It was magic: Seeing them drawn into the story. Seeing them forget that they were supposed to be bored and uninterested. Seeing everyone in a room sharing an experience.

When they asked why I was crying, I told them that it was because the story is sad at the beginning. But a more honest answer, I realize now, is that I cried because of the magic in the air. I felt so connected to the story, to the children, and to myself in those last minutes. And that feeling of connection was beautifully overwhelming.



<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Thankful for…

We are finished. Except I think we have to fix something with the credits, but we are done. We met at 8:30 this morning, and worked til maybe 7. Shweta had to leave at 6 because she had a show. She is a professional whistler and a singer. It was so painful today to cut more. I thought it was hard yesterday. We adopted a method, between Raj and myself, that when we disagreed, when one of us left the room, the other one directed Shweta to make the changes that we wanted. And if the other person didn't notice when they came back, those changes stayed. We knew more needed to be cut, it was just so hard to do it. I think this could be a slightly longer film. But directors always think so.

Did I mention the most wonderful music composed for our film in FIVE MINUTES by the brilliant young Hanees? He is such a joy to be around, and talented, only 18 years old. And such good timing. The guy who was supposed to compose for us had gotten so drunk that he was hung over all day and didn't come to school. So Hanees composed this, and a guitar guy just walked in the room and Hanees grabbed him, had him play it twice, recorded it, and that was it!

After Shweta left, we got a new editor for a bit, Manu. He is the only person I've had a bit of a hard time connecting with. I didn't like the titles he was making. They were too small and just popped up from nowhere. They felt disorganized. I said so. He said they were good. I asked if he always did it that way, he said yes. I said, may I just ask, what if we do something else. He said no. I left the room for a bit.

I thought it was an ego thing on my part. I am the director, blah blah, I want to do what I want. But when I was as objective as I could possibly be, the titles he made looked bad. Raj agreed, but Manu overrode him too. Finally, Manu just left. We were left to edit on our own, and though I felt bad, the first thing we did was change all the titles to a lower thirds type that were visible on all the backgrounds.

Tomorrow we screen! Jayshree is coming!

First I am so relieved that we've been given another day to edit! But I can feel the stress starting to set in with everyone. It is so so hard to cut at this point, tensions are running a little higher than usual, and we're all feeling it. Pradeep and Teja (producer) have been so kind and respectful, just popping in once in a while to say hi, Raj and Shweta have been dedicated, especially Shweta! What patience! I get frustrated with Umila at times because she hangs out with all the different groups and people, and just comes back and says, ""Why did you cut the sound and put space? That is so weird. So she's just going to talk and then stop? It won't sound good."" And it is frustrating to try to explain basics like that when we're on a time crunch. I hope I'm being nice but I know my annoyance comes out sometimes.

But like I said, we have one more day. We stayed til 9, so literally a 12 hour day. I am so into it, and people keep saying, just have fun, enjoy yourself, you can do films anytime, but when will you be in India again, with these people? Either I am a prude or anti-social or something, but I really want to work hard on this project. I feel like every project I've done before never reflects what I was trying to do, and part of wanting to go on this trip was to build up my confidence about filmmaking again, because I felt that my last film was so crappy that I didn't want to continue trying to make documentaries. I need to work hard so that I know if I really just am not good enough to do this.

My question is, how will we finish this by the end of tomorrow? It is not possible. I really like having a group for the purpose of working through ideas, and having sounding boards, but it takes so much longer to edit! I feel it will be worth it in the end,but if it was me alone, I would watch things again and again and again, and Shweta needs only to watch things once. Then she wants an answer about which clip to use. Really? How does she store all that info. Add to this the fact that my dear Raj came super late and then left super early to work on ""The Making Of"" credit animation, so I didn't feel like I could make decisions without checking with him. Our film was an hour last night, and tonight it got down to half an hour, so it's an improvement.

We went to a restaurant nearby for dinner, and I let the Indians order my food. I don't think there is anything I have eaten here that I haven't liked.

Hosur Temple 006
Shrine offerings for sale outside of the temple
It has been a while since I’ve written anything. I think this may be more of a weekend blog than a daily diary. (Just noticed that diary and dairy are so close in spelling.) So much has happened and I have so much to write about I don’t know where to start.

I feel more comfortable teaching. I am not sure how I will feel after a few more months, but right now, I could see myself becoming a classroom teacher in the States. At the beginning of the week, I was really frustrated with the standardized test my 12th graders are going to take soon. The test leaves very little room for varied interpretation of the literature and some of the interpretations for with the graders are looking are in my view incorrect or at least incomplete. I was also frustrated because I felt like my students were so worried about the test that they weren’t willing to think for themselves. When I gave them a writing exercise, they wanted be to tell them the right answer. But as the week went on, I started to enjoy the challenge of leading them to the answer the test graders want
Hosur Temple 007
without telling them what to write. I think I am getting better about asking questions to guild discussion, but it is difficult. I remember great admiration the ease with which professors of mine directed conversations in class.

Another volunteer arrived yesterday. She is from Puerto Rico and seems really lovely. With her arrival, we have five nationalities represented in the staff. There are the permanent Indian teachers and volunteers from the States, Russia, Scotland, and Puerto Rico (which I suppose is technically an unincorporated territory). It is wonderful to be in one place with people from so many countries. It is curious to hear people’s perspective on America and to hear about their norms and ideals. I have tended to resist the notion that people’s place is greatly reflective in their personality, actions, values, and so on. Here this tendency seems absurd. Being here and talking with students, teachers, and other volunteers has shown me just how “American” or at least how “Western” I am. There is even a noticeable difference between the volunteers from the east coast of the U.S. and those of us from else were in the country. It makes me wonder how I would be
Hosur Temple 008
different if I had grown up in New York, Russia, or India.

Today we went into Hosur again, but this time visited a temple on the top of a hill looking over the city. It was an interesting and powerful experience. When we arrived, we had to remove our shoes and leave them near the gate. Perhaps what I remember the most clearly is temperatures and textures my feet moved over as we walked to and through the temple. The exterior of the temple was elaborate and colorful. The interior was dark and mostly stone. While I am glad we went, it felt strange to be there, especially as a tourist. It felt like a violation to be there just to look and see something new, when people were there to pray. The people offering gifts at shrines or bowing before a deity seemed to be involved in such an intimate act (I think it seemed especially private, because I am used to corporal worship). And there I was with my backpack and water bottle, not sure of what I was supposed or not supposed to do.

The temple felt like a contradiction, though not an unfamiliar one.
Hosur Temple 009
It was beautiful: the stones and shrines carved with care, the bells chiming, the smell of burning oil. The dim lighting, the cold under my feet, the echoing of footsteps and whispered prayers. This all made the place seem sacred. And yet. Guide rails like those in a museum prevented visitors from approaching the main shrines. Priests alone could go near. And as I was in the holy place, feeling self conscious and unsure of proper decorum, I couldn’t help think of all the labor, resources, and money it cost to build such a temple. I couldn’t help but think of the naked child I saw bathing near her shack just below the temple. I was revisited by an unease I have felt when visiting cathedrals. I appreciate the beauty and the sanctity of a shared holy place, but I question the expense. When I exited the temple, I was struck by the prettiness of the blue sky, the pleasantness of the breeze, the songs of birds. I wonder sometimes why we need temples when we already have all that on top of the hill.

We went to the academy this morning. Who knew that just leaving for 5 days would make returning feel like coming home? Pradeep had logged and captured our footage, and Shweta was already at work naming the clips. Here we go! We were not allowed to do any actual editing until we had watched all our footage and submitted our final structure to the professors. Shweta hadn't seen the footage yet, though she was there on set, and since some group members didn't show up forever, it was hard to get stuff done because I didn't want to step on anyone's toes and take too much creative control, especially since I have a codirector.

We submitted the proposal, they accepted it, and we went back to the editing lab. I was so happy that Shweta had asked in advance for the editing lab II, which has much nicer computers, and specifically for the computer with FCP instead of Avid. She knows both, but she knew that I only knew FCP. We had the best best best computer, and I love my group.

P.S. I love franky rolls

The focus of the day for me was not what we actually did. Yes, we visited the shore temple, a beautiful limestone couple of monoliths, with features that have been pitted and erased of detail by the harsh sea air. Yes, it was beautiful. But for me, the focus was that I had a small existential crisis triggered by an audiobook I listened to on the bus, ""Beyond the Beautiful Forevers."" It describes the lives of people who live in the slum just outside the Mumbai airport, which was actually ""founded"" by immigrants from Tamil Nadu, who were construction workers working at the airport. One moment of the book I found particularly painful was the description of a little boy who worked as a trash collector. he'd then separate the recyclables. One day as he put recyclables into the machine, his hand got caught, and cut off. As he stood bleeding, he didn't scream. Instead, he apologized to the recycling plant owner. Apologized! And said, ""Sir, I won't complain. You won't have any further trouble from me."" WTF is wrong with this world.

Listening to this, and then seeing our American students complaining about the A/C bus and substantial food, while passing and ignoring a slew of beggars, I felt sick to my stomach, and not because of the food. Seeing other Americans is like seeing myself from an outsider's point of view. I feel so powerless to change what exists. I am one person, and right now, I feel like a leaf in a river. This river has been flowing for a long time. Who am I to judge its course, and who am I to try and change it? But this river is a reflection of the social disease in our global culture. Money is power, power is value, the poor are considered worthless, and everyone believes it, even them.

I want to return here in April, after I travel, and make another documentary.

We took a bus for 30 min. (We joke that everything is 30 min, but in reality is always longer.) We left our hotel in Pondicherry, and arrived at Auroville, the intentional community, that describes itself as ""an emerging international township dedicated to the ideal of Human Unity."" A path led us past a self-cleaning water treatment system, through trees, with sections of shade built for comfort, to this utopian villa of all kinds of people. I saw women in burquas, backpackers with dredlocks, locals in local clothing, and elderly couples in sandals. We stopped in for a 10 minute informative video, which had me chomping at the bit to get inside to magical golden globe half a km away, start concentrating or meditating or whatever, the interior of which is painted white with white carpet and white spherical insides and a big crystal in the center which has a beam of sunlight channeled and reflected onto it with a series of mirrors. Finally! Inner peace and success and focus, at this idyllic center for all things good! We stopped, as always for tea, and headed out to the globe, which is called the Matrimandir.

Along the way, I had a fascinating conversation with the Dr and a few others about the concept of eunuchs, or hermaphrodites. They apparently have a bit of a supernatural or religious vibe about them. She explained that there is one day a year, during which all the eunuchs get together and spend a long time preparing themselves, purifying themselves, and getting ready like they are getting married. Then on the day of this festival of sorts, women send their husbands to them, and they engage in a massive anal sex orgy. Yes, women actually send their husbands to have sex with hermaphrodites. It is considered a blessing. The following day, once the men have gone home, the eunuchs grieve as if their husbands have died. It is considered terrible luck to come across a eunuch on this day of grieving, and everyone avoids them.

I was wondering about this concept of hermaphrodites, because I know that in Thailand, the kathooey is considered to have supernatural powers as well, and is even considered as a third sex. They tend to have jobs as prostitutes in both countries, but it is difficult to imagine how they can form loving lasting relationships.

We arrived at the viewing point for the Matrimandir. We could not enter because we would have had to apply to go inside a few days beforehand. Still there were dozens of people, foreigners and locals alike, standing and sitting at the viewing point and looking across at the golden globe, perhaps in hope of feeling some residual concentration from the crystal within the globe. The Dr spoke at length about religion in India, and afterwards, we sat in silent meditation. Some in our group were more interested in quoting movies they like, and when this started to piss me off, I tried to see it as just another distraction in this world, and it is not the distraction's fault that I can't concentrate, it is my responsibility to be strong enough to block out the distraction. In the end, I had to ask them to be quiet, and I tried to concentrate for a while more.

After lunch, we got in the bus and went to the Ashram that is connected to Auroville, and I got some time to meditate there. I don't know if I like meditation, but I think it's supposed to be good for you. And if my goal this year is to not worry, maybe I could make use of this. While I was sitting there though, I felt that I liked the Ashram a good bit better than Auroville. Even when I spoke with the Dr about it all during lunch, she said that the problem with Auroville was a lack of good management. I myself didn't like that the locals seemed totally separate from Auroville, even as it professed to be a utopia of no barriers. The Dr said that the locals who worked there didn't even really get the concept of Auroville. After a while, neither did I.

After the Ashram, we met at the beach. Actually, it was not a beach, but a rocky shore, but people were gathered there, as people gather at any shore, to look out at the water.

We got on our bus this morning (which is emblazoned with ""GLORY TO JESUS"" across the front windshield) and headed towards Pondicherry. After 4 hours of travel, we stopped at a temple, though we didn't go inside, so we could do some more shopping in the plentiful shops and stalls along the street. I got some tiny clay pots that you are supposed to put a bit of oil and a cotton wool wick, so they can burn like they do in the temples.

We got back on the bus for 2 hours, headed for a river bank where we could apparently wade inside. However, it turns out the bus driver took a wrong turn and wasn't able to take us to this particular riverside park, because the bridge for vehicular travel was a few km back, and the bridge ahead of us was intended only for motorcycles and very small cars and bicycles.

Exactly as Vinit was explaining this to us at the front of the bus, the bus lurched forward, and we found ourselves testing the structural integrity of this 1km long bridge, as well as the patience of people who couldn't cross from the other side until we had gotten all the way over. When I looked out the window of the bus, I couldn't even see the guard rail, I just saw straight all the way down to the shriveled river far below. When we looked out the front, the entire bridge was hardly wider than the width of the bus, and seemed impossibly long. This is not how I wanted to leave this world, but there was nothing to do but hold on and hope.

We did survive. Once we got to the park, I saw the children's playground, which is equally inhabited by human children and monkeys. Across the road is the river. We parked, and we walked down to a place where the steps lead straight into the river. This is no Ganges, but it was cool to see a river. The landscape of the river, with its flat water and occasional patches of land in the middle, was a welcome calm, especially on such a high energy trip with many people.

The Dr was the first in the water. She just dipped her feet in, but it was enough to make me desperately want to get in, heedless of the warnings about bacteria and everything else. I mean, if a doctor is inside, I can go, right? A note about the Dr: we all love her. We have already discussed that we will do anything she tells us. Her supernatural abilities to give meds to the sick ones on our trip, explain about Indian history and culture, and shoo the lecherous men away, have given her an aura of omnipotence, which we all seem to respect. The Dr's husband is another story. His abilities are more limited to talking your ear off, repeating himself, and, being hard of hearing, not answering the questions that you actually asked. However, he's also proving himself to be a bit of a rabble rouser and a mischeivous prankster. He goaded everyone for not going in the water, saying that I was the only bold one. He convinced me to go deeper into the water, up to my knees, until the Dr started screaming at him from the top of the stairs.

There was a round boat with a paddle at the edge of the shore (first step). Some people had caught fish and had left them in nets in the water, I assume just to keep them alive. I picked one up, for a picture, and when I put it down,the woman who owned these fish came shouting down the steps. Apparently I had put them down in a way that the fish could have escaped. I apologized, and she was very gracious.

If I had been alone, I would never have touched that net. My tentancy when traveling is to air on the side of caution, and not touch what isn't mine. But in a group, I AM bolder, and more rude. I suppose the same goes for most people.

After all the things we've done and visited, I would say that this stop was my favorite activity so far on this trip. These people we not expecting us, they didn't try to entertain us, they didn't try to sell anything to us, they were just living their everyday life and were kind enough to let us visit.

C'est la que nous avons trouve plus l'ame de la vile car la plage etait noire de monde, des locaux qui viennent passer la fin de la journee en bord de mer en piqueniquant et en se saucant dans l'eau.

Mais nous avons eu notre petit coin de ""paradis"" car le hostel de YWCA etait dasn un jardin paisible et verdoyant au nord de la ville. Il y a des jolies batisses (gare, mairie) de style plutot britannique. On avait hate de continuer la route!

Today we woke up and walked nearby to a place to catch a bus to a village festival. There are already 17 of us, but we were not the only ones going to this festival. There were two whole buses of foreigners going, all from various organized tours.

When we arrived, it was hot and sunny and so so bright. As we approached the village, welcomers gave us yellow flower leis, but instead of being round like our leis in Hawaii, they had an extra appendage of flowers hanging. These are the kind of leis reserved for the Gods. They are offered in shrines, and I learned that you are not even allowed to smell them, because the first whiff is meant to be for the Gods. Why were we given these leis? Either 1) to mark us as tourists, or 2) because God is in all of us, and you must worship the God in everyone.

There were dancers with the most elaborate makeup and costumes, men on stilts with horse costumes as if they were riding horseback, and drumming and music everywhere. We walked through the village towards to throbbing hub of action in the center, but along the way there were so many festively dressed people, I wanted to take pictures. And since this was a place where tourists are welcomed, we were assured it was ok to take pictures. Narrow winding roads. Women and children poking out from every doorway. A man who I think worked for this whole production adopted me at some point because I kept lagging behind. He'd point out more things for me to take pictures of.

In the center of the village was a space for performance in the round, surrounded by various forms of seating, from a thatch covered shady area with plastic chairs, to the sun-beated concrete. There were entirely too many people. This village had exceeded its maximum carrying capacity by 300%. Everyone was hot and anxious for the performances, and everyone with a camera was clammering for a good spot.

First were the men on stilts with fake horses, and following were women dancing with the same headdresses like the girls at the NGO, a clown/magician who did some magic tricks that were much too small scale for most of the crowd to see, though one thing he did was pull about a mile of colorful paper from his mouth. I enjoyed it, but I was tremendously overwhelmed by the crowd and the heat. And also by the fact that several times local people were kicked out of their seats so that I could sit down. NO! That is not ok. This is their celebration, and I am the visitor, so I should get to squeeze in wherever I can, but I should not be given special treatment. In some ways, the whole thing made me feel like I was a celebrity, but I was not sure what I had done to deserve such fame.

Speaking of fame, they made us but those headdresses on and dance with them. Then they realized we were not coordinated enough to do that, so they made us stand and get our picture taken.

I eventually went back to the part of the crowd where there was shade and zero visibility of the ""stage"", because I knew I was getting crazy sunburned. Some kids started talking to us, and one got interested in my purell hand sanitizer that I have hanging as a keychain. They thought it was food. I showed them how to put it in their hands and rub the hands together and then, to demonstrate that they are clean, to smell the hands. This brought on an onslaught of child purell obsession, which I could never have anticipated. Suddenly I was surrounded with children, holding their hands out, and I am sure they don't understand the purpose of it, other than to smell different. How do you explain, ""It kills 99% of germs"" to a village child in India? Especially when they don't speak English.

There was some kind of theatrical dance in which two people had massive head-masks painted pink with blond hair. I imagined they must be some representation of british, and I kept waiting for the beheading of one of them, followed by cheers from the audience, or something like this, but nothing happened.

At the end, we ate in a large room, on the floor, off of a banana leaf. We thought it would be a light lunch, but I was stuffed at the end. Before we left, they asked us to fill out a questionnaire about how they could improve the festival next year. WHAT? This festival is yours, not mine! Do what you want to do! That was crazy to me.

In the evening, we went to the huge temple, around which Madurai was built. It is so big, that once you enter the first gate, there is basically an entire city inside. Shops, restaurants, people's homes, everything. We went to a rooftop to see some of the towers with the beautiful late afternoon light. A bunch of people were suckered into buying things at exhorbitant prices.

Once we got inside, it was already dark. We had been devoured by mosquitos, and I got to see first hand some of the results of a culture that is sexually repressive. No sex til marriage is the official stance, and a group of men wearing black from another temple, which the Dr had warned us not to go near, were practically foaming at the mouth. As they lined up next to us, they each grasped the shoulders of the man in front of him, as if they had to hold on to something to refrain from pouncing. Even inside, as the Dr showed us statues of different goddesses with one hand, she waved away the men with the other hand. She just told them in Tamil, ""Go! Why are you standing there? You have seen enough!"" The men in our group took the responsibility of creating a barrier around us. This is doing little to foster my sense of feminist freedom. This is not a country where I feel I have much freedom. The only freedom I get is from the fact that I'm a foreigner, and thus don't play by the same rules. But never going somewhere alone at night, and accepting that I shouldn't, and rarely going anywhere alone during the day, is hard for me to swallow. I am accustomed to being able to go ANYWHERE alone.

Discomfort aside, what a beautiful temple! It was built 2000 years ago, and has never had a fresh coat of paint, and yet the entire interior and exterior are so magnificently painted in brilliant colors. As before, we were not permitted to go into the inner sanctum, being non-Hindus, but Vinit, the Dr, and Umila could go in, so we, exhausted by then, waited near the entrance to the sanctum. I feel like we did too much in one day, so I wasn't able to properly enjoy all of it, and I didn't enjoy all of it, but it's all part of the experience.

There are drawings I've been meaning to mention, in front of every doorway. They are done, I think, in chalk, with white chalk for the borders and colored chalk as filled in color decoration. Originally, they were done in rice flour. They were intended to keep bugs out of the house. But as time went on, they became popular more for the decorative aspect.

Today we got on our little tour bus (which we'll be keeping for the duration of our stay away from Chennai) and drove to an NGO. The bus ride was long and many of us fell asleep. I was glad to see a bit of the landscape, outside of cities, outside of expected tourism, and just see everyday life, if only from the window.

The NGO is run by a Catholic priest who was a bit of an activist, but got sick of the Church telling him he couldn't rock the boat, so he started this NGO to create tomorrow's leaders, who themselves will rock the boat. We had thought we were going to see an orphanage, but a lot of the people there, mostly girls, were not orphans, but from a poor family, and this school gave them opportunities they wouldn't otherwise have. They were all of the lowest caste, the Dalits, once called ""untouchables"" but as the caste system has been morphing and changing and partially becoming obsolete, the Dalits have begun to gather their strength and political power and there is now the equivalent of Affirmative Action, and a certain percentage of all college acceptances MUST be Dalits.

When we first arrived, the priest himself spoke to us at length about his dream for this school. We were served chai, and soon after, a group of girls danced a traditional folk dance for us. One dance was with handkerchiefs, and the other was with large headdresses that looked like jugs balanced on their heads, and they would do all these things and never let the headdresses fall from their heads.

We then saw the recording studio, where many of these girls have recorded traditional music, and apparently this is the best, most sophisticated recording studio in Madurai. Several feature films have asked to use the recording studio, and they have only given permission to films that either are about Dalits, or star Dalits.

We had been given candy to give to the children, and none of us had passed it on to the children yet, so it was getting all warm in our hands. We saw some older children in the computer lab, and so we gave it to them. They played some music, and the girls started dancing again. Rikki made a little friend in a girl who wanted to specifically teach her to dance. Later on, we found out that these ""children"" that we had given candy to, that we thought were so cute because they wanted to teach us to dance, and had cute big dreams of being an aeronautical engineer, were actually 20 or 21 years old! The moment I found this out, I felt like such an idiot. How condescending I must have seemed! Why were we told they were children in an orphanage? Why were we given candy to give them? Why did they look so young?

After we left, we drove to a Monkey Temple. There were 3 gates decorated in the same multicolored style of many temples, and when we finally got to the top and parked, we took off our shoes and walked up to join the long line of people entering the temple. Since I'm not Hindu, I couldn't enter the inner part where people seemed to have some kind of water ceremony that looked like a baptism equivalent. As we stood, all around us we could see real monkeys. Just like the one I had seen in Chennai with the old lady. I felt cautious about taking too many pictures inside the temple, since it seems so voyeuristic and rude. One man shouted to me, and waved his hand. I wasn't sure if I should respond, because I figured he was going to yell at me. But when I looked over, he vigorously demanded that I take a picture of him.

After we left the temple, we discovered that we could feed the monkeys, so people bought bags of some kind of puffed rice, sold specifically for that purpose. The monkeys are much more in the know than any of us, and once they saw the bags, the bolder ones would attack the bag, which was made simply of newspaper, so it would burst and spill the contents on the ground. I got one to eat from my hand. Some of them were mean. Reflecting later, I realized all of them were mean. Really cute, strangely human, but not friendly.

Hello Wildcats!

I am writing from Shanti Bhavan, a school in the Tamil Nadu region of India. It is very warm here. Although I miss seeing your snowmen and playing with you in the snow, I must admit that I am glad that it is not below zero here. Instead it is warm, but it hasn't been too hot. A pleasant breeze keeps me cool.

There are palm trees and brightly colored flowers. A gecko sometimes finds her way into my bedroom, which is neat. She eats the insects and is quite cute. Other people here have seen snakes, but I have yet to see one. If I do, I'll let you know.

I think you would have fun playing with my students here. They like to play soccer and basketball. They have also taught me an Indian game I will teach you when I come home. You have to stack rocks while you avoid being tagged.

I don't think all of you would like the food. It is delicious, but more spicy than many of you would like. If you think the salsa from snack is too hot, than this food would definately be inedible. Even their breakfasts are spicy. I like it a lot, but sometimes wish I could have a pancake with syrup.

I hope you all had a wonderful winter break and are enjoying school. Although I am greatly enjoying my time here, I miss you all and am excited to see you again.

Keep your eyes open for a postcard in the next couple of weeks!

Yours,

Miss Jessie

What a lovely weekend. I am grateful for the extra day (today is a holiday in Tamil Nadu). Not because I had too much to do, but because I felt like I had to much to do. At the end of last week, having jumped straight into teaching, I felt a bit overwhelmed. Or at least behind. But after a weekend of exploring, rest, and planning, I feel better about the direction of my classes and my place here at the school.

I want to keep this post short, so here's the skinny...

Today was one of the volunteer's last day. This is her second time at Shanti Bhavan and she jsut visited a short time. It was lovely. One of the aunties--the caregivers to the students--dressed the volunteer in a beautiful sari. At assembly, the children spoke about her and gave her a card. It was wonderful to see so much happiness and love. But it was strange in a sense as well. It was strange to see an end at what feels like a beginning. I can't imagine what it must be like as a student always having teachers come and go. I think for them it becomes routine. But it certainly isn't routine for the volunteers. Volunteers come here to give to the students, to positively effect their lives. But I think it is the volunteer's whose life is really changed.

Meals were fittingly delicious for such a special day: At breakfast, fried egg and masala dosa--a crepe of sorts filled with spiced potatoes and onions, and covered with curry sauce. Dinner was fairly normal--curry, rice, and a beet relish--but there was also fresh vegetables in yogurt. So refreshing to have something cold and simple. Although I have greatly enjoyed the food, I have missed raw vegetables.

In the afternoon, I played basketball with the other volunteers and students. I don't know if I have ever had so much fun making a fool of myself. Afterwards, my roommate and I listened to The Decemberists as we changed for dinner. It felt good to move and sweat and laugh at myself. I think that I have been thinking so much about my classes and about my experience, I haven't been as silly as I want to be. From now on I hope to have a good serving of goofiness with my thoughfulness. And more music! I hadn't listened to music since I arrived, and I realized as I sang along how much I have missed it.



Thankful for...

Ends and beginnings

Yogurt

Athletic ineptitude

Music

It rained last night, by which I mean, it got so foggy that it made surfaces wet. It was beautiful this morning but somewhat eerie. The fog deepened all the colors and everything was heavy. As the fog lifted, it was as if the colors woke up after sleeping in. The soil is rust orange, the foliage rich green, and the flowers electric purples and pinks.

It was a lazy morning as I watched the colors come to life. I finished some grading and planned for a class. After breakfast, a group of us when into Hosur, a nearby town, by which I mean a city larger than Bozeman. It was my first time off campus since driving at night from the airport. We rode into town in auto-rickshaws, bumping our way down dirt roads and slowly whipping our way through traffic. What a way to be introduced to the countryside and an India town. Along the road, I saw families with two-year-olds on motorcycles (no minivans here!), trucks of caged chickens, and a woman standing in front of her lean-to shack texting on her cell phone.

Hosur was unlike any town I have seen. On our way from the shopping district to lunch, when got caught in a traffic jam that would make anyone grateful for rush hour in the states. Cars against rickshaw against motorcycle against pedestrian. My roommate said that she could make friends with the person in the adjacent vehicle; they were as close to her as I was. As we lurched our way through the packed streets, the my senses were bombarded. The smell of exhaust gave way to the smell of curry, which was then replaced by the pungent flower garlands hanging from shop canopies.

We browsed the stands selling clothes and a few volunteers bought school supplies. The fabrics were as vibrant as the city was fragrant. Textiles of very color imaginable stacked and hanging in the open shops. Although I would like some more Indian tops, I didn’t buy any. I felt overwhelmed by the street-side setting. I don’t much like buying clothes in the first place; so having to choose without trying them on, and with motorcycles and rickshaws zooming behind me was a lot to process. I think next time I go into town I will be more prepared for the experience. And hopefully able to be decisive without holding up the whole group.

After shopping we went to lunch. Some of the volunteers have been here for quite a long time already; they have been craving anything that isn’t curry and rice. So, we went to Pizza Korner, the Indian version of Pizza Hut. In addition to the American style toppings, they also had paneer, corn, and…curry. The pizza was tasty but different—slightly spongy and very sweet. We also each ordered dessert. Although I have been content with the sweet tea and a piece of chocolate a brought from home on occasion, it was lovely to have ice cream.

Next stop was the grocery store. Almost as congested as the streets at times, the narrow aisles has held both the familiar and unknown. There was nutella, Coca-Cola, and cornflakes, but also brands and items unknown to me. In addition to lotion and a small flashlight, I bought ThumbsUp, the Indian cola, and an almond milk drink. (The cola was good, a bit stronger than the colas in the U.S., with a slight bitter taste. The almond drink was too sweet, but the flavor was nice). Across the street was a fruit market. I bought a few kokosan, which I had tried earlier that day. It looks like a small kiwi crossed with a potato on the outside. Inside it is brown and fibrous. It is quite juicy and very sweet. I also bought a few teparee, which look like large gooseberries and which I have yet to try. I am not sure how they will taste, but I am excited to try something new.

Then we returned to campus to grading and then dinner, which surprisingly was pasta. They of course served rice and curry for those not interested in the Italian culinary experience, not that the dish was terribly Italian to begin with. The red sauce was more of a sweet and sour sauce, and the pasta had coconut in it. I certainly prefer the curry, but it was fun to try. As one of the students I ate with played with his food, he told me gratefully that tomorrow night they serve chicken (the only night of the week the children eat meat).

It was hard for me to settle down at the end of the day. So much newness set my mind in a whirl. I wonder how long it will take before more of what I see feels familiar or recognizable than foreign. Can a person reach that place in four months?

Thankful for..

An OSA who can tell me what a kokosan is

P.S. Pictures to come...

We left on the train to Madurai in the evening. We packed what we actually needed, which it seems is a fraction of all the stuff we actually brought, and piled into the bus, and off at the nearby train station. We had all been so thoroughly warned about bag-slashers, pick-pockets and all manner of thieves, it seemed like everyone was preparing to see the ""real India."" In reality, it was not a big deal. We even got to rest in an A/C room before the train arrived. This kind of separation from what the average person experiences actually frustrates me a lot. Yes, A/C is nice. But we are already Americans, and when I look to the Indian side, I feel like they are judging the rich Americans for parading around in their country with money and demands and a sense of entitlement. And when I look to the American side, I feel like everyone feels they are enduring a terrible misfortune because someone has a bug bite and someone can't buy a cold soda. If people want everything to be easy and comfortable, what business do they have coming to a third world country?

Our group was broken into three groups on different train cars. Ours was the only with no separating curtains, which I actually liked because if somebody is coming, you see them coming from a long way away. It was a triple bunk, and the middle bed folded down during daylight hours, to be the seat back of the passengers sitting on the bottom bunk.

I find that I have much more patience with something like a lack of facilities, than I do with people complaining about things that are not such a big deal. Cockroaches coming out of the cracks in the wall? They are tiny. I just killed them with my slipper. This is India, so shut up and deal with it. You can't expect 5 star accomadation to follow you like a protective capsule everywhere you go.

In the middle of the night, when I had to go to the bathroom, I wrestled with the idea because I didn't want to wake the person below me. Finally, I jumped down and went to the next car, where the bathroom is. Squat toilets on a moving train are a fun challenge. Figuring out how to flush them is even more fun. But when I was walking back to my own car, I paused to look out of the open doors at the landscape. The doors are either ajar or wide open during the whole ride, and when I say open, I mean there is nothing keeping you from jumping or falling out. No protective bars or chains.

The train had slowed a bit, so I peeked out cautiously, and then took hold of the yellow handles on either side of the door and leaned out to feel the wind and take a whiff of non-city night air. I saw people on the ground running toward the train. In the 3am darkness, it was difficult to see them, and I started to think I had imagined it all.

Yesterday was our second and last day of shooting. It was only yesterday but it already seems so long ago. We were at the academy by 9:30 to meet our crew and the hired van. Raj Kumar and I had each prepared some questions, and we got together and compiled a complete cohesive ordered list of questions for our main subject (Jayshree), her teacher-trainer, and her best friend. I was not sure how to approach the more personal topics, but I guess that's always the challenge: ask questions in a culturally and personally sensitive way, and encourage open honest answers, even in front of a camera.

We got there just in time for tea, and not long after, we set up our equipment upstairs to interview the teacher-trainer. this woman is in her late 60s, and the most lovely, distinguished, and yet casual lady you can imagine, with her silver hair and rich green sari. Her presence commands respect, and I automatically defaulted to calling her ""ma'am"" like the Indian crew memebers, and yet she'd ask, ""How do i look? Is my hair ok? I have no awareness of what I look like, so let me know."" She chatted comfortably with me, and off camera she agreed to tell me things about our main subject that she wouldn't on camera. This was fine. I'm not comfortable demanding personal information from her close friends, and then projecting it publicly. But it gave me better insight about Jayshree.

After this, we set up in Jayshree's office, and began the questions. Jayshree is open, but not completely so. It's hard to explain, like she has a public persona, and she is so giving, and clearly a bubbly person, but there was a little she wasn't quite sharing. I felt so bad when I got to the question about asking whether she had children, because I lost my place in the questions, and there was a big pause. She answered well, but it wasn't quite what I wanted. I struggle with the idea of how much I can ask the subject to repeat what they had told me before, or to repeat themselves with complete sentences.

Once we were finished with Jayshree's interview, we interviewed the coordinator, who is her best friend. We had only 6 minutes of tape left, so it was slightly rushed, but I think it will be nice.

When we finished, the crew got some lunch together. I think i've started to really get the hang of eating with only my right hand. Some of the crew is vegetarian, and some aren't, and when I asked about why, they said that it is because of their caste. The highest caste can't eat meat. The lower castes can. This lead to a fascinating discussion about the residual caste system, even if much of it is no longer an issue. In some places even now, a marriage between people of different castes will result in killing the couple. But in our group, Raj has a girlfriend (whom he intends to marry) of a different caste, and Shriram has a girlfriend (whom he intends to marry) who is Christian. Also, the original concept that caste would dictate profession and position in society is no longer in effect, at least in cities. These students are here all studying together, equally, and they say that a person of a lower caste can get a higher position in society. And yet some aspects are harder to shake, like whether or not they are permitted to eat meat.

Outside of the restaurant was a woman with a baby monkey on a leash. We took her picture and gave her money. Yes, I know it perpetuates this cruelty of trapping baby monkeys, or whatever it is they do. But sometimes it's ok to experience things without trying to change them.

On the van ride back, with becoming-common sounds of honking and the van driver's indian music, I had a strange but vaguely familiar feeling creep into me. It was happiness. Not relief, not escapism, not thrill, but just happiness. The kind where you let go of some kind of fear and just enjoy the honest satisfaction of the moment, the anti-thesis of stress. I feel that over the past 4 years I've been in NY, the stress of my daily life has increased and bit by bit has taken over and paralyzed sections of my spirit. My one and only new year's resolution was to worry less. I can honestly say that I have worried less since this year started than i did in an averge work day last year in NY. And now, here I was, doing pretty much all the things i love to do, simultaneously: traveling, working together with people and learning from them in a very open environment, and doing documentary work.

We took a break for a while and met up later to go to a school-funded party event at a nightclub. At first only a few people wanted to dance to the mix of american and indian club music, and the guys were told that men can't dance by themselves on the dancefloor, it's for couples only. but once we had gotten into it, there was no stopping the madness. It was a hilarious combination of demonstrating and copying eachothers' dance moves. Afterwards, in the auto-rickshaw, I had a nice conversation with (Essin?), who is Muslim, about culture and religion. I finished off the night with a lovely heart to heart with janardhan. The level of awesome of some of these guys is sickeningly high. I had a frustrating interaction with one American student, and he was there, and when we were alone, he said, ""but that's part of life!""

I've got to check out of the hotel in 10 minutes, so it's time for this post to end. We'll be traveling to Madurai and Pondicherry until the 19th. More to come.

A cow getting ready for the upcoming Pongol festival
I'm writing this entry as the sun slowly sets over Thanjavur on our last night in India. The locals are all engaged in a frantic rush of activity in anticipation for the upcoming three day harvest festival known as Pongol. People are stocking up on vast swathes of sugar cane and rice, paints are being bought to decorate one's doorstep and cows are being washed down and having their horns painted in all sorts of vibrant colours.

Having been on the move and engaging in various activities pretty well non-stop up until now, we were all quite looking forward to the opportunity of doing very little and recharging the proverbial batteries. Thus, we slowly made our way south from Cochi to spend a couple of relaxing days cruising the backwater canals of Kerala and doing exactly that – very little.

And indeed, our boat seemed to be designed for just such a purpose and was one of the best crafts that we came across – while most of the boats that cruise up and down the canals nowadays are made of fibre glass and steel, ours, the quite appropriately named, if not slightly twee, Dream Voyager, was a beautiful
Barges on the backwaters
barge made from imported Burmese teak and of the absolute highest quality. These boats were traditionally used as rice barges until some crafty local fella cottoned on to how much tourists would actually pay for a night on one of them and a massive industry suddenly exploded on to the sleepy Keralan backwaters. There are now apparently 500-plus such pleasure boats and as we pulled into what was literally peak hour on the main canal with barges back to back as far as the eye could see, we inwardly grimaced at what could easily be a quite crowded and unrelaxing few days. However, while most people just experience a day trip or overnighter, Ann, bless her, had had the foresight and wisdom to book us in for two nights which allowed us the freedom to quickly move away from the main highway and into the quieter and much more remote canals.

It was truly and absolutely blissful, lying around in easy chairs or sprawled on pillowed day-beds, reading and watching the countryside slowly drift by. Smaller canals branch off from the larger ones and little villages cluster on the edges, poking out from the rice paddies. There are no
The familymooners on the boat
roads and thus no cars, and each house has a small canoe tied up out front for transport. Everywhere, children frolicked in the water, men fished from little canoes and the women did the washing by vigorously scrubbing and then smacking the clothes on large rocks, the echoes of which continuously reverberated up and down the canals.

The birdlife was magnificent and as the sun slowly set behind the paddies, we relaxed over a beer and watched the eagles, kites, koels, herons, egrets, terns, cormorants, bee-eaters, cuckoos, drongos, swifts and of course the various species of the famous kingfishers for which India is renowned for, swoop and dart by.

The food, if possible, seemed to get even better as we were blessed with our very own Keralan masterchef who would begin chopping ingredients as the sun rose and continued in this manner for much of the day. He also had a delightful, if somewhat disconcerting, habit of hovering over us as we ate, poised with dish in hand to top up any particular delicacy the moment the last remnants had been eaten. While obviously none of us complained, it did have the result of meaning that we probably
Details on the gopuram
ate three times as much as was really necessary and it led to the quite comical yet equally perplexing issue of how to actually stop this bloke in order to prevent an ongoing and endless meal…

It was also lovely as we floated around to hear the various religious calls waft out over the water. A Hindu temple might begin, and as that faded in the distance, a mosque’s call to prayer would echo out over the fields. The local churches seemed to take the cake as they blasted out the Sunday morning psalms via massive speakers (eerily reminiscent of New Year’s Eve) so that you could literally hear it miles away – a sort of Christian version of bringing the mountain to Mohammed I suppose.

Alas, too quickly it was over and we ever so reluctantly disembarked and began a long day of driving up over the Ghats and back into Tamil Nadu and to the city of Madurai. From here on it was pretty well all about the temples, the only differences being the size, the number of faithful attending and the utter extravagance on show. The Sri Meenakshi temple is one of the three most
Tom & Beth receiving the Bollywood treatement
important in India and we spent an amazing morning wandering around it, taking in the massive gopurams that tower high over the complex and that are decorated with gods, goddesses, heroes and demons that are painted in bright, vivid colours. (Apparently they are touched up every twelve years and the process itself takes over a year.) We were repeatedly mobbed by pilgrims - especially blond-haired Beth, red-haired Tom and the towering 6ft 3 Jack, a figurative giant who looms over the locals. It was wonderful to just chat to the various devotees (again, occasionally about religion and life, but mostly about the cricket – India had just beaten arch-nemesis Pakistan in the last one dayer to finally notch up a win, so the local mood was much more jubilant) and to just take in the ablutions, prostrations and general devotions going on all around us. All through our trip, we’ve come across hundreds of pilgrims making their way to a particular temple, mostly shirtless ones wrapped in black dhotis with smears of ash on their foreheads and with large bells dangling from their necks but also clusters of red, yellow and green devotees, all heading to a specific
Pilgrims
temple somewhere - apparently around forty to fifty million of them hit the road each year). In the modern 21st century, most travel by bus, but the really devout will walk at least a large part of the pilgrimage and the truly virtuous ensure that they fast for the preceding month and a half as well. As we passed over the mountains, we’d spot clusters of these barefoot devotees slowly trudging along the side of the road, patiently going about their religious duties…

Despite small communities of Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains, Hinduism is the driving force in India and is such an integral part of the everyday life here and we’ve gradually learnt the very basics of the gods and goddesses and their countless incarnations. I won’t do the disservice of going into much detail where I would inevitably muddle things but generally speaking, there exists the holy trinity of Brahman, the creator, Vishnu, the preserver and Siva, the destroyer and their consorts. Then come the hundreds of offspring, aspects and so forth. An obvious favourite of the locals is Ganesh, the chubby elephant-headed god whose purpose is to clear life’s obstacles and hurdles and whose representation
Everyone's favourite little elephant God
is found absolutely everywhere - outside of houses, under trees, on the dashboards of buses and in countless other settings. While most gods have very strict instructions on how their temples are built – pillars need to be thus high, entrances facing this way, and so on, Ganesh is apparently pretty happy anywhere and requires very little in the way of absolute requirement, apparently even quite happy sitting on the side of a grubby road in the monsoonal rains…

After our morning templing, we headed north into the little village of Kothamangalam in the province of Chettinad and to the wonderfully restored Saratha Vilas. Early last century, the whole area was home to a host of rich Indian traders who made their fortunes trading and lending money across the British Empire and they had proceeded to build themselves these remarkably lavish mansions throughout the region. Inevitably they fell onto hard times and around a thousand of these decrepit and crumbling houses dot the landscape today. Saratha Vilas has been painstakingly restored by two French architects and decked out with wonderful local artefacts and icons, and is an incredibly beautiful and peaceful retreat well off the tourist trail. We happily
Pilgrim at the Brihadeeswarar Temple
based ourselves here for a couple of nights as we explored the countryside, visiting 6th century rock temples and the local tile-making village where we all stood astounded at the immense and complex skills of the local artisans as they created the most beautiful and elaborate tiles in mere moments. Of course Jane ‘suggested’ we buy a set and thus I have the unenviable task of lugging these massive concrete based tiles around Sri Lanka.

The region is also renowned for its large terracotta horses (quite interesting as we are yet to see an actual live horse in India) which are created for religious ceremonies each year and then deposited in a sort of horse graveyard where they slowly disintegrate back into the earth. It was actually a bit odd walking around the graveyard where these various headless, legless and even generally bodyless creations linger on. However, I was quite taken with these clay figures so this time I ‘suggested’ buying one, which Jane now has the pleasure of lugging around Sri Lanka…

Our final days in India were spent in the neighbouring towns of Thanjavur (otherwise known as Tanjore) and Tiruchirappalli (otherwise, thankfully, known as Trichy) again
Getting blessed
exploring various temples, including the biggest one in India where celebrations and festivals occur 320 days a year (except of course for the particular day that we visited), chatting to devotees and pilgrims and even being blessed by elephants. Peter had been recounting when they had previously been to Madurai and he’d been blessed by a giant pachyderm who he was hoping would remember him. Much to his, and indeed all of our disappointment, the animal in question was on his yearly 45-day retreat (as Tom grumbled, that was more than he gets annually) to obviously recharge his batteries and give his poor, overworked trunk a bit of a rest. However, in Tanjore as we wandered through the gates of the temple, we were fortunate enough to be met by a lovely elephant who proceeded to take our ten rupee note in her trunk, hand it off to the mahout and then blessed us with a nice, lingering kiss on the top of the head. Thankfully, I splashed out as apparently a mere two rupee donation is but a brief peck, denying the devotee the chance of a once-in-a-lifetime photo…

Our final stop was to visit the shores of the Kaveri River, which is the South Indian version of the mighty and holiest of holy Ganges. We’d paused here to witness the traditional dispersal of cremated ashes into the river and watched on as mourners with their heads ritually shaven sat with pates bowed as priests chanted blessings to ensure a safe passage of loved ones. Clouds of incense shrouded the area and bursts of colourful flowers dotted the pavement as families completed the process and sent their cherished ones on.

And that is pretty much that. A huge thankyou to Ann who had spent countless hours organising and fine-tuning this wonderful trip – full of great company, beautiful places and wonderful experiences. And to those who may have pondered the wisdom of spending a fortnight with the in-laws in what can be a sometimes challenging country, I can only say we’ve had a truly amazing time and all got along much better then could ever have been expected.

And an even bigger thankyou to the wonderful people we’ve met on this trip. The locals have been so friendly and welcoming and ever eager to help out, or just to pause and discuss life, and of course, the cricket. And while Tom and Beth now return home and Ann, Peter & Jack board the train north, Jane and I turn our sights south to Sri Lanka, where we’ll be swapping Ganesh for Buddha and the subtly flavoured curries for the eye-watering spicy ones. At least they’ll still want to talk about the cricket…

Murshidabad
'Palace of 1000 Doors'
It took around 2 months for us to travel from the Indo-Chinese border in Sikkim (or near as dammit) to the Southern tip of India.





We left the majesty of the Indian Himalayas and ventured down to the plains at Siliguri. This is a major transition from pure, clean air to diesel exhaust; from coats and jumpers to sweaty T-shirts; from friendly Nepalese and Tibetan folk to the more reserved, but staring, Hindu majority; from aging and overcrowded jeeps to, er, ancient and overcrowded buses. Somehow they seem much worse in the heat.



My plan was to travel to Kolkata in 4 easy steps, by bus.



The first step was to the town of Malda, chosen simply because it was on the way. Unfortunately our bus caught fire one hour out of Siliguri and we had to evacuate to the side of the road. A friendly fellow passenger took us under his wing and helped chuck our luggage on board as we joined the scrum for subsequent buses.



Malda seems a fairly typical Indian city. Big, loud, chaotic, plenty of cow dung. Adequate, but uninspiring hotels and
Kolkata
Victoria Memorial
restaurants. It grew on me a little as I wandered the streets away from the highway, where I bought a few essentials.



After another stressful and sweaty bus journey we were chucked off at the side of the road in Berhampore. The town looked ok, but we were disconcerted to find the bicycle rickshaw man taking us on a 45 minute trip down the hectic highway to get us to the recommended hotel. This hotel was nothing special, although the restaurant was good, located in a rotten area amongst the tyre changing and auto repair shops. There was nowhere to go for a walk without getting an unwanted lungful of diesel fumes.



We wanted to go to the nearby town of Murshidabad, which was supposedly rural and pleasant but after 20 minutes of standing by the roadside we realized that we were never going to be able to squeeze on any of the passing buses.



We returned to the hotel and hired a taxi for the day.



This turned out to be a good move because Murshidabad was rural, pleasant and spread out. We could not have got
Kolkata
Victoria Memorial
around it on foot.



There were a few things to see, the main one being the 'Palace of 1000 Doors' which was free to get in as ticket office was closed for Diwali.



At this point our general feeling was that the places we were visiting were not worth the effort required to get there, so we got up early to catch the 6am commuter train to Kolkata.



We had to stand for about half of the 3 hour trip, but at a ticket price of about 60p I still felt this was a bargain.



Despite being Indias second biggest city, Kolkata feels surprisingly un-chaotic and civilised compared to most Indian cities. There is enough room on the pavements and the hassle factor is much lower than expected.



For many this is a palpable relief after the rigours of the road and so Kolkata is generally proclaimed as the favourite of the big four cities amongst travellers.



In fact there is not a great deal to see.



The Victoria Memorial is a splendid white marble palace built in the
Kolkata
dog days of the Raj. It houses a decent collection of paintings and statues and access to a internal balcony high in the domed chamber, if you can find the stairs.



In contrast, the Calcutta Museum houses a threadbare collection that has not been updated since the 1960's. It shows that napthelene alone cannot quell the ravages of time upon the taxidermists art.



We rode the newly installed (ie - since I was last here) metro to the BBD Bagh area ostensably to look at the colonial era architecture, but primarily to pass a few hours in the foreigners railway ticket booking office.



The taxi ride to Howrah train station was not far, but was unexpectedly expensive as the driver created an argument and then drove off without giving me my change.







We took the
Kolkata
overnight train to Puri. I always seem to make the same mistake on overnight trains, which is to have a good meal before boarding so that I don't need to carry any food. I invariably end up in a compartment with a friendly family who are loaded with snacks that they insist on sharing, while I have nothing to offer in return. On this occasion there was copious peanut brittle and a peelable fruit that I have not seen before or since.



We got a decent nights sleep, arrived at about 7.30 am and headed straight for the Z Hotel.



I had been looking forward to this.



The Z Hotel is a former maharaja's mansion which has functioned a a backpackers favorite for many years. The high ceilings, thick walls and spacious communal area create a special atmosphere rarely found amongst budget accommodation. In 1990, I stayed in their dormitory of 4-poster beds and it has remained in my memory ever since. That cannot be said for many places.



So, we turned up and got a nice whitewashed room for 500 rupees (still cheap). At that point I
Puri
Fisherman's beach
did not realise how lucky we were because they were turning people away all the time. Talking to the staff, it turned out that they had all been working there for 25 or 30 years so I would have met them when I came here before.



I have to report that all is not well in Backpackistan. The Z Hotel have realised that if they install thick mattresses and air conditioning they can attract domestic tourists at 2500 - 3000 rupees a night. The conversion is currently underway.



The Z Hotel is away from the main area of Puri, close to a fishermans village. After breakfast we walked along the beach to see what was going on. Not a great idea at that time in the morning. The fishermans village is not endowed with a sanitation system so the population pop down to the high tide line to evacuate their bowels of a morning. This is routine so they are not shy about foreign tourists paddling by. A glorious collection of turds lies under the boat eaves waiting for high tide to come and collect them.



Passing the poo parade seemed
Puri
Fisherman's beach
like a perfect moment to cut my toe open on a random piece of wire, so I did.



I am not criticising this waste disposal method. It is provided by nature and has been going on since time immemorial. However, why the people choose to live amongst huge piles of their own domestic refuse was a bit of a puzzler.



From then on we walked along the beach in the opposite direction. It was about half an hour to the main town which has a really good beach.



Puri has an important Hindu temple and many come on pilgrimage. There is a long string of hotels along the seafront and hundreds of Indian tourists and pilgrims cluster along the waters edge. It is interesting to watch those who have never before seen the sea. To many it is a holy experience.



Every Indian crowd leaves its own litter signature. Walking along the seas edge in the afternoon there was always a plethora of cups and packets. In the morning the shore was nice and clean. I was never sure if this was the waves sweeping away the evidence
Puri
Lifeguards Headgear
or a secret army of litter pickers coming along and scavenging a few rupees from the recycling overlords.



A few steps along the crowds thin out considerably and I judged the waters clean enough to go surf diving a few times.



While we were there the Puri Dance Festival was taking place. We ventured forth one evening but found it difficult to get enthused about the entertainment. I think Indian dance culture has to be absorbed from an early age to be appreciated.



We eventually made our way to the temple, the Jagannath Mandir. It is in a large compound, closed to non-Hindus, so we could only walk around the outside. The perimeter is a combination of vegetable sellers, piles of vegetable waste and innumerable feral cows working their way through said waste. I have visited a lot of temples and this was the smelliest.



A few km's along the coast lies the small town of Konark, famous as the location of the Sun Temple. Built in the 13th Century the temple is a representation a huge stone chariot from a distance. Beautiful and impressive. From close up
Puri
one finds a striking array of erotic carvings of people involved in all sorts of activities. Many of the carvings remain in excellent condition. The ladies represented are both busty and gymnastic. A worthy day out.



The Konark International Dance Festival was taking place. 'World class, world class', enthused a local. Yeah, but it's still dance.



There was a friendly Indian guy named Rana also staying at the Z Hotel. He had a big car and one day gave a group of us a lift into Bhubaneswar, the major town a couple of hours away. This is one of India's Temple Cities, and we spent the day wandering around a number of temples from the 8th Century onwards.



We then spent a couple of hours trying to find a 'don't miss' restaurant which, it turned out, had been subsumed by a new mall development.



[News item: The Government is introducing fingerprint based bank accounts to enable the illiterate poor access to their welfare money. Unfortunately the fingerprint readers are unable to recognise about 50%!o(MISSING)f users due to the condition of their digits. Users are advised to apply

It transpired that Rana ran his own travel business and was travelling around India in a hiatus between clients. He had a two week period in which he planned to travel southwards and, yes, he would be happy to give us a lift. Cushti!



Actually, the forward planning between Puri and Chennai had been vexing me somewhat as it is a very large distance to cover with little of apparent interest on the way. Rana's offer was a Godsend.



Before heading South he wanted to head North. He has been all over India, but never to the Similipal National Park. We drove 8 hours to the adjacent town of Baripada and checked into a hotel. A park guide appeared, looking for business and things started to go downhill as I discerned the word 'problem' appearing with some regularity in the conversation.



It turns out that some Italian tourists had been kidnapped in the Park and held for a week by Moaist rebels. Foreigners were not now allowed in.

Puri
Main beach


'Don't worry', said Rana, 'we'll go to the Mayor'.



There is a feeling that anything is possible in India, so long as you talk to the right person.



We made our way to the local civic offices.



'You do the talking', said Rana.



'Tell him how much trouble you have gone to to get here, how keen you are to see the Park and how grateful you would be if he could see his way clear to helping us. Make him feel important and want to show his authority by letting you into the Park', he said.



Amazingly, we were ushered into the Mayors office. A flunky stood behind his shoulder passing endless documents to be signed off as he spoke and listened.



I couldn't get a word in edgeways as Rana launched into a spiel in their common language. There was some discussion before the Mayor finally turned to me.



'I am sorry I cannot allow you into the Park', he said. 'The rules have been made, it is not for me to change them'.

Puri
Beach procession


Having come up to speed on the Maoist situation I was not too disappointed.



'Come on' said Rana, as we exited the compound,' lets give The Governor a try. You do the talking this time'.



So we found ourselves standing outside the Gubernatorial mansion trying to get an audience through the intercom security system.



The Governor declined to see us.



The next day Rana and the guide went to the Park while we acquainted ourselves with the town (which didn't take long). He returned at 4pm having not seen a single animal.

'It's great if you like trees' he said.









We spent the night in the small seaside town of Chandipur. The sea here recedes 4km at low tide so there is either a
Konark
Sun Temple
huge beach and no sea or a high tide and no beach. We witnessed both conditions.



The Chandipur Dance Festival was taking place. A young group of gymnasts were getting changed in some rooms adjacent to our dinner table. We had our photos taken with them doing handstands and then watched them doing their routine on the big stage by the beach.



The next day was a long drive south to Gopalpur-on-sea. This is an Indian version of the fading seaside town you can find all over England. We took a sea facing room close to the waters edge, within earshot of the waves breaking on the beach. Linda killed the Worlds Biggest Cockroach in our room.



We sat on the veranda drinking beer as the waves crashed in.



I woke up early and took a long walk along the best beach of the trip.



We could have stayed there a couple of days but Rana wanted to move on.



Next stop Visakhapatnam, helpfully known as Vizag. This accommodation in this city has a reputation for being either cheap and nasty in
Konark
Sun Temple
the city centre, or high-class and expensive along the beach road. Arriving by car gave us a distinct advantage here, as we approached along the aptly named Beach Road and never got to see the city centre. The first few hotels we tried were either full or expensive, but we soon found a nice place about 3 streets back from the promenade.



The Young Ghandi Festival was taking place. Thousands of kids were dressed up as the old Ghandi, with glasses, false moustache and walking stick and then walked around for a bit. It was the first time that I've noticed a similarity between Mahatma Ghandi and Charlie Chaplain.



It was Saturday night and the promenade was teeming with people creating quite a vibrant atmosphere.



We could have stayed there a couple of days but Rana wanted to move on.



Rana asked us to come up with a list of our top 5 all time songs for a play list he is creating.

For the record, the 5 songs I provided were:



White Wedding by Billy Idol

Brickbat by Billy Bragg
Wedding Car


I Live In The City by The Humans

As Long As I Have You by Elvis Presley

Sunshine On Neath by The Proclaimers



Bet you don't know all five.







The next day was a long drive to Ongole. We stopped for a KFC at Vijayawada, where an overenthusiastic elderly lady beggar drove me into a low wall, cutting my leg. I've needed plenty of antiseptic cream on this trip.



Finally we drove down to Chennai. By now we had decided to bypass the city itself and Rana dropped us in the resort town of Mamallapuram a little further down the coast.



We had been in the car with Rana for 6 days and covered over 1500 kilometres, yet he refused to take a single rupee from us for fuel expenses. We had bought him dinner a couple of times but he was not even comfortable with that. Beer he would accept.



He runs a successful company providing adventure travel to sports enthusiasts from around the world:

www.goadventuresports.com.

The least I could do is
Bhubaneswar temple
to post a link.



Driving at car level on the Indian highways was an experience in itself. I could write a whole post about some of the mad behaviour we saw. Behaviour that would be shown on the 6 O'Clock News at home is routine here. A lack of Road Sense and Common Sense combine to often lethal effect.



Rana loved driving. I think it was because it was like playing a video game in real life, pitting your wits against the random and unexpected.





Mamallapuram is a pleasant enough seaside town. The beach is nothing special but the town has developed its holiday niche mainly through being a short drive from Chennai. We didn't expect to spend 2 weeks there but the days slipped by and suddenly it was too near to Christmas to move on. We had a nice room with a balcony and an array of decent restaurants within a stone's throw.



This is another place with a collection of ancient temples. We only bothered with the free ones which are in a parkland area behind the main road. Also in this park
Puri
Z Hotel
is the Butterball, a strangely named giant stone sitting at a precarious angle on a slope. It looks like it should roll away but of course it has been there for millennia.



Christmas came and I was disappointed to note that none of the restaurants within a stones throw were offering a Christmas dinner, although there were plenty of Westerners around. Thankfully a posh restaurant on the edge of town was doing a turkey dinner at a not extortionate price, so we treated ourselves on Christmas Day.



The restaurant was full - with Indians eating curry. We were the only white people there and the only ones having turkey.



We spoke with the owner. She was wondering what to do with all the turkeys she was going to have left over.

At least we got big portions, and it was only mildly currified.



The Mamallapuram dance festival was taking place. At least it was supposed to be. The posters said it started on the 25th December, but when we and a few thousand other people turned up in the evening it turned out that a mistake had
Chandipur
been made and it actually started on the 26th.



We missed this festival because on Boxing Day we were travelling to Pondicherry.



Pondicherry is a big Indian town with a beachfront promenade and a small French Quarter, a reminder that even our cross-channel cousins once had a toehold in this land.



It only took a couple of hours to walk along the promenade and inspect the French Quarter and I thought that was it. Knowing that accommodation was tight I had booked a few nights in advance, so we were going to have to stick around.



However, Pondicherry was a town that reveals its treasures piece by piece and we found that each day we liked it a little more. I can't specifically say why. Nice soup and bread in one place. Excellent coffee in another. Tasty pizza with free garlic bread and chocolate brownie somewhere else. Hmm, it's starting to add up now. Throw in some functioning wifi and we are all set up for a week.



[News item: Following the national uproar about rape and the treatment of women in society, the authorities
Gopalpur-on-sea
in Pondicherry have made it compulsory for female students to wear overcoats.]



Suddenly it was 2013.



We were back on the buses. That was ok though coz buses in Southern India are a whole different ball game to buses in Northern India.



For a start there are enough of them to cope with demand so we are not crammed in; they are not so ancient so as to be about to die at any minute; the drivers don't think they should be representing their country at a Grand Prix; and the roads are made of smooth tarmac with upward rising speed humps rather than downward dropping pot holes (sample size = 3 journeys).



We got off the bus in Trichy station after a 5 hour bus ride. The station is surrounded by hotels, one of which fitted the bill.



Despite its size, Trichy is an easy city to navigate as bus number 1 passes the main places of interest.



The first of these is the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. Claiming to be the biggest temple in India, the main entrance gate is 73
Gopalpur-on-sea
metres high and can be seen from afar. It is difficult to tell where the town ends and the temple begins as there are streets and shops inside the temple compound.



The town is centred around the Rock Fort Temple, an 83 metre high outcrop of rock thought to be one of the oldest on the planet. It has been geologically dated as older then the Himalayas. Humans have used it as both a fort and a temple, hence the name. We climbed the steps to the temple at the summit, providing views across the rooftops of the whole city.



We didn't plan to stay long in Madurai, so we took a room near to the out-of-town bus station and nipped in to visit the Sri Meenakshi temple on an autorickshaw.



This is one of India's most famous temples. It is housed in a large square compound that has a magnificent tower at each point of the compass. Each tower holds a mass of carved and gaudily painted figures of Hindu Gods and mythical characters. It is mighty impressive.



Finally we arrive at Kanyakumari, the town sitting on
Gopalpur-on-sea
the Southern tip of India. The point is billed as the confluence of 3 seas: the Arabian sea, the Indian Ocean and the Bay of Bengal. Astute readers may note that only one of these is actually a sea, that's marketing for you.



This is also said to be the only place in the world where you can witness sunset and moonrise on the same horizon.



There is a large rock (or small island) 400 metres out to sea where a revered Swami sat in meditation for 3 days in the 1870's. They built a temple on it in the 1970's which is serviced by continual ferries. Such is its popularity that the queues regularly stretch a couple of hundred metres into the thoroughfare.



On an outcrop nearby there is a 133 ft statues of Tamil Nadu's premier poet. One foot in height for every chapter of his master work.



A pink building surrounds the plinth where Mahatma Ghandi's ashes were held before being spread into the sea at this significant point. A strategically placed hole in the roof allows the sun to shine on the plinth only
Vizag beachfront
once a year, on his birthday.



There are a number of other religious buildings and a bustling tourist market selling all sorts if nik-naks to the multitude of pilgrims and tourists that descend on the town.



Several churches and Christian shrines are dotted around. St. Thomas the Apostle landed here in AD52, though the ball didn't really get rolling until the arrival of St.Francis Xavier in 1542. The church bell ringers need a lot more practice though.





We experienced the variable climate from a 4th floor room with a balcony overlooking the Cathedral sized church and the sweeping coast receding towards the wind farm and nuclear power plant. Still lots of power cuts though.

On Friday, we got to the school at 9 because we had to present our formal script to the three heads of the program: Uma, Hariharan, and our own Vinit (from NY). I felt a bit apprehensive because while other groups were finalizing theirs, we hadn't even started ours. We had talked about how we had to do it, and then we had gone to a pub, effectively eliminating any possibility of working on it. By 10, we were wondering where everyone was, all the other Indian students were working with their groups and only ours were absent. By 11, we asked everyone to call them, and apparently they were on their way. Finally two of them arrived at 11:30 and one arrived at 12. Another glorious miscommunication.

Before they arrived, Umila and I talked about our plan for the script, even though it was difficult since I don't want to exclude peoples' ideas, especially since I am co-directing with Raj Kumar. I came up with a basic flow, but when Raj and the others arrived, they had other ideas. We have such different sensibilities about things, but I have to say, it is such a difficult but rewarding process to work through this with anyone, and even more so when my partners have such different cultural backgrounds and thus, different artistic and conceptual preferences.

When the guys showed up, we got to watch the footage in the editing lab. Pradeep was nervous because he had shot it, but the rest of us couldn't wait to see it. We have about 80 minutes of B-roll. It was great! Umila took notes on every shot (216 in total) so that we could organize it into appropriate categories.

During this, as happens most days, was a power cut. Power cuts are so common that it's almost just a routine reason to take a break for a few minutes. Some power cuts are only a few moments, and others are for 6 or 8 hours. One of the students is from a region where there are only 4 hours of power a day. When we shot our b-roll, there (just our luck) was a planned power cut from 9-5. We were there from 8-5. They have a generator, but the generator created so much noise, that it interfered with our sound recording.

Presenting was surprisingly nerve-wracking, because I knew our group was not united on the main concept of the film. All of our interview questions seemed to be focused on the school, or the subject's personality. In a previous conversation with Vinit, I came to see that there had to be a much stronger focus on this woman's particular struggles, or obstacles preventing her from doing what she wants. Now in the meeting, I felt that even what we were saying was not really the story. The professors dismissed us, but I was not satisfied. Plus, I felt like I had just taken too strong a role in speaking, and it is so difficult to keep things equal while still making progress forward.

A few minutes later, outside, Vinit spoke with our group. As we were expressing more ideas about the film and more about our subject, he suggested that the real story was a woman loves children, and has no children, but creates a family-like environment from a school. Ultimately her success is that she becomes the mother she could never be. I think we had already discussed this, but we weren't able to articulate it. I didn't realize the significance of this until Vinit pointed out that in Hindu society, grandparents are seen as gods. Not having children means losing a significant status in society, and losing face. Basically, it's a big deal.

It's crazy that I didn't really get this, and that my group members got it, but I didn't know to ask them, and they didn't know to mention it to me because it is such common knowledge in their eyes.

I am reminded again and again that this process cannot be completed in some quick, direct way. It is a rigorous churning of incomplete ideas, bruised egos, tentative suggestions, sensitive insistence, reluctant compromise, and eventual acceptance. It is exhausting and deeply satisfying. And did I mention exhausting. Basically, I love it.

Evidence that potty humor is universal: Some of my fourth grade boys were sweeping the steps of the school (all the students participate in basic chores). As I walked past on my way back to the guesthouse where all of the volunteers stay, they surrounded me whispering that I should tell one of the other boys a word in Tamil. They assured me that it was a sign of respect. Positive that they were up to something I told <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">them the word rather than directing the potentially offensive phrase at the innocent bystander. They immediately broke out laughing. Finally, they told me, the word did not in fact indicate respect, but meant… fart. I could hear their continued giggles the entire way from the steps to the door of the guesthouse.

I am back to my room for a bit before my last class of my first week (although not a whole week). The schedule here is rigorous, but I glad I started teaching right away. I think having a regular schedule, goals and tasks, and regular interactions with the other teachers and my students has helped me feel more at home than I expected to feel in the first week.

The day starts at 6:30. The older students have prep time in which they finish homework and study. The younger students have PT, when they play soccer, basketball, and other games. Today was my first time leading PT. It was a lovely way to wake up. The sunrises here are beautiful. A haze, clinging to the thick trees, settles over the lower land around the school. As the sun rises, color seeps into the gray sky. The air is cool and smells fresh and earthy.

At 7:30, breakfast is served. It usually has consisted of a grain like rice or (today) ground wheat, a curry sauce, and an egg. The fried eggs are especially tasty. Slightly sweet, which is a nice match for the curry. Nothing has been terribly spicy, in fact not as spicy as some of the Indian food I’ve had in the States, but it is certainly spicier than what I usually have for breakfast. There is also tea or coffee, both with lots of milk and <em style=""mso-bidi-font-style: normal;"">lots of sugar. It is like dessert. Like if you melted ice cream and heated it up. I miss my strong coffee with a pinch of sugar, but the sweetness of the drinks is nice since there isn’t dessert.

After breakfast, there are three class periods, followed by a morning tea. The children drink tea and sweet lentil porridge. Morning tea is followed by a daily assembly. The school recites a beautiful, non-sectarian prayer, and, on Fridays, sings the Indian national anthem. Then some of the older students present news stories from around the world. After hearing the stories, the other children are encouraged to ask questions. On morning, when students had few questions, Dr. George, the founder and head of the school scolded them telling them the importance of forming opinions and of thinking critically about what they read and hear. Although he is much sterner with the children than I am, it is clear how much he loves them. He has earned their respect not from fear, but from love and high expectations. After the news, Dr. George speaks. He speaks to them candidly about problems at the school and around the world. All of the students, even the young ones, know about the recent rape in Delhi. The last several days, assembly has been a time at which students could ask questions and process the horrible event. In a meeting, Dr. George told me that it must seem shocking to me, but he believes the children must know about the entirety of the world if they are to live in it. To protect them, we must inform them. I appreciate his devotion to the students and his belief in their ability to understand more than many.

After assembly, the students return to two periods of class before lunch. Both lunches and dinners have been delicious. Almost always, there is rice and curry again, but also tasty side dishes like carrots with finely shredded coconut, fennel, ginger, and red pepper. Also, beat and onion salad, a green bean coconut dish, and a flat bread somewhere between the naan I’ve had in the States and tortillas. After lunch, there are three periods before afternoon snack. In the afternoon, the older students have PT, while the younger students complete their homework and do chores. From 5 to 6, the students bath and relax. Before and after dinner, the older students study and the oldest have more classes. After dinner, the young ones get ready for bed and a volunteer reads them a bedtime story. The older students study until the power goes out around 9 or 10.

When I write it all out, it makes me feel a bit better about being so tired at the end of the day. We have a long weekend as the region is celebrating a harvest festival (in January!!!). I hope that by the beginning of next week I will be better rested and have a better sense of the direction I want to move with my classes.

My 12th graders are preparing for a huge standardized test. Imagine the SATs, except it is more important as that is the only academic component of a college application, and it is more knowledge based. When I arrived, the Vice Principal told me that the 12th grade was struggling with writing. While they might know the information, they weren’t able to communicate it in an organized and effective way. Over the last several days we have practiced how to construct a topic sentence, present evidence, and explain analysis. It was frustrating at first and I felt out of my dept. I have never taken a class about how to teach writing. I have not even taken a writing class, as I tested out of my freshman level writing course. Moreover, because of the test for which they are preparing is so important and so different from American tests, I am worried that I will teach them to write an answer that will not get them the best grade. But as I have gotten over jet leg and as I have gotten to know the students and test better, I feel more capable of the task. It has been good to have a goal and a challenge. I feel excited for class, excited to find ways to help them understand. It is such a great feeling when one of my students repeats a metaphor I used the day before. I am proud (and amazed) that I thought of something they can remembered.

My 11th grade class is not quite as focused, as they do not have a text bearing down. It has taken me longer to find structure for my lessons. A low point of my week was when a student fell asleep. I know from my years of being a sleepy student that this is not necessarily my fault, but I still felt embarrassed and inadequate. Hopefully within the next couple of weeks I will find a way to connect with them and wake them up.

My theatre classes are fun and crazy as expected. There are many students and the room is small. But what could be better than pretending to be a gorilla with a bunch of laughing children, even if it is difficult to quiet them down for instructions. I only wish I had the classes more regularly. I don’t feel like I know them yet, but I suppose that will come in time.

It is night now—a while since I started this entry—and I am back in the school building, so I can post this on the internet. No internet in the guesthouse. I look forward to walking back after closing down my computer. The air will be cool and soft. Insects will buzz, but bite surprisingly little (only three bites so far!). And I will look at the stars. Have I mentioned the stars? They are breath taking. Although not as many as in Montana, they are still bright and clear away from lights of any city or town. The big dipper sits differently in the sky, but is still the big dipper. It makes me happy to think that in less than 12 hours everyone back home will be looking up at the same stars. I look on the giant wall map, which hangs in the main room of the school building, and I can’t believe the distance I have covered. But when I talk to the children, who are so much like the children at home, and when I look at the stars, home feels so close I could blow a kiss and you catch it.




Thankful for…

Today we had the opportunity to shoot b-roll at the monessori school. Umila and I met the rest of the crew at the street where they had rented a van and picked up all the equipment at the academy. It took us 20 minutes, since it was about 5 kilometers away. On the street, just like yesterday, we passed auto rickshaws crowded with people, oxen, pedestrians, bicyclists, and everybody was simultaneously trying to occupy the same space. Entire families on a moped. Five people in a rickshaw. I'm surprised there aren't more accidents. But since no one is going too fast, it kind of works out. It's like how water appears to be one thing, you don't see it as separate molecules, but as a liquid whole, the same goes for the traffic here. It turns molecular people into liquid traffic. As crazy as it kind of is, all the constant noise and jostling is oddly calming. You might almost feel, as you are thrown this way and that, that there is no way that you are in control of your own safety, let alone your entire life, so you may as well just relax and enjoy the ride.

It was a long, but fruitful day. Taking 3 people to go see the location is totally different from taking 7, plus camera and sound. It was never easy to crowd all 7 of us behind the camera while somehow remaining unobtrusive to the classroom, and forget about it when the academic coordinator arrived. He was quick to explain that he has been in the tv industry, doing news, for years. every time I passed him, he'd stop me to give a lecture on how to shoot as little as possible, cut them off if they aren't saying what you want, only take the shots you need, hurry up, don't waste time or film, shoot from here, do this, do that, ask them the question that will give you the exact answer you want. i respected him, but i just have a different philosophy about how to get the subject to open up. i found it difficult to work with him looming around like a hyperactive vulture.

we got so much b-roll. it was so hot. we had to shut off the fans whenever we filmed because the sound of the fans was distracting, so we just pretty much sweated our balls off from 8am to 5pm when we finished. i kept being surprised that it was ok for adults like us, who were pretty much strangers, to just walk into a school and play with the kids, even picking up and swinging around the toddlers. how is this ok? how is no one suing me?

when we got to the older kids, we shot b-roll in one class, and when we went to shoot in the next class, the students from the first class (about 8 of them) all scrambled to pick up their desks and chairs and drag them into the next class so that they could be filmed again. i suppose some elements of this documentary are going to be staged. Raj asked a girl who was drawing, to draw a building and name it with the name of the school. He directed a bunch of students to run into the entrance holding hands with our interviewee. I think it's just fine, but my tendancy is always to just shoot what is there. I don't know if that makes me a purist or if it makes me a wuss.

Tomorrow we will review our footage and prepare for our interview on saturday. tonight I'm meeting everyone for dinner. Then much needed sleep!

It is about six in the morning. I wanted to finish some lesson plans and write this before the day began. I have been quite busy and already feel about bit behind. I expected the school building to be empty for the next half hour (the students start their day at 6:30), but some of the older students are already studying.

I am sitting in the dark to conserve electricity, which is limited. The school is largely powered by solar power; but as that does not fully support all the needs, they are still reliant on the electrical infrastructure, which is extremely expensive and unreliable. I am happy that I have found it so easy to adjust to brushing my teeth, finding clothes, and grading papers by flashlight. The easy with which I can live without constantly flipping the light switch makes me guilty for the amount of energy I use in the States. However, if I weren’t at the school and were living on my own I think I would find lack of electricity much harder. Because the electricity is constantly turning off, it isn’t possible to keep perishable food in the volunteer’s refrigerator.

Last night I was finally hit by jet lag. I think that for the last two days I have been so busy and excited to be here that I didn’t feel tired. I was fighting to stay awake in our volunteer meeting last night, which was embarrassing and frustrating. I so grateful for them—they are a time for volunteers to talk about problems, brainstorm, etc—but I didn’t feel like my brain was up to the conversation. After a night of sleep, I feel better.

The nights gets quite cool. I sleep with just a sheet, but at times think I’d be comfortable with a light blanket. Through my window pours India music (I think the security guards play it after the rest of campus has gone to bed). I hear birds singing and the thwack of palms slapping together in the wind. If it weren’t for these sounds, I might forget I am in India as I drift in that place between wake and sleep. I had prepared myself for everything to be different. Here at the school I have been struck by what we share—a beautiful thought to be struck by. But, I think that I if I get a chance to travel into the nearby villages I will be hit over the head with the differences.

This contrast between the familiar and the new is indicative of India, I think. The place is a contradiction in so many ways. When I arrived at the airport, I was surprised by who western it felt. It looked much like the Paris airport I’d just left. It was not even hot enough to make me fully understand that I had come so far. But as we drove (on the left side of the road). Indian music played over the radio. My driver had a miniature figuring of “Monkey God,” he told me, on his dashboard. We made our way out of Bangalore, onto a winding, two-way highway that passed through towns and villages of varying size. We passed big houses with gates in front, tiny mud huts, stray dogs, shops with brightly painted gates pulled down in front for the night. And lots of shrines. Every village had multiple shrines, some beautiful and elaborate, some small and plan. But all lit. Bright lights, in a place where electricity is so unreliable, shined on the deities. The car ride was stunning and immersive; the two hours zipped by as I tried to take note of everything I saw, all that was familiar and new.

When I arrived at the school, it was pretty much, “Here’s your room. See you in the morning.” At first this surprised me. I felt a bit at sea, fumbling around in my dark room, trying not to wake my roommate. But as there was not electricity at the time and as it was three in the morning, any other conversation or introductions would have been silly.

My room and roommate are both lovely. The room is comfortable and clean. The roommate, a Russian woman about my age named Masha, is warm, fun-loving, and thoughtful. I feel lucky to be in such a nice room with such an nice person.

Oh, my… I just realize that my battery is about to die. I can’t plug it in during the school day as it drains the solar power. So I will have to sign off with many typos presumably as I have not even read over what I am about to post. There is so much more I want to write. So much more that has happened in just two days. I guess I will have to wait until tonight.

P.S. I have yet to see a mosquito.

I am thankful for…

Reiseroute Südindien
Chennai - Mahabalipuram - Puducherry - Kumbakonam - Madurai - Periyar - Kerala Backwaters - Kochi - Trivandrum-Kovalam


Kirche St.Thomas in Chennai
Pilger vor der Krippe
27. Dez. 2012 - Ankunft in Chennai nach langem Nachtflug (Wien - Dubai - Chennai). Immigration in Indien ziemlich langwierig. Wir steigen in den wartenden Bus und fahren durch Chennai (ehemaliges Madras). Indien empfängt uns mit der vollen Wucht seiner Geschäftigkeit und Menschnmassen. Die Straßen sind viel zu eng und ständig verstopft. Alles Leben spielt sich neben der Fahrbahn ab. Menschen in bunten Gewändern gehen ihren Geschäften nach, hektische Motorradfahrer führen viel zu viele Passagiere vom Kleinkind bis zu Frauen im Sari auf dem Sozius. Busse und LKWs fahren aufeinander zu, um im letzten Augenblick doch auf die richtige Seite auszuweichen. Wir besichtigen die katholische Kirche St. Thomas, die Grabkirche des Hl. (ungläubigen) Thomas, der hier ab 52 n. Chr. missioniert hat. (Hier im Süden Indiens gibt es viele Christen, aber auch Muslime, die mit den zahlreichen Hindus harmonisch zusammenleben). Unser Hotel liegt am Strand von Mahabalipuram.

28. Dez. 2012 wir fahren in die alte Pilgerstadt Kanchipuram (eine der 7 heiligen Städte Indiens), wo wir den berühmten Vishnu-Tempel (Kamashi-T.) besuchen. Wir sind mitten unter Massen von Pilgern (Frauen in bunten Saris ebenso wie tradtionell gekleidete Männer oder Bettelmönche - die Sadhus), die in fröhlichen Prozessionen Vishnu und den vielen Nebengöttern
Kanchipuram
Gläubige im Shivatempel
ihre Ehrerbietung erweisen. Am Nachmittag zurück in Mahabalipuram besichtigen wir berühmte Monumente der indischen Steinhauerkunst von riesigen Ausmaßen. Die fünf Rathas (UNESCO Welterbe - aus gewachsenem Granit gehauene riesige Schreine in Form von Prozessionswagen), und das riesige Steinrelief (27 x 9 m) und der Shoretempel werden von so vielen indischen Besuchern heimgesucht, dass man sich wie auf einem Jahrmarkt vorkommt.

29. Dez. 2012 - Wir fahren mit unserem Bus nach Süden, nach Pondycherry. Die ehemalige franz. Kolonie genießt als Unionsterritorium Sonderstatus. Die Altstadt ist von französischen Kolonialbauten geprägt und an der Strandpromenade im Stil der Cote d´Azur versuchen einige Lokale französisches Flair zu verbreiten. Ein großer Teil der kolonialen Stadt ist im Besitz der Ashra-Sekte (""Hari-Krishna""), deren Gründer Sri Aurobindo hier ein Mausoleum besitzt. Kolonialzeitliche katholische Kirchen sind ebenso wie die Moscheen im muslimischen Viertel von regem Leben erfüllt. Die indischen Stadtviertel sind genauso hektisch wie überall, besonders eindrucksvoll der lebendige Shiva-Kult im hinduistischen Tempel.

30. Dez. 2012 - Die heutige Fahrt ist 140 km lang. 4 Stunden reine Fahrzeit durch dicht besiedeltes Land. Intensiv genutzte Reisfelder wechseln sich mit hektischen Dörfern und Städten ab. Obwohl Sonntag ist, ist der Verkehr mörderisch. Die Fahrweise der Inder ebenso. Jetzt
Shiva Priester
Im Shivatempel Sri-Ekambaranathar
bin ich sicher, dass 2 Tempelbesuche pro Tag das Minimum sind um zu überleben. Wir besuchen einen ärmlichen Sonntagsmarkt, beobachten die Seilherstellung aus Kokosfasern und sind zu Gast in einem Dorftempel, wo Gläbige den Segen Shivas für ihre neuen Autos erbitten. Äußerst eindrucksvoll ist der berühmte Shivatempel in Chidambaram aus dem 9. Jh., wo ein endloser Pilgerstrom zu den Opferhandlungen der Brahmanen (Priester) strömt. Die tiefe Gläubigkeit der Menschen im mysthischen Allerheiligsten beeindruckt sehr. Im Licht der Abendsonne kommen wir in Kumbakonam (ehem. Tanjore) an. Hier tauchen bis 1000 Jahre alte Tempel wie Pilze auf. Einer ist wegen seiner besonderen Architektur und Steinreliefkunst als UNESCO Weltkulturerbe gelistet (Irawardeswarar Tempel).

31. Dez. 2012 - Die Reise führt von Kumbakonam nach Madurai. In Thanjavur besuchen wir den um 1000 n.Chr. errichteten Brihadiasvara-Tempel, der von seinen Dimensionen her beeindruckt. Die Chola-Könige der damaligen Zeit verlangten ihren Untertanen Unmengen an Tribut für Errichtung und Betrieb der Tempel ab. Man wird vom Tempelelefanten begrüßt und taucht in das religiöse Treiben, einer Mischung aus Jahrmarkt und religiösem Fanatismus ein. Wir fahren den ganzen Tag durch eine dicht besiedelte Landschaft, wo sich Reisfelder und ärmliche Dörfer abwechseln. Außer Strom fehlt diesen jegliche Infrastruktur. Die mit Palmblättern
Sadhu

gedeckten Lehmhütten haben Plumpsklo und gleich daneben den Brunnen. Neben der Landwirtschaft versuchen die Menschen mit allem möglichen Handel zu überleben. Welch andere Welt in unserem Hotel in Madurai, wo die indische Oberschicht Neujahr zelebriert und das Galadinner als Heiratsmarkt nützt.

1.Jän. 2013 - Die 1,4 Millionenstadt Madurai ist zu Neujahr so hektisch, als ob kein Feiertag wäre. Der Trumalai-Nayak Palast erinnert in seiner architektonischen Linie an die Alhambra in Cordoba, eine Stilrichtung, die hier in Südindien kaum vorkommt. Allerdings ist von dem im 17. Jh. errichteten Palast nur mehr ein Viertel erhalten, das allerdings von seiner Größe und Schönheit beindruckend ist. Wenn man den Zustand sieht, fragt man sich wie bei vielen nichtklerikalen Bauten allerdings: wie lange noch? Gut erhalten hingegen ist der Sri-Meenakshi Tempel, der im 20. Jh. renoviert wurde und dessen 12 riesigen Tempeltürme in bunter Farbenpracht erstrahlen. Der Pilgerstrom von 10.000 Gläubigen pro Tag reißt bis in den späten Abend nicht ab, denn die riesige Tempelanlage zählt zu den heiligsten Stätten in Südindien. Die zahlreichen Götterstatuen werden mit inbrünstigem Fanatismus verehrt, der bei der Abendzeremonie, wenn der Meenakshi Schrein geschlossen wird, seinen Höhepunkt erreicht.

2. Jän. 2013 - Auf der 140 km langen Strecke
Die fünf Rathas
Die aus Granitmonolithen herausgemeiselten Monumente, die die Streitwagen der hinduistischen Götter darstellen, sind UNESCO Welterbe.
von Madurai nach Osten in den Bundesstaat Kerala steigt die Landschaft stetig an. Dadurch ändert sich das Klima. Von der heißen Küstenebene, wo fast nur Reis und Zuckerrohr gedeihen, kommt man zunehmend in einen Gemüsegarten. Plantagen tropischer Früchte lockern das Bild auf. Es gibt Papayas, Kokosplamen, Guaven, Bananen, aber auch Wein. Kahle Weinstöcke, die gerade ihr Laub abgeworfen haben stehen neben gerade ausgetriebenen, aber auch neben erntereifen. Die Landwirtschaft wird großteils mit primitivsten Mitteln wie vor 1000en Jahren betrieben. An den Flüssen sieht man Frauen beim Wäschewaschen. Steil geht es dann in die Kardamom – Berge, auf deren Hängen die verschiedensten Arten von Gewürzen gedeihen. Die Straße windet sich mit Spitzkehren bis über 800m Seehöhe, wo der Schlagbaum an der Grenze nach Kerala passiert wird. Der Ort Kumily hat hervorragende Infrastruktur für den Fremdenverkehr, sodass man sich aus Tamil Nadu kommend wie in einer anderen Welt vorkommt. Hier oben befindet sich um einen Stausee das große Periyar - Naturschutzgebiet, das mit echtem Dschungel, dem laubwerfenden tropischen Monsunwald bedeckt ist. Im Park leben u.a. ca. 1000 Elefanten (von denen wir auch ein Rudel zu Gesicht bekommen), aber auch ca. 50 Tiger, sowie zahlreiche Vogelarten. Am Abend und in der Nacht wird

es durch die Höhe bedingt ziemlich kühl, tagsüber ist es angenehm warm, aber nicht heiß.

3. Jän. 2013 – Der Morgen auf 800m Seehöhe beginnt angenehm kühl. Wir besuchen hier eine biologische Gewürzplantage, wo Kardamom, Zimt, schwarzer Pfeffer, Vanille, Muskat, Gewürznelken, ""All Spices"" so wie einst im Dschungel in bunter Vielfalt nebeneinander gedeihen. Wir sind in jenem Land, das am Ende des Mittelalters die europäischen Entdecker auf die Meere trieb um das Land zu finden, wo der begehrte Pfeffer wächst. Die Kardamomberge fallen nach Westen steil ab. Die Hänge sind in ca. 500m Seehöhe wie mit einem Polsterteppich mit den Sträuchern der Teeplantagen bedeckt. Weiter unten finden sich Kaffee- und Kautschukplantagen. Wir kommen beim wöchentlichen Viehmarkt vorbei, wo wie einst im Wilden Westen die Bauern ihre Rinder verkaufen. Nur werden diese nicht in die Bahn verladen, sondern mit unvorstellbarer Brutalität auf Lastwagen gepfercht und abtransportiert. Im Tiefland beginnt wieder dichtere Besiedlung. Die Städte sind hier wesentliche gepflegter als in Tamil Nadu, wir fahren sogar durch ausgedehnte Villenviertel, wo der Wohlstand der Bewohner von Kerala, verglichen mit dem übrigen Indien zum Ausdruck kommt. Schließlich erreichen wir in Kottayam die „Backwaters“ eine weite Lagunenlandschaft hinter der Küste Keralas. Hier schiffen wir
Mahabalipuram Beach
Der indische Ozean lädt nicht wirklich zum Baden ein
uns für die nächsten 2 Tage in die Hausboote ein. Es sind dies von der Bauart Frachtkähne, die mit Bambus und Binsengeflecht zu komfortablen Wohnbooten gestaltet wurden.

4. Jän. 2013 – Ruhig gleiten unsere drei Hausboote durch die Kanäle der Backwaters des Vambanad Sees. Die Fahrt beginnt im Vogelschutzgebiet Kumarakom. Landeinwärts folgt auf die Lagune eine Landschaft mit Reisfeldern, die unter dem Wasserniveau der Lagune liegen. Sie sind durch Deiche geschützt. Die Bewässerungskanäle verlaufen höher als die Reisfelder, die Dörfer stehen auf aufgeschütteten Inseln und auf den Deichen. Die Bewohner sind freundlich, man wird gleich eingeladen, in die schönen, blitzsauberen Häuser zu kommen. Aus Kerala sind besonders viele Arbeitskräfte im Ausland – am Golf, in Europa, Amerika - und investieren ihr Geld in Häuser in der alten Heimat. Alles Leben spielt sich am Wasser ab. In den Kanälen und Wasserstraßen wird gefischt, gebadet, Wäsche gewaschen, Geschirr abgewaschen… Von der Hektik der indischen Städte ist nichts zu spüren. Auf den Hausbooten herrscht ebenso diese Ruhe und wir genießen die Eindrücke von Natur und Dorfleben im Vorbeigleiten, während die Crew für uns sorgt.

5. Jänner – Die Hausboote legen in Alleppy an, wo der Bus schon wartet, der uns nach

Kochi bringt. Das ehemalige Cochin ist die älteste europäische Siedlung in Indien. Ihr Reichtum begründete sich auf dem Gewürzhandel, der die gesamte Ostküste Südindiens, die Malabarküste, umfasste. Die Portugiesen gründeten Fort Cochin bereits 1503 und nützten dabei die Rivalität der lokalen Fürsten, indem sie den Raja von Cochin gewannen, den Gewürzhandel statt mit den Arabern mit den Europäern zu betreiben. Wir besuchen hier die älteste Kirche Indiens, die 1502 errichtete St. Francis Church, wo sich die ursprüngliche Grabstätte Vasco da Gamas befindet, dem Entdecker des Seeweges nach Indien, der hier 1524 als Vizekönig Indiens verstarb. In Fort Cochin sehen wir auch den Mattancherry-Palast, ein Geschenk der Portugiesen an den Raja von Cochin. Viel Atmosphäre strahlt das Judenviertel mit seiner Synagoge aus, obwohl hier kaum mehr Juden, sondern Inder als Händler tätig sind. Am Hafen erzählen die riesigen chinesischen Fischernetze von einer Zeit, als die Fischer hier riesige Ausbeute machten. Im übrigen ist Kochi so hektisch wie alle indischen Städte. Wir verbringen den letzten Abend mit unserer Gruppe im gemütlichen Dachgarten eines Hotels im Geschäftsviertel, wo sich auch die indische Upperclass trifft.

Flughafen. Außer der starken indischen Miltärpräsenz mutet alles westlich an. Wir verabschieden uns von unserer Gruppe, die nach Wien zurückreist. Ingrid und ich fliegen mit Freunden weiter nach Trivandrum. Von dort fahren wir nach Kovalam. Der ehemalige Traumstrand der Hippies hat sich zu einem Fremdenverkehrsort entwickelt, mit einer für indische Verhältnisse unglaublichen Infrastruktur an Hotels, Restaurants und Geschäften. Wir schlagen unser Quartier am Palmshore Beach auf und tauchen in die indische Strandatmosphäre ein, umgeben von Yoga und Ayurveda. Die Zeit ist jedoch zu kurz, um mehr als einen Eindruck davon mitzunehmen.

7.-12. Jän. 2012 - Wir sind in Kovalam am Strand. Wir befinden uns am 8. Breitengrad, also innerhalb der feuchten Tropen. Obwohl es schwül ist, ist das Klima gut verträglich, denn wir haben Trockenzeit: 30 Grad bei Tag, 26 bei Nacht, das Meer hat 29 Grad; wenn keine Wellen sind, kann man am schönen Sandstrand wunderbar baden. Der Ort war der Traumstrand der Hippies in den 70er Jahren. Mittlerweile ist alles verbaut, die Beach aber nach wie vor super. Wir sind Gott sei Dank ein wenig abseits in einem Hotel mit privatem Strandabschnitt, wo man von alldem nichts merkt. Unser Hotel ist ausgebucht und man trifft auf eine

illustre Gesellschaft: von den Ex-68ern über italienische Reisegruppen bis zu jungen Pärchen findet man hier alles. Ein bisschen ist es wie Griechenland in den 80er Jahren, alles sehr urig und basic. Die Menschen sind freundlich und bemühen sich, aber es mangelt an jeder Ecke an Know How. Interessanterweise sind hier Europäer aller Herren Länder, aber kaum Inder. Für die Upper Class, die sich Urlaub leisten kann, scheint das urige Strandleben zu minder und die anderen haben sowieso mit dem Überleben zu kämpfen. Als Inder der Upper Class spricht man untereinander Englisch, schätzt gutes westliches Benehmen und steigt nicht unter 4*+ ab.

Enjoying the German Party
Clockwise from back: Nickhil, Catherine, Kishori, and Vinceya.
I have always been terrible at saying goodbye. I envy the people who know just what to say, and just when people will neither be too happy nor too sad to see you go. My special breed of social anxiety has always led me to err on the side of caution and bow out too early (don't want to overstay my welcome) and wordlessly (don't want to bother everyone or steal attention).

But there is no hiding this time. It helps in some ways to have a set time of departure, so everyone can be prepared for it. On the other hand, though, I often get this sense from the students that I am abandoning them. I feel that some are already beginning the process of pushing me away. (They've been through this many times before, after all.) In light of that, the week has been filled with one goodbye after another, with events and moments that I wish I could either keep or change. I keep thinking, ""I don't want my last interaction with this child to be me disciplining them,"" or, ""Why can't I hold onto this moment a little longer? It's so perfect...""

I think it
My German Party Outfit
really started for me with the German Party. We had to prepare four songs for this Christmas Party thrown by a group of German companies in Bangalore--SB sends its choir every year as a thank you to these companies, which are some of its biggest funders. There were a lot of stressful factors, and a lot of instances where students didn't come when asked, and so preparations got tense. But then there were also these beautiful moments, like when Prathibha (who wasn't even going) asked me, ""Miss Lynn, why aren't you wearing a fancy dress?"" When I replied, ""This is all I have,"" she arranged with Vinceya for me to go to the girls' dorm and try on some of their outfits. I ended up in this traditional sparkly pink outfit, and all in all it fit pretty well, if it was a bit long.

And then there was the stress of preparations for Sports Day and Christmas (celebrated on December 12 and 13 at SB, respectively). My students, being the eldest, were given many many many responsibilities for these events, so trying to have class with them this past week has been a little bit like herding cats.
Part of the German Party Crew
Clockwise from me: Nickhil, Ruby Joy, SP, Kishori, Shrimathi, Shree, Vinceya, Prem.
And to top it all off, I decided to have a project presentation day on the last day of classes, and (as is only natural) most of them did not do their project work in advance, so they had to scramble around these other events.

For any of you who did Track and Field Day in elementary school, that is basically what Sports Day boils down to, except you should probably add a cupful of Olympics to the recipe. The students are separated into four teams (yellow, red, purple, and green), and spend days practicing their marching and preparing for soccer, basketball, and long-jump competitions. At the beginning of the ceremony proper, there's a marching event, as well as a lighting of a torch and raising of the four flags. There was a small platform where all of the volunteers and Miss Beena sat to watch the events. From that vantage, we had a perfect view of the track where the youngest did relays. I think my favorite relay was one where the preschoolers had to run to a plate, eat a biscuit, and run to the finish line. There was one particular preschooler who didn't quite grasp the
Santa Came to SB!
idea of a relay and laconically nibbled on her biscuit long after the rest of the students had finished. My second favorite was the twelfth graders jumping up to try to catch rolls strung on a rope above them (they could only catch it with their teeth, creating this hilarious fish-like effect). But eventually we the teachers were roused from our seats to compete as well. I was part of the yellow team, and the teacher/staff competitions included two games. In the first, we were each given an animal name and released to find our partner of the same name, but only using animal noises and actions. I ended up being quite the forlorn cow, because my partner gave up early and so I was left alone in the middle of the field mooing. The kids enjoyed it, in any case. The second event was shaving balloons, and the yellow team immediately selected Peter to represent us (as a male, he has far more experience, right?), but we came in last anyway. All in all, it was a fun day, though. The red team ended up winning both the marching and overall titles.

Personally, though, Christmas was a struggle
Christmas Party
because the main event was a concert. I decided early on in the week that the choir would be fine singing through a couple of carols without much rehearsal (...more on that in a moment), so I focussed in on my individual and group voice lessons. There were many last-minute rehearsals, many concessions made from all parties, but also many smiles during this crunch time. One group in particular, a quartet of ninth-grade girls, was a pleasure to work with because they loved their song so much. I can't blame them, as it was ""At the Beginning"" from Anastasia, and I have very fond memories of that song from my childhood. I was also very excited to see how Cathy did, as she was singing a solo: ""Listen"" from Dreamgirls. She has this naturally rich-'n-husky voice, and we worked really hard to release it. I remember one particular rehearsal this week when I had tried telling her in various ways that she needed to relax her throat and sing from her diaphragm, and nothing seemed to help. Then, suddenly, we did an exercise and she looked at me with these wonderfully bewildered eyes and said, ""That time I could feel
Gangam Style!
it, right here,"" and she pointed to her stomach. ""Is that right?""

Except for lighting issues (which are almost a given at SB--our limited electricity leads to a lot of back-up plans), the concert went over quite well. I was so proud of my individual students, and even though the full choir hadn't had much time to practice their carols with me (I was more focussed on German Party the week previous), they did well. Then, at the end, four preschoolers came onstage with packages labled, ""Mr. Peter,"" ""Miss Ally,"" ""Mr. Sachin,"" and ""Miss Lynn."" She had been alluding to a surprise for the past week, but I had no clue what to expect. So we each went to our respective child and opened our packages. At first, I had no idea what was going on, as it was a CD case taped to a box. Then, upon closer inspection, I discovered that it said, ""A Shanti Bhavan Christmas"" on the cover, and Lizzy started playing a recording of children singing Christmas carols. Apparently, for the last two weeks, the choir had been secretly recording themselves singing carols (no wonder they did so well)! The box contained a frame
My Thank You Card
with a picture of two of the preschoolers. I hope the kids could see my melted heart seeping onto the floor.

After the concert, we had a fine dinner of fries and mac and cheese, which is quite the treat! But before we could eat, the eleventh graders had planned a dance-off, and my name was drawn with Tom, Lizzy's father who was visiting. We actually ended up winning third place, and I think we shocked quite a few folks with our dance...commitment. Our prize was a Fozzy the Bear book, so we donated it to the school.

With those events finished, these last couple of days have been a bit heartwrenching. Last night, I stayed up ""late"" with the eleventh and twelfth graders in the school building. Gayathri was doing some special mehndi for me, which took many hours but turned out beautifully, and Lizzy was playing mafia with the others. It was good to finally spend some time outside of class and choir with them. I wish that had been a possibility earlier. Another SB tradition (aside from last-night mehndi) for those departing is to sign students' autograph books. I managed to do this last week for the eleventh and twelfth graders, but it is likely that more will trickle to me during my last hours here. I have also left a poem for my two English classes, based off of ""A Prayer for My Daughter"" by Yeats (one of the pieces they have studied). I am hoping they won't find it until after I've left, because I don't really want to talk about the sentiments I expressed in it. On the flip side, I gave my students a ""Happy Book"" to sign for me. Some readers here may be familiar with the concept, but for those of you who aren't: A Happy Book is a notebook where each person gets a page upon which they write or draw a list of things that make them happy. It's a wonderful way to remember others, and it can brighten a sad day simply by reading a page or two.

This morning at assembly, the four of us who are leaving (Ally, Peter, Lizzy, and I) were all given fine speeches and cards. Cathy spoke about me, and although the other teachers had three or more students speaking about them, I felt like the most honored teacher in the world. She talked about how I encouraged her to sing from her heart and not be afraid of mistakes in voice lessons, and how I encouraged the English classes to speak their minds (and, more humorously, how I always kept the students on track, even when they tried to distract me). The personal way in which she spoke let me know that I have made an impact, even if it was just a small one upon her.

I feel so blessed. These students mean the world to me, and although I'm heading home, I have every intention of circling the globe again. They're family, after all.

Maddest Bus Driver in India :)
So after we finished our volunteering in the South it was time to get back on the road and head for the mountains. The first stop was Madurai for one night, we got up at 5 a.m to experience the temple there, which was a little haunting with the chants at that time in the morning but a great experience.

After Madurai we went to Kumily/Thekkady, which is a great place for treks and a wonder round a tiger reservation which we did in the afternoon. From Kumily we took the maddest bus journey I have ever exprienced to Munnar! we got onto the bus at 6 a.m with banging Indian music being played and flashing lights! it was a 6 hour bus journey through mountains, tea plantations and TIGHT corners as we wound our way up through the mountains, we still had white knuckles by the time we got to our hoemstay!

We took a moped and rode 60km up and down through the mountains of Munnar for the day to a hill station up in the clouds. The ride was brilliant and refreshing! we spent time walking round the tea plantations and stopping off at view points
""Want a lift my mate?""
to take in the open mountain views.

We have been in Ooty for 5 days now, been out on a moped for the day and now just chilling and taking a break from the travelling (I know it must be such hard work!!! ;p ) we have spent a total of about 30 hours on buses in the last week or so up through the mountains at a cost of next to nothing and it has been the best way to see what the other side of India has to offer . . . Next we will be in Hampi, see ya then 😊

Traditional Henna
We have spent time in the rural villages of Tamil Nadu and seen how they use their homes as factorys for weaving, making pots from clay and also teaching.

We visited a village where the trade is weaving. We were invinted into these peoples homes to see how it was done. It was amazing to see how the machinery to weave was built within theri homes and the engineering that goes into making a saree from scratch. We also visited homes that produced clay pots from locally sorced clay. Although payment is not massive it is a long tradition of work that is kept within the families of the villages.

On one visit to a village we met with a women who was head of the village. She showed how to make traditional henna from leaves ground on stone by stone with water. The mashed up leaves are then placed on different parts of the body and left for about 15 minutes before washing off. The henna lasts for about 15 days! check the pics out 😊

Gimme Five!! with the kids from salt pan area
Since working with the children we have also been out to see what life is like for the salt pan workers and how womens groups forged through the help of SCAD help their communties grow.

Salt pan workers work near the coast on salt farms. The work is hard and the days are long. Salt water needs the right climate to dry out leaving the salt behind it takes about 30 days for the whole process to end and if there is rain it can all be destroyed in no time. The salt pan workers have to skim the salt from the fields and load it into piles and them bag it ready for shipping. They work 7 days a week from 6-1 in the afternoon and then after they have had dinner for hours in the evening. Women get 150 rupees (about 2 quid) and the men 180 rupees (just over 2 quid) per day!!!! SCAD has helped the salt pan workers to devise ways to combat debpt they have worked up with the owners of the salt plains through womens groups saving 5 rupees a month for a year and building it up until they loan each other
Salt Pan Worker
money without having to pay the owners whose interest rate is about 30%!! SCAD has also develpoed schools here for children to gain education and not have to work on the plains, children as young as 7 were working on the plains before this!

We also saw the great work that womens groups do in the villages. They have a house they all meet in and discuss whats going on. They decide if a child can take a loan from them to go to higher education. They also help people grow kitchen gardens to grow their own food and make business by weaving . . .

At the school with the kids
So we have been at the volunteering project now for 2 weeks. So far we have worked with the kids at the school for children who are mentally challenged as well as with the children from the gypsy camps. It's really good to see how eagar they are to learn and how confident they are around us and when performing. We were 'guests' to one of their school celebrations where they performed dance, singing and playing instruments as well as reciting something in Tamil, which we couldnt understand but they did with great ease and confidence. The great thing about what SCAD do is to give the womens groups in the villages money to loan to kids who want to go to higher education, for disabled kids this is free but for abled children they loan the money and pay back with little interest and the money goes straight back to the womens group to be used again for another kid who wants higher education, this is to give the children the feeling that they ARE paying for their education and not just getting it through hand outs. It's hard not to say that if some children from our country saw
Jess with the kids
how hard these people have to work for education it would perhaps make them realise how lucky they are! but thats another disscusion for the pub! 😊

1: The Third Head Gesture 15 secs


I have to admit, I have been in India for over two months, and I still feel like I am floundering at times when it comes to ""common"" courtesy. I mean, obviously there are certain rules of politeness that apply to all peoples, but I have often found myself reacting negatively to something which is completely acceptable in India, or doing something that we would find acceptable in America but is absolutely wrong in India.

Of course I knew that there would be differences in polite proximity, and differences in how queues are handled (I cannot count how many people have budged me in line because I left two feet of space between myself and the person ahead of me). But there were also things that I did not expect: being followed by the hotel owners in Hampi (see ""Humming in Hampi"" if you have no idea what I'm talking about), different head gestures, removing (or not removing) shoes, bargaining, and different exclamations, to name a few.

For those of you who will be interacting with me my first couple of weeks back from India, be warned: I have picked up new mannerisms. One of these is what I am terming the ""okay gesture."" It can be very confusing to someone who does not know this gesture exists, because it most closely resembles a head-shake, but is used at times when Americans typically would nod or not do anything. It often accompanies the word ""okay,"" and basically shows neutrality toward the subject at hand. It was explained to me on my first day by Cathy, a 12th grader, when she replied to a request with, ""Okay"" and the okay gesture, and I responded, ""So, not okay? You're giving me mixed messages."" I have since been working to re-wire my gut response when I see the okay gesture (No, although this student scowls when he does the okay gesture, he is not disgreeing... Although this staff member sounds angry, the okay gesture means she is actually showing assent...). For instance, if a student asks me if they can be excused to go to the toilet, I'll say, ""Yes, you may,"" but use the okay gesture to accompany it because I'm not THAT adamant that they go use the toilet. On the flip side, when I ask my students if they understand something, they may respond with the okay gesture to assure me that they think they grasp the concepts, but that that revelation is not overly exciting.

When it comes to the question of whether or not to remove one's shoes, I am still in the dark. As a tourist, the general rule of thumb is: take them off if you see other shoes at the door. Of course, that doesn't always work. For Diwali, I went to a saree-distribution ceremony (in which all of the maintenance staff received gifts from The George Foundation), and I decided to remove my shoes because I saw many pairs of shoes at the door. But when I got inside, Ms. Beena immediately called out in horror, ""Lynn! Don't come in your bare feet!"" and I had to scamper outside to get my shoes back on before taking my seat with Lizzy and Peter. Apparently all of those shoes belonged to the maintenance staff, and everyone else there kept their shoes on. But, in general, that hasn't been a problem elsewhere. In Hampi especially, it was accepted that one removes one's shoes at the door of any shop or restaurant (as long as the restaurant did not have a dirt floor). But there were also places that surprised me, like in Hyderabad. Peter and I had to take our shoes off to go into a particular museum gallery of prints, and then again when we entered a room with an Egyptian mummy. We speculated that the latter had to do with the dead remains, but the only explanation we could think of for the first gallery was that the room contained several Quarans.

Bargaining is something that always feels uncomfortable for me. I've gotten better at it, especially with rickshaw drivers, but it really goes against the grain of my upbringing. Especially when I am bargaining for a handicraft from the artisan him- or herself, I feel like I am insulting their time and effort. In general, though, they seem to be content once a deal is struck. The only time I have seen an artisan blatantly refuse to bargain below a certain price was with a painter in Hampi. And, to be perfectly honest, we had seen the detailwork and time he put into each piece, and if I had put that much time into something, I would also refuse a low offer--whether or not it was the off-season. But before now, I never understood the power of walking away. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but this tool alone has saved me from many outrageously overpriced rickshaw rides. I like to imagine that I'll be able to use this skill when I make my next big purchase at home. (Car salesmen in 10 years, watch out!)

One of the other things I have had to get used to are different exclamations. Only now are these beginning to rub off on me, as I only hear them when someone is frustrated or distressed (which is happening more now that term exams are approaching). The most common exclamation is a drawn out, ""I-o!"" (pronounced ""aye-OH""). I was shocked when I first heard this because it is so similar to some of the original exclamations used in Medea. For those of you who do not know, I directed Medea last spring with the Meiningens Student Theatre Group, and the translation we used included many of the original exclamations (so, instead of the Nurse crying the melodramatic ""Woe!"" to the heavens, she cries ""Yoh!""). In rehearsal, the actors worked hard to instill emotion into such unfamiliar phrases, and it never occurred to me that something similar was used in contemporary times. I'm trying to incorporate it into my speech, because it seems to fill that gap that Americans only fill with sighing or huffing, but it still comes out rather clunkily--much to my student's amusement, I'm sure. I may not pick this one up fully, but I appreciate its expressiveness.

The long and short of it, I suppose, is that although I sometimes struggle to communicate clearly, I am always learning!

The Design
I know I promised that my next blog was going to be about different adventures in communication, but I guess that one will come next.

Today is the last Saturday before the big end-of-the term push, and the tension is palpable, especially with the upper grades. So--as I am apt to do when I feel deadlines and stress looming ahead--I intentionally took part of the day off to enjoy myself. But instead of going into Bangalore with everyone else (believe me, I'll be going into Bangalore plenty of times in the next three weeks), I decided to stay at SB and get some mehndi.

It is almost a rite of passage for volunteers to have mehndi done for them by the students. Mehndi is the Tamil word for the English henna (or, really, I should be writing this vice-versa--I'm pretty sure the Tamil word came first), and is a red-brown paste that, when applied properly, dyes your skin for around 2 or 3 weeks. It is sold in cones, like those used for professional-quality frosting, to ease application and therefore allow for complex designs.

My tattoo artist was Shilpa, a seventh grader who is taking voice lessons from
Shilpa

me. We decided to settle in the music room, where it was quieter and not as sunny. Several other students filtered through as we went, offering advice and company. Janani, another 7th grader, played with my hair for quite some time while Shilpa worked. Janani taught me how to make my hair look longer by putting it in a high ponytail, but leaving a small clump out at the nape of the neck. That way your hair looks at least four inches longer. I asked her what would happen if I tilted my head to the side, revealing the clump of hair, and she pursed her lips like an exasperated artist and said, ""You have to just...keep your head straight."" Others who dropped in were very interested with my mini toolkit, which I had removed from my bag for the scissors. And others busied themselves with my music.

For those of you unfamiliar with the mehndi process, it is a long one: Applying the detail-work for just my palm took over half an hour, and then you have to let it dry. After you let it dry, you have to re-moisten the ink with sugar water (I have no
The Mehndi Crew
idea why). Then you have to let it dry again. And then you re-wet it. And let it dry. Eventually, you rub the paste off and the dye remains.

Of course, when you have a group of children getting the sugar, they get about five times what is needed. And, when that happens, they sacrifice themselves and eat the excess. I felt it was my duty to take on some of the burden as well, but I was at the disadvantage of having hands covered in drying mehndi. So, Thulasi, who understood how much I hate to shirk my duties, spoon-fed me my portion.

All in all, it was nice to just spend time with the students, and talk about non-school related things. After I scraped off all of the dried paste, I had to dive back into writing term exams, which are due to Lizzy tomorrow morning. But now if I find myself getting too stressed, I can distract myself for a while with Shilpa's lovely designs.

Two 8th Graders & Me
These are two of the 8th graders with whom I went birdwatching.
I walked into my 12th grade class today and my students had written the following on the board: ""Happy Thanksgiving Miss Linn ! Thank you for: -Teaching us -Sharing your talent."" It warmed my heart.

It didn't occur to me when I planned this trip how much I would miss Thanksgiving with my family. Here at SB, the American volunteers have had a lot of conversations about the gastronomical losses: no turkey, no stuffing, and certainly no green bean casserole. At least for me, this is a kind of façade. It is far easier to discuss the food that I'm missing than to discuss the overheated kitchen, the cat's chirps (she would love some of that turkey), the smell of applecrisp, the pile of still-cold jackets, and the Simon and Garfunkel playing in the background. And food is definitely an easier topic than discussing the laughter, the cribbage victories and losses, the warmth of being with so many people in such a small place, the hugs, and the security. No gifts to worry about. No decorations. Just a secure sense of ""us.""

But I've traded all of that in this year, for better or worse. I figured that since
Bounty from Bangalore
Sometimes, I am so grateful that I can reach for a good book (and nutella).
I'd be home (and recovered from jet-lag) in time to celebrate Christmas, I would have plenty of opportunity to enjoy my family and friends. But Thanksgiving is beautiful in its simplicity. I'm sure this is a claim that will make many-a-cook scoff. (""Have you ever tried to cook a whole turkey?"" they may ask. To which I'd reply, ""No, but I've tried to cook around a whole turkey."" If you've ever been to a holiday in my mother's kitchen, you'd understand.) But, honestly, how often do we actively gather simply to give thanks for what we have? For me, at least, not often enough.

So, although (or maybe because) I am gathering with a new and different family this Thanksgiving, I wanted to share a list of things I am grateful for, both at home and here in India, and in no particular order.

1) My families: One night at dinner, upon asking how many siblings a girl had, she smiled and said, ""I have a younger sister."" I was about to ask the next child at the table when the girl continued, ""And I have her and her and her and him..."" as she pointed to each
The Flower and the Bud
Doesn't it look a bit like a pink porcupine?
child at the table. Then she looked at me, and smiled a wonderfully toothy grin. ""And now I have you. All part of my Shanti Bhavan family."" I love that attitude, and cannot help but think of how many different families have supported/adopted/tolerated me over the years. In case I don't say it enough: Friends, old and new, you mean the world to me.

2) Education: My own, my teacher's, and my students'. I lump this all together because, quite frankly, I'm grateful for our capacity and desire to learn and discover. I went birdwatching with the 8th-grade girls yesterday and was pleasantly surprised by how excited they were to stand at the edge of the lake (really just a pond right now) and look at egrets and ducks through binoculars. They were yelling, ""Look! Look at that duck! It's so cool!"" and I realized that, yes, ducks are cool, if you look at them closely enough. And, as we were walking, I noticed this georgeous set of crepuscular rays (those thin rays of light that looks a bit like a spotlight from God) and told the girls. Immediately, they were asking me what crepuscular means, and how to spell it. Throughout the rest of the walk they would occassionally check with me that they were saying it correctly. I am so thankful to not only constantly be learning, but to also be in a position where I can regularily engage the curiosity of the next generation.

3) Food: It has to be on here. Whether I am scooping up rice with my fingers and a piece of chapatti or I'm balancing salmon on the back of my fork, I am so glad to experience so many varieties of food. My horizons are ever-expanding: I used to be very wary of spicy foods, and now I eat it comfortably every day. I didn't have any idea what gobi manchurian or poori or real chutney was--all I knew was a sweet and sour mango chutney--but (look out, world!) I'm now determined to learn to make them, too. And that leads really well into:

4) Diversity: I didn't appreciate it much until now, but the world would be SO BORING if we didn't have such a diverse set of cultures. There's so much I didn't know I didn't know, like how there are trees with flowers that look like pink porcupines. Or, how male friends in India feel comfortable holding hands. Or, how the custard apple looks like something you put in your closets to keep moths away but is actually quite edible. And, while I'm on the note of diversity, I wanted to express my gratitude for how many wonderful ways there are to express oneself. Sure, I'm teaching the students choir and drama, but there's also the little things--new gestures and mannerisms that I am excited to add to my own repetoire. (Don't worry, there will be a more specific blog on this, coming soon.)

5) Technology: Some people, before I came here, told me that I was ""brave"" for doing this. I don't know how to quantify brave, but I can tell you that I am not nearly as brave as those people who travelled long distances before me. I'm lucky enough to have instant access to those I love through the internet. I'm also lucky to have a journey that lasts only slightly over 24 hours each way, and solar power on the path as I go back to my room every night. I'm lucky to be staying in a place where I can get water through plumbing even in my second-floor room. I'm lucky to have rickshaws and cars that can take me into Hosur and Bangalore every now and again to get supplies and a different sort of meal. I don't know what this says about me, but had these assurances not been in place, I doubt I would have chosen to come here. So, I'm thankful for them because they have afforded me the opportunity to experience India.

There's much more I could write, but the list could go on for cyber-miles (yes, I made that up). So, suffice it to say that I am so thankful for each and every one of you, and I wish you all the happiest of Thanksgivings.

Tirupati-Tirumala Devasthanam




Our trip to Tirupati was made possible by reducing one day at Port Blair.

Tirupati-Balaji is the temple of Lord Krishna or 'Govindaa'. One of the busiest and richest temples in India.

After returning from Port Blair, we took a taxi to Tirupati from Chennai. Chennai to Tirupati and back is possible in one day (~ 20 hours) but it is better to be on a safer side and keep two days (at least one and half days).

Distance from Chennai (airport) to Tirupati is 180 km and from Internet we had learned that it will take about 3.5 hours. It took us almost six hours! Road from Chennai to this famous temple is practically non-existent. It is under construction (God Balaji only knows since when...) and will take another couple of years to complete. Such delays can totally disrupt your tour planning. We had expected to reach by 3 pm and we reached after 5 pm.

Main temple is on the top of the hill. At the base is the town of Tirupati. The climb takes 30 min through excellent road (16 km). Roads for going up and coming down are different that makes them safe.

Darshan at Tirumala are in three categories:

(1) Free

(2) Queue for Rs. 50/-

(3) Queue for Rs. 300/-. On different days of the week the queue for Rs. 300/- opens for different hours. In this queue, Lord Balaji gives you appointment at a fixed hour and you don't have to wait in the queue for more than 3 hours. You can rest in your hotel room and come at the appointed hour.

Free Darshan are open round the clock.

Reaching Tirumala (top of the hill) at 5 pm made all the difference. Tickets for Rs. 50/- were closed and so also the Rs. 300/- quota. Rs. 300/- quota would open at 9.00 am next day.

Lord Balaji wanted us to meet through the common man's route. And we didn't have a choice.

We joined the Free Darshan system (yes it should be called a 'system'😉 at around 6.15 in the Vaikuntham Queue Complex. After half an hour of terrible jostling and pushing, we passed through the security gate and we were directed in to a big CAGE. They call it HALL. It is a stepped room with metal grill walls on all four sides (hence I prefer to call it cage). It was cage (hall) no. 9. There are more than such 30 cages. Each cage can accommodate nearly 400 devotees. To our surprise, as soon as we entered the cage, every one (who was experienced) spread out their sheets of clothes and prepared to sleep. Before we could understand anything, the cage was full and it was locked from outside!

There was a huge TV screen showing the activities in the Sanctum sanctorum live. Some privileged neta was performing pooja and priests were chanting shlokas in local language.

On the notice board was written: Time of sitting: 14th November, 6.40 pm. Expected time for Darshan, 15th November, 9.00 pm! We were explained that sometimes it takes more than 24 hours of waiting in free darshan.

We felt trapped!

However, there is a mechanism to temporarily leave the cage by registering at the photometric registration system. We missed it because the announcement was made in local language.

Around 9 pm, devotees woke up and rushed to the back of the cage to collect their portion of daal-rice served free by the temple. The cage filled with the aroma of daal-rice. We prayed to be saved from some daal-rice dropping on us! Everything became quiet after some time.

By 10 pm it became very cold and we didn't have extra clothes to protect us. We were without dinner and had very little water. We were looking for the volunteers to unlock the cage and take us out. We had almost decided to quit - without Darshan.

At 10.30 whistles started blowing and suddenly it became clear that our lot will be taken for Darshan. Devotees ran pushing each other and chanting 'Govidaa'. We passed through a maze of queue system for next hour. On the way, there was another queue system for collecting coupons for 'laddus'.

Finally we reached the main temple around 11.30. There we didn't have to make any effort to move forward. We simply floated through the main temple with the help of pushes from the more devoted devotees. Our Darshan part was over in less than a second, after waiting in the queue for 5 hours.

Queues didn't end there. We were to go to another building where 'laddus' were handed over in return for coupons. Can you imagine who were doing this job? More than 20 India's top leading Banks!! I am at loss to understand what they were doing and why? Why banks were involved in laddu distribution?

The entire Darshan ritual ended at 12.30 past midnight.

The TTD (Tirupati-Tirumala-Devasthanam) must be given full credit for making all possible efforts to maintain order and provide as much facilities to the visitors as possible. In the cages, huge ventilation systems were working efficiently. It never felt congested or smelly. Toilets were clean and dry (a big surprise!). RO drinking water was available. Volunteers were poilte and courteous. The problem is with the devotees: their number and their behaviour. Inspite of having 33 crore devatas (Gods) as per Hindu mythology, Lord Balaji has to take such a load! HE is available 24x7. Number cannot be restricted - we were also a part of those thousands. But the behaviour! Every devotee wanted to go ahead of the other! There is no shame in fighting to go ahead of others in the temple.

Next on the agenda was to search for room to stay at night. None were available. All the accommodations are managed by the Temple authority and are booked in advance.

We decided to climb down the hill and stay in some hotel at Tirupati (there are many there). But no! It would not be possible before 3 am. Road to go down remains closed from 12 midnight to 3 am. After spending few hours in the car, we proceeded to find a hotel at 4.30 am to rest for a few hours before proceeding to Chennai to catch return flight to Ahmedabad.

You have to be a true devotee to visit Tirupati again.

Welcome
So after Alleppey we caught a train to Trivandrum and stayed at the YMCA for a night. We managed to find a hotel that served a cool beer and ended up watching the start of the Diwali festival and fireworks from the rooftop of the hotel (I told Jess the fireworks had been planned in advance for her! Smooth ay! 😊 ) We then caught a train to Tirunevelli where SCAD is based while Diwali Festival was still in full swing . . .

We have been here for two days and there is a lot to take in. SCAD helps people who have been cast out of society for lots of different reasons. I could not believe the size of the campus! It’s like a massive university campus that houses a polytechnic, college, engineering college, nursing college, facilities for young people with learning and mental difficulties and a 14 acre plot of land used to grow plants and trees for the purpose of organic farming that is shipped out to local farming communities.

We visited a gypsy camp where they have developed a school to give the kids a chance of education, there were some characters there and
YMCA
the kids sang for us. We then visited a village where people with leprosy live. Before this people with leprosy were seen as outcasts and in one story we heard how a woman had been shut out by her husband and kids and left to fend for herself!

Today we have worked alongside people in the physiotherapy and speech therapy ward. We have spent time with children from the mental health ward too and got to know them. Their English is brilliant and there are some real characters there who are really friendly and just want to get to know you. There is a young girl there who was found abandoned at a bus stop and became an elected mute due to what happened to her before SCAD took her in, she communicates through different vocal sounds, is always smiling and has adopted Jess 😉

Children's Day Banner
These are real flowers and greens!
This week is the ultimate of holiday weeks in India, and let me tell you: Shanti Bhavan certainly knows how to throw a party! We only have two days of school off (November 13 for Diwali and November 14 for Children's Day), but the celebrations started on Saturday, and I cannot express how lucky I feel to be a part of them.

First off: Children's Day. One of the best holidays I have ever experienced. It's officially on Wednesday (on Nehru's birthday), but we celebrated early so staff members could participate and still go home for Diwali. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, going into Saturday. There was a lot of prep-work: For weeks in advance we (the volunteers and staff) would hold little secret night ""meetings,"" which were actually short, overheated, often candle-lit rehearsals. We were expected to put together a performance of some sort, with choreographed dances, songs, and skits. We handmade a card for each of the 200+ students. We chipped in money to buy a bag of chips for each child.

This was fun enough, but I think I initially approached the whole idea of Children's Day in a very American way. As one
""I'm Not That Smart
volunteer put it, whenever she asked her mother why there wasn't a Children's Day in the US when there was a Mother's Day, her mother would reply, ""Every day is Children's Day."" I thought it was a cute idea, and one that I could get behind, but I couldn't help but also feel that we were working every day for the students, and after especially long days with them, it was sometimes difficult to motivate preparing extra entertainment for them.

But the thing about a school like Shanti Bhavan is that, no matter how much energy teachers may put into helping and caring for their students, there is never enough love to go around for each individual student. Much of the time students have to depend on each other for individual attention, and although that is good in its own way, it is also important for the adults to remind the kids that they are willing to do anything--even to be extremely silly onstage--for their students, because they love them. I cannot express how the youngest children's eyes brightened when they saw the cards with their names on them. They carried those cards with them for the rest of
Cathy and Me
the day and asked various adults to read and re-read the form letter inside.

The performance was a wonderfully eclectic mix of traditional and hip-hop dance, skits (in English and in Hindi or Tamil), and song. All of the adults--even the graduates, visiting during their semester breaks--helped out in some way. I ended up dancing in the volunteers' rendition of ""Gangnam Style"" and ""Bare Necessities"" (which I choreographed), singing ""I'm Not That Smart"" from 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee, and doing a brief bit in a teacher's dance. I also acted in a skit where all of the volunteers pretended to be the students and Ms. Beena, the Vice-Principal, was the teacher. I was the whiny child who bellows ""Mi-i-i-i-i-i-iss!"" every time I felt some injustice occurred. I also threw in the occassional ""PJ!"", which stands for ""Poor joke!"", but is often used in completely innappropriate contexts (like when students feel something is unfair). There was also the pencil-sharpener, the arguers, the jellyfish, and the sleeper. Needless to say, the skit ended with Ms. Beena giving us all ragi-ball for dinner (the common punishment here for misbehavior). The kids loved it (one of the 11th graders fell out
The Centerpiece
of his seat, I hear).

At the end of the day, we watched Brave, which is SO much better when you're watching with children. The best part was the fact that Merida, the main character, says the phrase, ""It's unfair!"" a dozen times, and that was another phrase we used frequently in our skit. So the students really enjoyed those moments.

And now today is Diwali, the Festival of the Lights. The day has been a relaxed one; the students had virtually no responsibilities, so I spent time singing in the music room with Vinceya, a senior, and Pushpa, a graduate. Brinda, another senior, played piano for us. Vinceya is one of my voice students (and English, of course), and although she cannot read music, she has a good ear and a fine, soprano voice. I look forward to seeing how she develops in the next month as we work on some Phantom of the Opera together.

The rest of my day was spent reading, sorting my belongings, and taming my sticky attempt at curled hair. The first two I managed just fine by myself, but the latter required some help from Cathy, another senior. Apparently, women
Sparklers!
are expected to wear ""new sarees"" for Diwali, but I did not want to because past volunteers have singed their sarees on the firecrackers (not to mention I would have to borrow a saree). So, instead, I promised to make myself look as nice as possible with what I had. Well, what I had was bobby pins and some hair spray some other volunteer left, but I soon discovered that the hairspray was crappy. My hair feels goey. But Cathy was gracious enough to french braid my hair very nicely and turn a mess into something fancy.

In any case, at 6:30 p.m., we all gathered to see a couple of dances (learned today from music videos, I believe). And then we went to the dining hall, which the intrepid 11th graders had decorated and re-arranged. Little lanterns were everywhere, leading to a beautiful display in the center of the hall. It was so beautiful, seeing everyone moving in their sarees and fancy kurtas in the firelight. I tried to take a few pictures, but then Sebastian, a 7th grader, asked if he could use my camera. This is common, and likely the best way to get really good
Flowerpots!
pictures at SB. He was the first of three students who borrowed my camera over the night. I'm not sure who took which pictures, but I am certainly grateful for them all.

Dinner was coriander rice with potato, and dessert was a gelatinous sweet. Then, the ""crackers"" were taken out. Not only sparklers and loud firecrackers, no, but also what appeared to me like sure instruments of death. There were flat, round crackers that you lit and then spun so it would send sparks in a whirl over your shoes. There were ""flowerpots,"" which sent fountains of sparks ten feet high. The field behind the dining hall was thick with smoke and children, and I now have a new understanding of Civil War battlefield imagery.

In general I stayed out of the chaos, but that made me anxious, too, because I was there to be with the kids, and how can I connect if I remain aloof to one of their favorite days? So, when Gayathri, one of the 11th graders, asked if I wanted to light a flowerpot, I agreed. Heck, I'm in India, right? Why not? So she goes off to find a lantern with which
I Have No Clue! (but dangerous!)
I can light this monstrous cracker (it's a cone as big as my hand), and then we find a clearing in the field. I tried to light it, but although the top caught fire, it went out before anything happened. So, I tried again, with the same result. At this point, I'm really nervous--what if there is no wick left and my hand explodes off when I put the flame to it?--but the kids seem unconcerned, and tell me to try a third time. ""Hold the flame there until the white comes out!"" they told me. Apparently, ""the white"" means a warning flash of foot-high white sparks. Upon seeing this, I ran back with my lantern, and I only momentarily glimpsed the red and green of my flowerpot going off. And, of course, since my back was turned, a spark landed on me. The kids seemed impervious to the sparks (or maybe they just were good at avoiding them). I'm satisfied to report, though, that both me and my clothes came out of Diwali fully intact, without any scorch marks. Success, if I do say so myself.

I think my favorite moment of the night, though, was the small fireworks show at the end. For five minutes, the chaos stopped, and everyone in the field looked up into the sky. Two girls were standing on chairs next to me, and for every single one, they whispered, ""That's beautiful."" These fireworks weren't huge or specially designed or very colorful, but it was the best display I've ever seen. How often does a person get to see so many people that she loves appreciating, in awe and stillness, something that they love? That's the image that I'll always remember about Diwali.

Published: October 29th 2012


Tea Plantation at Coonoor
We reached Coonoor on a cloudy noon in the last week of October. It was drizzling over the valleys but not raining. We three (my wife, son and myself) checked in Hotel Vivek where we had booked a room thru net. It was slightly interior to the main roads, situated in upper Coonoor near Upasi at Figure of 8 Road and after calling the hotel we could locate the place. There was a restaurant also in the premises called Green Field and we had our lunch there.



Coonoor is a calm and quiet place where there is no crowd, rush and noises unlike Ooty. You can spend a lazy day here for sight seeing or simply walking thru the greenery or visiting the view points and the park.



After the meals we first visited Sims Park, the botanical garden which was around two kilometers from the hotel. Though we feared the rain would spoil the day, fortunately there was no further rainfall. It is a large park spread over acres of land having full of flowers and variety of plants and trees. Many of the trees are very old and rare. There is a lake
Inside Sim's Park
inside the park where one can go for boating. We spent almost two hours there wandering thru the meadows.



In front of Sims park there is a junction, the road from Coonoor town goes in two opposite directions, one leads to Kotagiri and the other towards Willington Cantonment area. There are a few small fruits and vegetables shops and tea stalls located in the junction. Opposite to the park stands the famous Pasteur Institute, producing anti-rabies vaccine. However now-a-days it is not open to the public for visit. There is a narrow road parallel to the park which leads to a tea factory where production process of tea can be witnessed and various types of tea can be purchased by the visitors. Since we have already seen the same in Munnar we didn’t opt for this destination.



Then we planned to have a rounding thru lower Coonoor. It is more crowded as the Coonoor municipal bus stand, market etc are situated here. There are a number of shops congested in this area. There is one vegetarian hotel Sri Lakshmi near to the bus stand. There are a few bakeries such as Crown Bakery,
Path way in the park
New Indian Bakery (two branches). As we heard about the tasty biscuits available in these bakeries we shopped in the New Indian Bakery, had some coockies and varkies (a snack available in Ooty, Coonor hill stations). The latter seemed to be ordinary, but if you had the experience in your childhood, of tasting those simple but tasty biscuits displayed in the glass jars in your village shop, you would definitely like these biscuits too.



Next we visited Coonoor market, consisting full of small pathways where you will lose the direction and the way behind you, as the narrow paths are countless and cross cutting and crowded also. A large number of tiny shops and stalls selling fruits, vegetables, grocery, cloths, leather items, and a lot more are seen in the market. Viewing from the main roads outside the market you may not guess the complexity inside the market. Hence it would be a nice experience to enter into and to exit this place!



We then planned to head towards Lamb’s Rock, a view point about 7 kms far from Coonoor on the way to Dolphin’s Nose, another view point situated 12 kms fom the
A view from Lamb's Rock
town. As it was not a sunny day and it was already evening we had to drop the idea of visiting Dolphin Nose which would be covered by fog by the time we reach there. Hence we moved to the Lamb’s Rock.



It is a beautiful viewpoint on the rocks surrounded by large trees and plants which create the atmosphere of a small forest. There are two walk-paths, one to climb uphill and the other to come back. On the top there is a pillar, steps are provided so that one can easily climb the same and have the scenic beauty of surrounding valleys and mist spreading here and there.



Since it was nearing twilight we started our return trip to the town. It was getting very cold and we came back to the hotel for dinner without further wanderings.



Next day morning after breakfast we went near Sim’s park and drove towards Wellington. It is a Cantonment Board area where the Defence Services Staff College is situated and also a picturesque location. Green meadows are flood on both sides of the road. There is a Golf club by the side
Another view from Lamb's Rock
of the road. We spent some time there to take a few snaps.



Coming back to Sims park junction we drove a few kilometers towards Kotagiri area. This was also a route with nice sceneries. On the way we found a small temple on the uphill side of the road which was named ‘Chinna Tirupathy’ as it was Sree Venkiteswara Temple. We had a visit there and felt a nice atmosphere there. Interestingly the poojary (performer of rituals) of the temple was a young fellow who had his MBA done and was undergoing management consultancy as told to us.



There was a water fall called Law’s falls near to Coonoor, however on enquiry we have been advised that in the rainy time it would be slippery and hence not approachable. The other water falls which we heard was Catherine falls, which was situated in Kotagiri.



As it was nearing noon we went back to the hotel. It was time to check out and go for our next destination. The time we spent in Coonoor was swift and awesome nice and we bid farewell to this scenic township, Sayanora!

shore temple 1
A straight road to Mahabaliburam from Chennai took us about an hour drive, hot day it was, dust, dust, dust, flying everywhere, low flat lands, from shops, houses to nice bungalows along the way, a better sight compared the city. A stretch of brown sandy beach on my left hand side about a mile away, quite enticing, wanting to take a dip in that blue cool waters of Bengal Bay.

We reached a tourist spot, lots of shops displaying paintings, statues of Gods, costume jewelries, making of leather sandals and slippers and granite carvings are quite nice to watch, and a rare treat for me after so many days in India I finally see some cottage industries that I long for. Believe it or not I bought a pair of slippers. Come on!...we need to support local products. Some stayed below the trees, lazed in the heat, waiting for customers. I walked further to the beach, had to buy a ticket to the Mahabaliburam Shore Temple on the sandy beach. A beautiful old temple some 1400 years ago, protruded out from the sandy beach, like a kingdom out of nowhere but simply amazing, believe to be Lord Shiva when I
shore temple 2
peek into the shrine, surrounded by many sculpted statues of Gods, Lord Durga on the Lion and Nandi, with a narrow passage rounding the temple telling me how cool it was when I am in between the walls scouting nice angles for my camera. I felt glad. Even more than glad, this large complex of temples were uncovered by 2004 Tsunami and the best part is that more areas of the temple were being investigated and recovered many artifacts and statues from the sea, likely more to see in the near future.

I could see the Indian kids and adults climbed up and down; seem like a playground for all ages which amuses me with a quirk on my lips end. Wondered why not the Europeans, Japanese and I did not follow suit.

We then took a 10 minutes drive to the next spot, to where lay another greater attraction of Mahabaliburam. The cave temple with sculpted statues on the walls, a huge place where it took us at least a two hours walk up and around the hill. Some ruins were scattered on the hill with a light house on the far end right hand side facing
shore temple 3
the sea. All these great statues were carved from the granite hill. Some of the intricate sculptures on the pillars and walls are still intact that all these are protected by the UNESCO. These were built in the 7th-9th century. There are Arjuna’s penance sculptures, also known as the Descent of the Ganges with families of elephants and monkeys. Mahishamardini is filled with Lord Shiva, Parvati and Lord Murugan’s sculptures. Impressive sculptures of Vishnu, Gakalakshmi, Trivikama and Lord Durga can be found in Varaha Cave.

A gigantic round rock is one of the great features. It is known as the Krishna’s Butter Ball. How did it landed there……beats me. Just do not rest below the rock, can be a shady place but anytime you can be a flat piece of dough with tomato sauce oozing out from all sides. No joke. Take my advise.

Air India has a reputation of being completely no-frills and that, it certainly was. Our plane arrived into Dubai an hour late and so we left there an hour late. Interestingly, whiskey was apparently free on board and so quite a number of the menfolk enjoyed the priviledge. Got into Chennai at 5:30AM. Chennai is toridly hot. Sweltering is another good word for it. Being a northern-born girl, I do not like it. Dry heat I can deal with, its the high humidity that gets me. Anant's parents do not have air conditioning, only a couple strong ceiling fans. Still, it is sweaty, sticky hot.

Anyway, Sundaram-uncle is hosting the 9-day Navratri festival at his house and adjoining Sri Ananda Lakshmi Mandir in Mylapore. So after a quick breakfast at home, we headed over to the Mandir and stayed until lunch. Lunch was served traditional South Indian style on a banana leaf. Good home-cooked food! Since we will be gone during astami and navami day when ladies are usually given sarees, I got a saree early. It is quite nice, a red silk blend with orange border. The afternoon was spent shopping for Indian clothes and visiting the first of

One night we went for dinner at the Park Sheraton hotel. A young man and some of his friends came to sit a table near us. Turned out, the young man is Dhanush, a well-known Indian actor. Anant's cousin, who was with us, pointed out this fact. Anant shook his hand but I do not have pictorial evidence of the encounter. Oh well! Then, just the day before, a famous Indian singer was sitting in the car next to ours. Small glimpses of the rich and famous. Lucky us, I suppose.

On 21 October, we will fly Indigo Airlines to Bhubaneshwar, Orissa. We will spend a day and a half there before boarding an overnight train over to the western side of the state to Rourkela. Rourkela is where Anant grew up and is ""home"" for him. He was last there almost 22 years ago.

Stay tuned. Next stop: Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack.

Theatre Games
A riotous game of ""WAH!""
Okay, I'll admit that this entry has a cheesy and almost nonsensical title, but I didn't want to say ""Raiders of the Lost Arts"" because, according to Dictionary.com, raider is ""a person who seizes control of a company, as by secretly buying stock and gathering proxies."" (Okay, that's definition #4, but in any case, raider is not an appropriate term for the atmosphere I want to create.) So, I am justifying my title choice by pointing out that my students are both literate andartistic, sometimes even in the same class (like today, but more on that later).

Sorry I haven't been writing too much, but classes have been busy, and I have been gathering materials to show all of you what's been happening. Basically, these past couple of weeks have been marked by the resurgence of the arts in my life (and the life of Shanti Bhavan). They (the arts) returned with a vengance, and I have to admit that at times they have already kicked me in the tush. This is what I've been training for, what I CAME for, and it's still proving to be more challenging than teaching English. But I think the rewards will be double-fold,
Choir
A fuzzy/dark picture, but here's the choir.
too.

It started with the unsteady return of theatre classes. We had a couple before these past weeks, but International Day of the Girl-Child made it nearly impossible to keep a regular schedule. Originally, I wanted to have two groups: 8-12 grade and 4-7 grade. But the 8-12 graders didn't come, I think because they would be missing PT (the only time they get to play outside). And the 4-7 graders? It's a MASSIVE group of about fifty kids, so I split them up instead, but even twenty-five is hard to handle because my theatre class is scheduled right after their academic classes. I am flattered that they choose to do my theatre class, but the 4-5th graders especially lack focus at that time. A couple weeks back, we gained a new volunteer, Rebecca, who is also a theatre artist, and I immediately recruited her to help me because I had already held the first class (with all fifty students, heaven help me!) and knew that I needed support. It runs far more easily with her, and the kids are more responsive with two sets of eyes.

That said, here's what we're doing: I am really interested in exploring the basics of devised theatre with the students (a theatrical method of creating a performance that is used by the Children's Theatre Company Theatre Arts Training program quite a bit). We invited students to come in with folk-tales that they have heard and tell the folk-tale to the class. Then we broke into groups and during the next class put together small skits based on the folktales. The ultimate goal is to pick a folk-tale and bring everyone together to make the folk-tale come to life. Depending on the 6-7 graders' interest, we may then play around with the story, asking and answering questions onstage that are left unsaid in the text. I'm looking forward to creating a piece, and I hope that this may help them get beyond their various ""blocks""--whether it's fear/derision of the opposite gender, or embarrassment, or lack of collaborative experience.

Choir, too, started these past couple of weeks. Cathy and Vinceya, two of the dedicated choir seniors, maintained the choir while there was no teacher. I'm not sure how long this teacher-less period was, but I get the feeling that they are grateful to relinquish the class to me. They are still wonderfully helpful--I am still struggling with non-11th and -12th grade names, and so they act as my extra eyes when it comes to keeping everyone on-task. This is very much appreciated, especially because I am asking a lot more of the students than they are used to. As far as I can tell, they have not done harmonies in years, if ever. So, I'm starting them on a simple Jay Althouse arrangement of ""Homeward Bound"" (not the Simon and Garfunkel, but similarly folksey) with two parts. It is slow-going, especially with only two 45-minute rehearsals a week, but they are starting to pick it up, which is exhilarating. I've also started to teach them solfege exercises, and soon hope to add warm-up songs with built-in harmonies (thirds and fifths). I've been told to start anticipating Christmas, so I'm thinking of buying them (with my remaining fundraised-money) ""Carol of the Bells"" or some other simple Christmas piece with enough copies for each of them to actually see the music. I also need to find something German, apparently, which is tradition for the Christmas party.

I'm also really excited to say that I will be starting an Advanced Choir this weekend, which will be exclusively for the 11th and 12th grade choir folks. AND I will be starting four private and two small-group lessons on the side. I cannot express how anxious but delighted I am to have this opportunity. Some of you, my readers, may have noted that I recently put up a Facebook status that said, ""...Maybe I want to become a music teacher."" Maybe it's just the ""newness"" of the experience, but I feel invigorated when I leave choir rehearsal, and I hope that my students are enjoying their little victories as much as I am. I was recently helping one of my choir students with her vocabulary in morning prep (which is basically study hall), and she came to the word ""vivacious."" She looked at me and as her homework dictated, put it into a sentence: ""Miss Lynn is a vivacious teacher."" In a situation where I can't really poll the people I am serving about my effectiveness, I am taking that as a sign that I'm doing alright.

I've tried to pull the arts into my classroom, too, and this week a lot of that effort came to fruition. You see, in English, I am teaching under the idea that there are three levels of literary analysis: Level one is the gut reaction; level two is the critical analysis, and; level three is applying the literature to the world. We have been working steadily through piece after piece at the first and second level, and today I introduced the third. For my 11th graders, this came while we were studying Walt Whitman's ""I Sit and Look Out."" Here is the text, for those of you who have never read the poem:

I sit and look out upon all the sorrows of the world, and upon all
oppression and shame;
I hear secret convulsive sobs from young men, at anguish with
themselves, remorseful after deeds done;
I see, in low life, the mother misused by her children, dying,
neglected, gaunt, desperate;
I see the wife misused by her husband--I see the treacherous seducer
of young women;
I mark the ranklings of jealousy and unrequited love, attempted to be
hid--I see these sights on the earth;
I see the workings of battle, pestilence, tyranny--I see martyrs and
prisoners;
I observe a famine at sea--I observe the sailors casting lots who
shall be kill'd, to preserve the lives of the rest;
I observe the slights and degradations cast by arrogant persons upon
laborers, the poor, and upon negroes, and the like;
All these--All the meanness and agony without end, I sitting, look
out upon,
See, hear, and am silent.

I was unsurprised but slightly disappointed by the anthology's choice of using this, of all of Whitman's poems. Sure, I'll admit that teaching the sensual ""Song of Myself"" would have been uncomfortable with my students (who titter when I ask if someone had fallen ""in love"" or ""in lust""), but why does the alternative to sexuality always have to be painful and depressing pieces? My students agreed that they were sick of all these disheartening poems, and so we decided to re-write the poem, and ""Please, with happy things"" (as MK, one of my students, put it so eloquently). Each student wrote a line about what they see in their lives, and then we combined them. Of course, there was a disagreement regarding whether to show a progression from the negative to the positive or to intermingle the two, but we split the class according to preference (which actually turned out to be according to gender) and ended up with two beautiful pieces. Here is one, entitled ""We Sit and Look Out,"" written by the four gentlemen of the class:





We sit and look out upon the bittersweet world of pain and sorrow overpowered by love;

We look at the outside world and see slavery and poverty;

We see a priest performing his rituals while a beggar sits right in front, begging people for money to live her life;

We witness gunshots in response to the voice fighting for a cause greater than our own;

We see a father playing with his children, forgetting his sorrow and troubles;

We hear laughter as the children are entertained by the things they love;

We see a small plant no bigger than a pinky become a big, undefeated tree;

We sit and observe a brother caring for a sister, showering love upon her;

We see the world changing for better or worse cause;

All these—All the nightmares and sweet dreams are the things that make up human life.



Have I mentioned recently how much I love and admire these young people?

In any case, after we completed our poem, we also had a brilliant period of comparing Whitman's piece to Simon and Garfunkel's ""Sound of Silence."" We must have listened to the song five or six times, and by the end we were all singing and creating venn diagrams and generally feeling very literary. And then I got to repeat the process with the 12th graders, but with a short story called ""The Fly"" and Mumford and Son's cover of ""The Boxer.""

All in all, a good day to end a good couple of weeks.



P.S. The video uploader is being difficult right now, but I do intend to upload a small snippet of drama class for your viewing pleasure.

Lottys version;

After an extremely dusty, bumpy ride we arrived at the train station. Outside was a cow with the biggest horns I have ever seen in my life! He can't have been comfortable carrying those round on his head! We entered the station and were shown to the upper class waiting room to use the bathroom if we needed. We walked into the waiting room and the stench of stale urine hit us hard. We bravely continued, knowing we faced a 13 hour train ride where the toilets would probably be worse. In the toilets we peered into the cubicles and recoiled in horror. We had seen more western toilets than I expected, and we had also used squat toilets, but this was a tiled room with a tiny little hole in the corner, how on earth do you wee into that! needless to say we didn't go any further. We decided against joining the locals in walking across the tracks to get to the other platform and used the footbridge. Once over we were in a sea of Indians, how all those people fit on one train I don't know, although this is India and they are the
DSCF8698
masters at sharing personal space! We were told that we were sat in approximately the right position for our carriage, g15 but there was no guarantee that's where it would stop. There was a family of sixty all piling on in the same area and the train only stops for a limited time so when it does arrive we should run and get on any carriage and then worry about where we should be. I looked from my hundred kilo rucksack to Shaz and back again in disbelief... He wanted me to run... With that! We got ready, but obviously the train was late and unable to read Hindi we had a couple of false starts. When it was time to go we sprinted a few meters up the platform, implying he is a gentleman Planty hung back making sure all the girls got on, as the train pulled away I still couldn't see him in the madness and I just walked forward blindly! We found our seats, I found Planty and then we sat and took in our surroundings. The train was split into bays with 6 to a bay, the other side of the walk way was space
DSCF8702
for two more people, everything was open, I expected separate cabins but that was not the case. Plus Indians take so long to settle! Seriously how many times can you walk up and down the aisle? Our bay sleeping 6 consisted of two bench style seats that we sat on but also doubled as beds. A top bunk and a fold out shelf to really squeeze us in. There was little to no leg room sat down. We braved the toilet, deciding they had to be the best they'd ever be as it was the beginning. We got there and there was an Indian woman stood in the queue. ""Indian Indian"" she proclaimed. We just looked blankly, later we realised she meant these were the Indian squat toilets, the western were the other end. However we got a waft of the western one up the carriage and decided that because the Indians probably don't know how to use the western one properly and we were nearly certain using the squat one we weed straight onto the tracks, the Indian was probably the most hygienic! After taking it in turns to go and hold the door for each other as it
DSCF8707
had a tendency to swing open with the motion of the train we stumbled back to our group. After putting our pjs on and getting comfyish the guys played a few games of would you rather that included licking the train windows and disturbing the guy opposite who was the loudest snorer I have ever heard and the girls cringed in disgust. The train staff started bringing round food that we had all opted out of, (except for one who had eatern like a local from day one and suffered the consequences) being told Pringles and oreos were much more substantial for dinner. after about an hour of them walking round with different shades and consistancys of green goo and proclaiming what they were at the top of their lungs, the only noise was us laughing and the snoring guy, the rest of the carriage fell into a sort of stupor. We decided it was time to attempt a sleep so we put down the shelf beds and crawled into our spaces. The only way to lie was with bent legs so your feet didn't go over the edge. For this reason the tallest went at the top. I got
DSCF8709
a shelf bed, once in you couldn't sit up, or move around. For 30 rupees you could get a clean sheet, pillow and blanket. We opted out having silk sleeping bag liners that we had bought especially for the journey, at first I was jealous of the pillows and blankets, until the others started examining them and counting the types of bodily fluid stains, I knew I had made the right decision! I got to sleep pretty quickly considering where I was, and the only time I woke up was when Planty woke me to ask the time (thanks for that Planty!) and I slept for hours! I was prepared for a sleepless night however I didn't wake up until the train attendants woke the whole carriage individually shouting things like ""veg cutlet"" ""omelette"" and ""chai"" (the latter must have gone past at least 20 times!)

We got up, my whole body ached, I had in my wisdom, packed a change of clothes, toothbrush deodorant etc, I don't know what I expected, but there was none of that, we didn't even brave the bathroom to do our teeth. We looked out the window for abit at the biggest slums
DSCF8710
in Asia, then, before we could really absorb what we were seeing, it was all systems go again! We got off and into taxis, our driver went a couple of meters and then stopped to grab his breakfast, by which point I had made up my mind, I didn't like Mumbai at all! We drove through a narrow market, I knew this was not the slums but it wasn't far off. It was muggy and smelly and alive with people going about their daily lives, right there in the street. As the streets bettered I became more and more relieved about where we were staying! The hotel seemed ok at first glance. They had a greeter and the reception looked fairly modern. They had a table in the middle of it which also served as a fish tank, possibly made for goldfish and not the carp that were in it, but still! We were told our rooms were not ready and we were to be given one between 14 people to freshen up and leave our bags. We had a particularly nasty breakfast in a 1960s style restaurant. There was salt in the orange juice and tea was served in
DSCF8711
a flask, then a briefing, before being given 10 minutes to remove the dust from the Jeep ride and god knows what from the train ride and make ourselves presentable for a day sightseeing. The room we were given was to be someone’s room for the night, it had to be the smallest room in the world, with a tiny Indian sized door, beds that wouldn't look out of place in a nursery and a bathroom that had seen a good few guests! Needless to say I couldn't wait to see our room!

We all got into taxis for a day tour of Mumbai. our driver showed us some places including the uni, the beach (which is apparently a massive party place but the sea water is toxic), Mumbai's famous train station which was beautiful and nothing like the dive we had arrived into. We also saw the Gandhi museum. this was in a former residence of his and was fantastic! it was free entry and charted his life with pictures, correspondence to people including Hitler and Tolstoy and there was a room with different scenes depicting pinnacle points in his life, acted out by little dolls.

I
DSCF8714
went in not really knowing much about Gandhi, I knew he was famous as a peace maker and human rights activist but I didn’t realize how much of his life he spent campaigning for the poor, or how many countries he visited. The museum was an eye opener to say the least and we were that impressed we even made a donation! we also stopped to look over Mahalaxmi Dhobi Ghat- where they all do their washing. Particularly for the train that runs past (remember the 30 rupee sheets?) it is washing on an industrial scale! Everywhere are massive troughs (1026 to be precise) of washing being beaten and scrubbed, everywhere massive washing lines are hung with rows and rows of linen and clothing. I have seen it before on TV but is one of those moments that can never be properly experienced until you see it first hand.

when planning our day we had opted for a tour that included a visit to the slums, I hadn’t wanted to do this. I was worried about safety, however I knew that this was something you should really experience to put life into perspective. by this point I trusted Shaz
DSCF8715
completely and knew he would not let us endanger our safety. so agreed to go. We pulled over at the side of the road and went down a narrow street. All of us walked single file through a maze of houses and then back out again. All together we were in there about five minutes and that was really enough. We had actually visited a richer part of the slums. These were buildings where people lived and made pottery to sell in the market. We saw a potter at work on a potters wheel, his level of skill was incredible, each pot was identical and he sculpted it from a lump of clay in about four well practiced hand movements. Although we had not truly seen the slums (we were told it was too dangerous to go any further) it was still an eye-opener. Peoples lives are so intertwined and everything is done in the street. If I lived in that close proximity to neighbours back home i'm not convinced it would work the same way as here!

After we left we stopped on an overpass to look at where we had just been. It was a very smelly
DSCF8716
sea of blue tarpaulin and satellite dishes, it was horrifying to imagine living like that, however the irony is many second generation, educated, white collar individuals live there, having been raised in that environment and sticking to family and tradition. On leaving we were approached by a woman in a sari begging, only when she spoke she was certainly a man. On referring to the lonely planet guide book I discovered his tale is probably sad, being a 'Hijras' he was an outcast, socially frowned upon and quite possibly had had a traumatic life.

We were happy when the driver dropped us at the gateway of India and said his bit was finished. Primarily because his taste in music was dire (think very screechy woman meets Bollywood) but also partly because this was part of Mumbai that is actually beautiful! The gateway is massive and imposing and was built to commemorate king George v 1911 royal visit to India. It is also flanked by a Taj hotel which is a gorgeous, ornate building. We had planned on getting a boat over to Elephanta island but that proved difficult because of the crowds of people, the fact that the ticket
DSCF8717
sellers were just guys mingled in with the crowds and when I pulled out a wad of cash it turned out I had managed to only bring out 10 rupee notes (around 11p a note) this doesn't stretch very far (even in India) We borrowed money from Louise and hopped on a boat just as they decided it full, we squeezed in and stared in awe at the retreating gateway and then to naval ships, fishing boats, an expensive yacht and some freight ships. A few ships later and a fair distance from land we wondered where on earth we were going! It was taking ages and we were on a time limit. When we finally arrived we had to walk across 5 boats and up a jetty. To Plantys disappointment we had not come to see elephants, but rock temples!

Elephanta island takes its name from a stone elephant that used to sit in the port. However it is most famous for its rock temples, dedicated to lord Shiva. They are basalt caves carved into the rock with huge carvings of the god in different scenes adorning every wall and pillar. They are believed to have been created
DSCF8719
between AD 450 and 750 and although they are crumbling they remain impressive!

We made it to the base of the hill were there was a bar, from there was a steep climb along a narrow path with sellers on either side, whilst members of our group went the toilet we stood and ate some crisps whilst being midered by a very irritating goat! On setting off up the path a monkey ran across and jumped onto the wall beside, he sat aggressively screaming at us, everyone backed off and a local began motioning to a member of our group to give him her can of coke, we stared in disbelief as the guy took her coke and gave it to the monkey who proceeded to run up a tree with it and drink it. This put a member of our group off going any further and Planty gallantly offered to stay in the bar with her, I however made the sweaty journey up the hill to the temples. They were impressive, we have seen a fair few temples over the last couple of weeks and these were some of the most impressive. They are similar to the pyramids
DSCF8721
in the sense that you just stand and wonder how on earth people managed to create such impressive structures. On our way down another monkey ran at us as someone was carrying a bottle of sprite, he threw it and the monkey ran off with it triumphant. We couldn't wait to leave this island and its crazy junk food obsessed animals. Even the cows were pushy and they are normally the most placid of creatures! The sea was getting rougher as we departed and we kept getting drowned in spray! Although we were filthy, the sea was like the rest of Mumbai.. Dirty and we huddled together in the middle of the boat trying to avoid the murky cholera water! We rushed back to the hotel with under an hour to get ready, our taxi driver basically gave us a guided tour of Mumbai which we had already done that day. He also offered one of the lads drugs and then changed his price once we got to the hotel. When we finally got rid of him we grabbed our bags and dashed to our room. We were in 309, we walked up and down the corridor with all our
DSCF8722
luggage going from 308 to 310 round the corner wondering were our room was! Obviously it was the door with no number on that was different to all the others! Our room was actually impressive! Flat screen TV, rain shower (the water wasn't hot but we didn't even have a shower in ranakpur), it must have been refurbished recently. We quickly washed and met downstairs for dinner. We were going to Leopolds for dinner, a massive tourist trap it is known for its shady gangster past, 3L beer and being a target in the 2008 terror attacks on Mumbai. Behind where we sat was bullet holes in the wall serving as a constant reminder of the tragedy. Furthermore the guy with the massive gun on the door prevents it from happening again! Leopolds also served beef – the first I had seen in India, I had a steak burger and in true Indian style it was really spicy! This is after all a country where they eat curry for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

From there we went to the gateway of India to see it all lit up at night. All the way there and for most of the
DSCF8723
way back we were followed by Mafia owned begging street kids, one even had a money tin, I also got the impression they were not above a little pickpocketing either! After many no's and a couple of go aways, even a torrent of profanities from Planty they still persisted, it wasn't until a policeman shouted at them they left.

The next morning we decided to brave the streets of Mumbai over the hotel “restaurant” for breakfast. However this turned out to be no easy feat, the safety of a McDonald’s was too far so we set off looking for an alternative. We saw the others in a coffee shop and they warned us not to eat anything with cheese in... which was everything, so we tried a bakery, they only sold cake, the previous night I had a dessert called “chocolate ecstasy” it was amazing and the bakery sold them, we purchased two thinking it would be a substantial breakfast item! Over the road was “wrap express” probably a little more wholesome than a calorific sugar overhaul we headed over to it. We never saw the wraps so cannot comment, however I can comment on the express bit, it
DSCF8724
was a lie! We stood for 10 minutes watching them mess with a gas cylinder, we knew they hadn’t started our wraps yet and had to get back to the hotel so said we would just buy our drinks and leave. That in itself took another 10 minutes and included questions such as “what is your mobile number?” ...not a chance!

We scoffed our chocolate and set off for Mumbai airport. In the taxi the driver asked if we liked music. I recalled the horror we listened to the previous day but before I could protest we were blasting out Indian dance music. He was a funny one, I could see him looking back at us in his rear-view mirror and laughing at our horror every time he had a near miss of slammed on, especially when another taxi nearly crashed trying to overtake... that was apparently hilarious! When you get stuck in traffic in Mumbai beggars come up to the car, we had people trying to sell us books, souvenirs and there was a girl, no older then 14 carrying a baby with a really bad skin condition asking for money. It was horrific! We were told by
DSCF8725
our guide that she could very easily be treated in a hospital, however the girls were gang owned and she could earn more money in that condition. It was heartbreaking!

We checked in our luggage and passed through security unhindered except for the shopperholic ladies (Planty will give his opinio of them shortly) who had taped up a hammock they had been carrying round since Delhi so it looked suspicious and got scanned as a potential weapon! On the other side of security was a KFC! After an unsuccessful mornings forage us westerners where at it like moths to a flame! I was had by the “upgrade your drink for only 10 rupees” ad, it looked like green slush, I should have noted Plantys new rule of never order anything green as it turned out to be a sort of salty mango jelly concoction, yum! I even attempted to palm it off on someone else but to no avail. The best was Shaz though, he had to ask someone what to order as he had never had KFC before, bless!

The flight was pretty uneventful and Goa airport was a dump! We were welcomed by a cloudy sky
DSCF8726
(not conforming to our 2 day beach plan) and a sign saying merry Christmas. There were also plastic figures of Hindu gods and a half naked Gandhi everywhere, making me double take constantly.

We got in a taxi with an orange Ganesh and two plastic crocodiles on the dashboard. We asked the driver what the recent weather had been like, optimistic this was a brief hiccup..... “rain” was our only response. Failing conversation we turned our attention to the radio. This was our first indication we were in an area of India we were unfamiliar with. The radio elsewhere had been quite traditional Indian music, some drivers had been partial to some Indian dance/trance but Goa radio was the worst! It was a combination of annoying jingles and hits ranging from “the locomotion” to “call me maybe”. Furthermore these were interspersed by really dramatic adverts about how if you tremor you should film yourself and take it to the local hospital for analysis, and ensure you don’t have any standing water as it breeds mosquitoes from the national vector programme, it was just weird!

More bemused and a little traumatised by the radio we began looking out of
DSCF8727
our windows and absorbing the scenery. I went from not wanting to look because of the threatening grey sky to being mesmerised by how lush and tropical Goa appeared, in addition the damp air gave it a misty, sleepy feel, like the inhabitants were waking up to a new day (although the day was nearly over). It was a sharp contrast to the dust of Pushkar and the pollution of Mumbai, even the main roads were meandering rural lanes and despite the grim sky I really felt on holiday. We arrived at our destination, the “alor resort” was not much of a resort, we were shown to our room which was obviously back out the hotel, past a gaggling congregation of locals and through a rusty gate next to someone’s washing. Our apartment was huge, four bed for the two of us, but I wouldn’t count that as praise. I’m still trying to work out which was worse, this or Delhi, oh and you had to walk through the shower to get to the toilet again.....

Again we had very little time to get ready for dinner, we rushed down to find most of our group sat drinking beer,
DSCF8728
at £1 for a large bottle most had decided they like Goa already! The cheap beer continued in the restaurant. In Goa the trend is to bring out the fresh catch of the day so you can pick something that takes your fancy, I decided that as we were in Goa I would be adventurous and go for a stuffed masala crab with a side salad. The salad was amazing, I'd been craving one for weeks and the crab was far too much hard work for very little food. It started raining whilst we were in the restaurant, only it doesn’t rain in Goa it pours! I’ve never seen anything like it! After eating and when the rain had eased slightly we waded to a bar. It was buy one get one free on beer making it 40p a bottle, the same applied for some of the spirits which were by far not small measures. Goa was so weird, we had become used to dressing conservatively so I had put on a maxi dress but all the local girls were in hot pants and mini dresses, we had literally gone from one extreme to another! Shaz had also warned us
DSCF8731
about them saying they have a few drinks and go mental! I was watching one in the bar toying with two young men and no sooner had I mentioned it she turned her attention to the locals playing pool with Rick and Planty. Shaz was over in a flash warning us about her but she soon moved on. The whole thing was so strange. Indian women are not like that! They are conservative and demur, not absolute tarts and it was sad to see the majority behaving like that. Conveniently at half time in the Liverpool match it was time to leave. We also had an early start, with a breakfast meeting planned for 8am.

Breakfast we pushed the boundaries and had a fry up style breakfast. OK the bacon was streaky and crispy and I couldn't even tell you what animal the sausage came from, but there was not even an essence of masala or chilli so it was good! From there the plan was to go to old Goa and then to a spice farm to see the elephants. We got to a church in old Goa, had a look round and then went to go further.
DSCF8734
We could feel a change in the wind ""oh it feels like it could rain"" said Planty, and then it did! We ran for cover but it took us around 30 seconds to get drenched through. We made it back to our taxi and told him we'd seen enough of old Goa and to go to the spice farm. It was the same driver with his orange Ganesh, surly attitude and Goa FM. He didn't even flinch when four soggy westerners bundled into his taxi and told him to basically skip all of Goa's history and culture and find the elephants. He just obediently drove. When we arrived at the spice farm the weather was beginning to ease. After a cup of hot lemon grass tea we were shown around the plantation. This was a collection of all the different herbs, spices and fruit the Indians harvest. Unfortunately I didn't pay much attention as the humid wet weather had brought the mosquitoes out to play. Possibly the most memorable quote of the whole trip came from the guide at this point:

""oh these mosquitoes are OK, they are organic mosquitoes so don't have malaria""

How is that
DSCF8735
supposed to reassure me?? An insect the size of a bee is stealing my blood but its ok, because it won't give me malaria. The huge big itchy lumps I had for days all over the backs of my knees weren’t a problem whatsoever! Furthermore it is tradition that after leaving the plantation they wash with lemon grass in the stream. The tourist alternative is to have it poured down your back. Already wet and a little cold with itches all over from imaginary mosquitoes... I was not impressed! After the tour was a buffet. It was quite a good spread considering our rustic surroundings. It was quite spicy, but then we were on a spice farm! We were also given a shot of Fenny, the local coconut spirit to try. It was rancid! We picked bananas straight from the stem which were the tastiest bananas ever, by this point we were feeling a little stung that we hadn't seen any elephants, that was after all what we came for! We asked at reception and they told us we had to get our driver to take us round the back of the farm, we did and pulled up at the
DSCF8737
dodgiest looking set up. There were three elephants stood half asleep. The big male had his tusks tipped to remove the sharp ends. The other two, a female and a juvenile were next to him, all had a chain around one foot but freedom to move. There was a price list to one side with bathe, ride or feed and that was pretty much it! We went for bathe then followed the elephant and its trainer through someone’s back garden and into the spice farm.

She settled in some murky water and we were given coconut shells and told to go in and scratch her with them. She lay on her side with her head fully submerged and only the end of her trunk showing. We scrubbed her back, her head and then down her trunk. The trainer got us to put our hands over her trunk whilst she blew air. It is so powerful! She had the most beautiful intelligent eyes with massive dark eyelashes. I fell in love with her immediately! We gave her some space whilst she sat up and then were told to climb up her back leg and sit on her back. I felt
DSCF8739
a little nervous at first, she was so huge! But she was also really laid back! We sat there whilst here trainer shouted to her to spray us with water. We got absolutely drenched through. She was also able to predict him, filling her trunk before she was asked. When we got down it was Rick and Amanda turn and then we left. As we dried off she stood up and started grazing the trees and spraying water on herself. The trainer was helping her wash and scratching her face, they obviously had a very strong bond which was reassuring to see. It had been by far the best experience with a wild animal I have ever had. It was natural and she got as much enjoyment from the interaction as we did. I would go as far as to say it was my highlight so far.

After a well needed shower we were out again this time we were having a look at the beach. The weather had managed to clear up but down at the beach it became evident it was going to rain again. The beach was absolutely full of locals. It looked like the prime
DSCF8744
meeting point. It was like a where's wally for tourists, in fact all the beach sellers made a beeline for us!

It had began to rain and we had spotted some of our group sat in one of the beach bars, we quickly joined them and ordered a beer off the waiter who clearly wasn't on this planet. We began taking in our surroundings, Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix posters adorned the wall, the ""DJ"" was playing every song by Pittbull ever made... Repeatedly and it was frequented by young Indian men. If we had any doubts as to the not so hidden agenda of the bar, these were quickly forgotten when the shifty eyed waiter offered Rick a shisha and then feigned offense when he asked for no drugs. Since Planty was out of clean clothes and the ones we had sent to be laundered wouldn't be returned until the next morning I offered to go and buy him a top for the evening. This was met with much enthusiasm by the other girls and we made a swift exit. We didn't have much time to browse as we had evening plans and I quickly chose a striped
DSCF8746
polo t-shirt for £2.50. We estimated how long it would take the boys to finish their beers and timed it just right so we didn't have to sit back down. I was greeted by an excited Planty ""the man with the BBQ has a baby shark can you take a picture of me with it please"" he proclaimed in one breath, I tried to argue the ethics of taking an animal out of the gene pool before it has chance to breed, but before I knew it I was stood taking a picture of him with a dead shark and then listened to him moan about how his hands stunk of fish all the way home and tried to get everyone to smell them! After the quickest change known to (wo)man we were out for our final group dinner. I couldn't believe that was our last one. However we definitely went out with a bang! They brought out the fresh catch and we didn't pay much attention to it. Planty typically opted for the most expensive thing on the menu, I chose a kingfish steak on the basis that I don't eat fish very much but being in Goa I
DSCF8748
should and I know I like tuna and swordfish steaks. Mine was nice, but Plantys was amazing! On the recommendation of the waiter he had abandoned his fish and prawn concoction and gone for the tandoori red snapper, part of the fresh catch. I'm sure he will fill you in on the details, however I must say I helped him eat it! I had some amazing chocolate creation for dessert. During the meal we had passed round an envelope to give Shaz a parting gift. He went out for a cigarette and we all followed. Planty being the master of spouting rubbish spontaneously gave a speech about how wonderful Shaz had been that had people in tears. I was very proud!

After a farewell drink, Planty who had over indulged slightly needed to go back to the hotel. We got a taxi which proved to be the slowest journey ever. It seems Friday night is party night in Goa and everywhere was packed. It was a relief to return to our less than pleasant hotel!

The plan for the next day was to check out hire mopeds to check out the other beaches north Goa has to offer.
DSCF8749
Mopeds are the mode of transport in Goa, and in India over the last two weeks we had many feats involving mopeds carrying different things including whole Indian families including mother holding tiny baby, goats, chickens and panes of glass. Also we had seen school kids zipping around on them... How hard could it be? We paid our £2.50 for a days hire and set off. Our first incident occurred when we were going down a dirt track. I felt Planty tense and his legs went out to stop, I think he misjudged how to turn. This shook me and the next turn I completely panicked making him have to slam on again, he shouted at me and when we met up with the others at breakfast, both times were my fault! I sulked for most of breakfast, partly because I could not stop shaking and I had been portrayed as a wimp and partly because it had begun to rain.. HARD. There was no way I was getting back on that thing in the rain. We toyed with our options, go shopping (my suggestion) go to the beach anyway because were only going to get wet (Plantys) and the
DSCF8752
one that eventually won- take the moped back and just go to our next place. We said goodbye to our group, perhaps not as emotional as it could have been as I was preoccupied about getting back on the death-trap, I don't think either of us enjoyed the journey back to the hotel and its safe to say mopeds were not my favourite mode of transport whilst in India, but we tried it! We managed to leave the hotel pretty much straight away, we were reliant on Shaz one last time to sort our taxi and we parted with him telling us if we need anything whilst in India or if we ever return to not hesitate to call, but soon after the realisation that we were once again on our own hit us. Its not that we don't enjoy each others company, its just a lot more daunting when there is two of you. We had become so dependant on Shaz and there is no way we could have done India without him, well we could but I would have been a nervous wreck by the end of it! It was so good to just immerse ourselves in India
DSCF8754
and not have to worry about the logistics. Being alone I was back playing the responsible one and I had enjoyed not having to. About hour and a half later we reached our second hotel. We had debated whether to keep our booking for the south Goan hotel as we only had one night there and were leaving early next morning. We had been told it was hours away and we had really concluded it wasn't worth it! However it wasn't that far, if we hadn't had the worlds slowest taxi driver and got lost the journey would have been minimal, however it felt like we were in a completely different country! The hotel was beautiful! There was complimentary drinks, toiletries and you could see all the way to the bottom of the pool! The bathroom had a separate shower cubical and you didn't have to walk through it to get to the toilet! We dragged ourselves out of our luxurious room and down a palm tree lined path to the beach. The long white sandy beach was desolate. There were lifeguards and a few local fishermen but you could lie here forever. The sun was shining and the stark
DSCF8756
contrast to north Goa was overwhelming. We relished the peace and quiet and just strolled up the beach, enjoying the moment. The only hassle we encountered were a couple of older ladies who were selling jewellery but seemed a little more interested in us then anything. Everyone seemed friendly here. The life guards said hi as you walk past, people stared but it was with curiosity whereas in north Goa it had felt slimy and intimidating. We stopped at a beach bar, the menu stated the salad was washed with mineral water so I had a Caesar salad, Planty was on the beer but my new favourite drink was fresh lime soda, basically for 40p you get a lime and soda made with fresh lime not cordial, massively refreshing sat in the sun! Every fruit juice is made fresh in India. You order pineapple juice, its a pineapple in a blender, watermelon juice, orange and so on! All for the price of a beer which is cheap anyway! We sat in the bar, looking out onto the beach talking about how much the rest of our group would love it. It was so strange, 15 days ago we had met
DSCF8758
as complete strangers but now it was strange to be apart. We had spent every waking moment with them and it was strangely quiet, and come to think of it conversation was abnormally tame! Walking back we met a bouncy mongrel who evidently wanted to play, she play bowed and wagged and barked then ran off into the sea and back again, the game quickly became Planty kicking water at her and her running off into the sea and then back for more. Soon she stopped and watched us as we continued to walk. It must have been a territory line. Its been hard not touching the dogs here, we are both so soft over them, and she was the worst. we just wanted to take her home! Back at the hotel there was time for a quick dip in the pool before dinner. Dinner was again good food but I think Plantys red snapper was still to fresh in his mind for him to properly enjoy it!

When my alarm went off at 4.30 the next morning I thought it was a joke! Instead of going back to sleep I sat and thought about why it was going
DSCF8759
off at that time, which was lucky because we were catching a flight to Chennai that morning! Our hotel arranged a taxi and we made it to the airport in around 30 mins. We were flying air India, our flight to Goa had been with spice jet so we had slightly higher expectations for air India, even the terminal put a stop to that! It wouldn't have looked out of place in a museum, ""exhibit a is a replica of the first passenger airport, as you can see nothing was electronic, even the numbers on the check-in desks had to be changed by hand""... You get the idea! The plane was carpeted and patterned with an orange-brown- red design and we were sat behind the worlds worst group of idiots! I remember on one of the flights browsing the in-flight magazine and reading an article about the 10 worst ways to irritate your fellow passengers, these ticked all the boxes! They asked for extra food after it had been brought round, midered the flight attendants for coffee and their seats were back from the moment the cabin crew had finished making their take off checks until even after we landed.
DSCF8766
Putting the seat back irritates me, I can't help it. If they ask politely I can tolerate, however if they just throw it back, put their hands above their head and get in my personal space I get annoyed, especially when you have leg room fit for a toddler! He didn't even get the hint of a few well placed kicks, or the fact that we were not quiet in our criticisms of him, when the one in front of Planty followed suit I thought Planty might burst! Finally when we had landed he did, as I was trying to grab our belongings from the floor, he proceeded to dramatically throw his chair back and then push it when he found it wouldn't go any further because it was meeting my head! He seemed surprised when Planty objected to his girlfriend having a seat bashed across her head... We both stared disapprovingly as we left the aircraft!

we decided on another prepaid government taxi service from the airport and for £3.50 you can't really complain. We paid and them were quickly ushered towards a taxi, it was the same black and yellow monstrosity from Delhi... Come back to haunt
DSCF8771
us! However this one didn't smell of goat, it just had a lovely brown floral pattern on the floor, ceiling, doors, seats... Every surface in the cab in fact was floral! From the rear-view mirror hung an elaborate mix of tassels and key rings with Ganesh on them and a display of dead flowers and more statues of the elephant god covered his dashboard. The guy who's job it was to allocate taxis pestered for a tip, we refused saying we had no money, because we found him rude bur then ensured we tipped our taxi driver double (the look on his face said he knew our game) our arrival at the hotel was bizarre. We had booked five star because it was cheap and I thought it would be good to go from Dubai to basic backpacker accommodation to luxury, and ok I may have been sold by the pretty staircase in the pictures, but I wasn't expecting this! Before our taxi entered the premises a guard had a metal detector in the boot. We walked in the doors through the metal detector and were greeted by marble and chandeliers and good morning sir, madam. We had bottles of
DSCF8777
water and cold towels handed to us, in the meantime all I could think of was what do we and our grubby rucksacks look like after 2 weeks of India! We got to our room and to be honest we saw as much of Chennai as we did of Delhi! We did some sleeping, some blogging and skyping and ate lots! For our evening dinner we got dressed up and went to the rooftop restaurant. Here we had a waiter/ manservant who's name began with k, but that's all I remember. We were seated overlooking Chennai, I was slightly disappointed with Chennai if i'm honest, being the business centre and full of swanky hotels I expected more. The impression I've created of India is that the little towns each have their own unique charm, whereas the big cities are a segregated into the mega rich and those struggling to survive!

Anyway our meal was definitely a fitting goodbye to India, just when you think you're safe and nothing completely bizarre can happen, it does! Our waiter drove me mental, he needed permission from us to breathe! I know he must have been trained in that manner but seriously! He
DSCF8782
brought drinks over “can I open it” we finished a drink “can I clear” the same applied to when we finished eating, we asked for the bill “shall I get you the bill sir” he was exhausting! Also if you had a sip of water he was straight over pouring more into your glass, he just hovered for the whole meal! We ordered starters and mains, what we should have ordered was just a main and noodles or rice! Both the starter and main were exactly the same size and consistency, just different meats and sauces and my starter came with Plantys main and the waiter was spooning bits of it onto our plates, insisting we share dishes. Planty had prawns and mushrooms, two things I hate! Afterwards we went into the hotel bar and had a beer. This was the first place I had seen kingfisher on draft. These too gave us more snacks. They will literally have to roll me through customs if I eat any more. My plan for India was to get ill and lose loads of weight, in fact I had begun to believe it inevitable, everyone gets the dreaded “Delhi belly” don’t they? No
DSCF8921
is the answer, I ate so well in India and I’ve gained weight which was really surprising.

The next morning we waved goodbye to this amazing country. Our hotel said bye with a complimentary box of south Indian sweets (an acquired taste). We had tried to book a taxi again but failed, i'm sure Planty will go into the colourful detail so ended up travelling to the airport in a hotel car with “accord metropolitan” splashed up the side. We definitely began our trip to Sri Lanka in style, the rest of the journey is a whole new entry!



Shaz's favourite motto was “embrace the bizarre” and with India I certainly felt we embraced, squeezed and extracted every ounce of bizarre they had to offer! Every new town was a different level of strange and no two days were even remotely the same. India took us out of our comfort zones and really showed what we are capable of. I don't ever think my comfort zone will shrink back to what it was and I think I’ve learnt a lot about valuing experiences over possessions. I've really struggled to describe India, its one of those places
DSCF8924
where you cannot put into words what is happening to all your senses and many of the sights have to be seen to be believed. It is truly unique, like nowhere else!

My highlights were the elephant bathe, the tranquillity of Belbatim beach (South Goa) and the crazy day of the Ganesh festival in Udaipur when I felt we really did embrace the bizarre!







Plantys version: (Family i apologise for his colourful language!) Inside the station at Falna I was bursting for the toilet, and our guide showed us to the 'high class toilets', but like everything in India that is considered high class, you mustn’t expect a solid gold toilet, or a toilet at all in this case. The toilet was a choice of either 2 cubicles that had holes in the floor or a very smelly and unclean urinal. I opted for the urinal but had to hold my t-shirt over my nose due to repulsive smell from my surroundings, I would have much rather licked a sumo wrestlers arse crack than have to deal with the smell from that toilet again. Once I'd survived my ordeal of a high
DSCF8925
class toilet, we stocked up on crisps and biscuits, and headed across to our platform to wait for the train, all the while having every other passenger listen in curiously as our guide told us what to do when the train arrives, which carriage we where on and our seat numbers. A few of us had seat numbers that were on their own but our guide told us not to worry, just sit in them, and he would sort it out. After a few anxious minutes the train arrived, and with our backpacks strapped to our backs, we ran down the platform to the carriage, I waited and made sure all the girls where on before I climbed aboard (because I'm a true gentleman), but the train had barely stopped for a minute, and began to set off again, while I was part on the platform, part on the train.



We walked down the train to our seats, and observed our surroundings for what would be our new hotel for the night. As you walk down the carriage, there are bunk bed style things on the right hand side, lining the train all the way, while in
DSCF8927
the opposite side, there are bunk beds situated back to back all the way down the train, with a back rest that folds out to be the middle bed, sleeping 6 in each bay. I happened to get an aisle bed, while one of the girls ended up with 5 Indian lads, but our guide told us to stay in our seats, and give him 5 minutes. By now I knew we could trust our guide, every place we went he had so much attention, as we walked through the streets of various places, people shook his hand, and everywhere we ate, we discounted beer. He had a high level of respect from the locals, but then again, he's taking 14 westerners through India, so the more people keep him sweet, the more chance there is of us using their hotel/restaurant/tuk tuk etc. What our guide did for the next few minutes was ask people who weren't part of our group, but were sat with them, to move to accommodate for someone on their own, so we could all be sat together in one big group. People politely agreed without hesitation, they were more than happy to be of assistance,
DSCF8929
either that or they didn't want to be in the middle of the crude conversations that would get worse as the night progressed. Finally everyone was sorted, with me being moved into a bay with Lotty, Amanda and Rick (the Aussie couple), Greg, and Louise (Lotty's favourite person of the trip). As the train set off, the lads took it in turns to play 'what would you rather?' were they give the option of 2 disgusting choices, and you pick which one you would rather do, and as you can probably guess, it got more foul, more disgusting and very crude very quickly.



The hours rolled on, and people started to drift off to sleep while our bay was still in full flow of conversation, it was getting on for about 11pm, so we folded out our make shift shelves and settled down for the night. Me and Lotty had the privilege of sleeping on the fold out shelves, while the 2 girls slept on the bottom, and the other 2 lads, who were quite tall, had the top ones. As we didn't have pillows, and Lotty had bought some sort of sleeping bag liner for us
DSCF8930
to sleep in, we stuffed the part where a pillow goes, with shorts, socks, t-shirts and so on, which was fine, until you wake up at 3am with belt buckle sticking into the side of your head.



I kept waking up every few hours, after making sure our bags where still there, I drifted off again, apart from the time I was woken by some Idiots alarm, that got loader and loader as he tried to find the phone. He soon managed to find it when I shouted him to “TURN THAT F*****G ALARM OFF!!!!”, to which our guide gave him a bit of a telling off in Hindi too. 7Am arrived, and whether I liked it or not, I was to be kept awake by the sounded of 2 guys walking up and down the carriage offering masala chai and potato omelettes, in the most annoying, high pitched, screechy, put on voice in the world. Everytime they walked past, they received a collective 'no' from our bay, as they drifted down the carriage, Luke (a Scottish lad on our group, who had a great sense of humour) was coming back from the toilet when he mimicked
DSCF8931
the guys selling food, by offering 'Bacon butties, Sausage supper', which pretty much sent the entire group into fits of laughter, its was probably one of those 'you had to be there' moments, but I was still giggling about it hours later.



Safely off the train, we got a bunch of taxi's to the hotel, not before our driver decided to stop for his breakfast around the corner, leaving us all sweating our arse's off in the taxi wanting to gently remove every extremity from his body. After a journey that felt like 5 hours, we arrived, soaked with sweat, at our hotel, Mumbai was very muggy and sweaty, although there was a bit of cloud cover. We grabbed some breakfast and then received a bit of crap news. After our overnight train ride, and sweaty taxi journey, all I wanted to do was have a shower, but our rooms weren’t ready yet. There was only one room ready, so 14 of us piled our bags in there and tried to freshen up, to save time and avoid making people wait, me Lotty and Louise shared the bathroom to do our teeth, being as quick as we
DSCF8933
could when one of the older women on our group stood in the door way asking if we had finished yet. The 3 of us stood there, toothbrushes in mouths, with toothpaste halfway down our cheeks and gave her a vacant stare. Yes obviously we had finished in the bathroom, that's why we proceeded to stand in there brushing our teeth you absolute moron (I didn't speak to her or her friend much, because I had sod all to say to either of them, and they are both horrendously rude).



After our pitstop freshen up and change, we had a driver that gave us a tour of Mumbai, we stopped at Bombay University, which looks amazing from the outside. We couldn't go inside, but the gardens, the architecture and just the feel of the place looks fantastic, from there, we stopped at various pointless places until we got to the Gandhi museum, where we met up with another part of the group. I don't mean to sound a bit dense, but I didn't really know much about Gandhi, apart from he used to walk around everywhere semi-naked and with a smile that would make anyone thing he
DSCF8934
was high on drugs. The museum documented his fight for human rights, and the struggles he faced in the process, his struggles with illness and death. Some of the information and the things that he said were really interesting, there was one quote that he said that I liked so much, I'm contemplating getting it tattooed on me, which I'm sure will delight my mother.



From there we asked to be taken to the slums of Mumbai, which are the biggest in Asia. Mumbai has a population of around 20 million, and 55% of that lives in the slums, it's essentially a city within a city. Our drivers took us to the outskirts of the slums and gave us a quick tour, and I've gotta say, the living conditions are pretty grim, I knew that the further in you go, the worse it gets, but the outskirts were enough. It really makes you appreciate what you have back home when you see places like this. People who moan that they don't have Sky tv, or wi-fi, or they don't have the latest I-phone should take a trip down there. When we asked why we weren’t taken deeper
DSCF8937
into the slums, our drivers told us that it's not safe for westerners, and the further in you go, the higher the danger. We stopped at a bridge overlooking another part of the slums, when a local ladyboy approached us asking for money, I was confused at first as to what this creature before me was, it was definitely part man, with its hairy arms and Adams apple, but wearing a dress and make up? Very bizarre indeed.



So, slum tour over, we headed to the gateway of India to get a boat over to Elephanta island, and I was quite disappointed when I found out there are no elephants on there. While we waited for our tickets, a local with his camera asked if his friend could have a picture with one of the girls, she declined, but he took the picture anyway. Not wanting to cause a scene, the girl ignored him when he took another one, I decided to step in and remind the lad that she'd said no, and told him to get lost. The same lad then asked for my picture, practically begging me, I again said no, before he claimed that
DSCF8940
he knew who I was and that I'm famous. I was confused too, but after it felt like I was getting nowhere with the clown, I raised my voice slightly, and told him where to go. As we waited for the boat the same lad casually walked over and hurled some abuse at me in Hindi, to which I responded that I don't have a clue what he's saying, nor do I care, and for what felt like the tenth time, asked him politely to sod off.



Shortly after, some of the other group turned up and we headed to the island on the same boat, our guide had told us it takes about 45 minutes to get there, but he was wrong, it was more like 1 hour 45 minutes. Eventually at the Island, we followed the crowds to the bottom of the hill, passing dogs, goats, cows, chickens and monkeys on the way. I should have mentioned what elephant island is, it's an island with some hand carved temples, that's about it. One of the girls got freaked out by one of the monkeys who was screeching and trying to steal things off people, as
DSCF8941
she decided she didn't want to go, I said I'd stay back with her to keep her company, what I really meant, was I'd stay back with her and drink beer. We sat drinking beer, nice and relaxed in a air conditioned bar and waited for the others to come back, and they did a while later, covered in sweat and looking severely exhausted. Not for the first time on this trip, I think I made the right decision in sitting in a bar having a beer.



Back on the boat and heading for the mainland, the sea was ever so slightly choppy, and we all got drenched, although after the day we'd had, with no shower after the overnight train, a sweaty taxi ride and a tour of Mumbai, things couldn't get any worse. Back in Mumbai we got a couple of taxi's back to the hotel, and our driver decided to give Luke a lesson on how to drive in Mumbai and a guided tour of the city and discription of what we where passing on the roads, I was trying not to laugh when Luke pointed at a horse at the side of the
DSCF8944
road and sarcastically stated “that’s a horse” basically humouring the driver. Back at the hotel, we had a quick argument with the driver who tried to charge us more than we agreed, but he certainly wasn't going to win an argument with a lad from Glasgow.



Finally, we had the chance to have a shower, and it felt so good, like I said before, Mumbai is a very sweaty place, so it was good to get clean as we headed out for dinner, to a very famous place that made world news in 2008. The tragic terrorist attacks that took place in Mumbai in 2008 targeted a place called Leopold's, which has been famous with tourists and backpackers since it opened in 1876. The terrorists had struck at the Taj Hotel not far from away when they ran to the restaurant, threw a grenade in and opened fire on the customers and staff, so as you can imagine, I was rather nervous on the walk down there. The restaurant now has armed guards on each door, checking peoples bags as they enter, our table was over near the back wall and as we sat down, the extent
DSCF8945
of the attacks was still plain to see. 2 of the people on our table sat at the same place where shots had been fired into the wall, as they looked behind them, the bullet holes still remained in the wall. This was a frightful reminder of what had taken place that night.



The food in the restaurant was really good, like the majority of Indian foods, but the 3 litre towers of beer seemed more appealing, although they ruined it by filling them with carslberg. I don't want to sound like a snob, but I'd rather drink sea water that has been poured directly into my mouth from between Noel Edmunds unwashed toes than drink carlsberg, its just so bland and disgusting, never the less, we had beer to drink, and drink it we did, although I didn't enjoy it too much. After the meal we wanted to check out the bar upstairs, just for a quick look around, as was always the case with Leopold's, it was heaving, but as we turned to leave, I noticed yet another reminder of the attacks in 2008. 2 of the windows had been shot at, but they had
DSCF8946
not been replaced, the bullet holes and the shattered glass still remain in place, I felt an overwhelming shudder up my spine as we walked out, knowing that innocent people had suffered in this place.



Heading back to the hotel we got caught up in a monsoon, which wasn't the nicest thing to be caught up in. The heavens opened and within 30 seconds we were all drenched, it was pointless running for cover or getting taxi's because we really couldn't get any wetter, so we plodded on with our shoes squelching out the rain water and my hair product seeping down my face and into my eyes, just what I always wanted out of a holiday.



We left Mumbai the next morning bound for the airport to catch a flight to Goa. Although our visit to Mumbai was very brief, we were all happy to leave, everyone agreed that in general, Mumbai was a massive shit hole, I'd rather go swimming in the artic circle in a pair of speedo's than go back to Mumbai. We got into a taxi and headed for the airport, what seemed to be a common factor about
DSCF8948
our local drivers, is they are all bonkers, ours must have been about 65/70 years old and asked if we liked music, we reluctantly said yes, thinking it was going to be old school bollywood that he played, but it was modern dance music. We hurtled towards the airport with the music blasting, and everyone else on the roads thinking we were absolute lunatics, but it was our driver, he was crazy.



The airport was only a small one as it only catered for domestic flights, so we pretty much checked in, went through security and grabbed some lunch. Staying true to the stereotypical view of westerners, we all grabbed a KFC and scoffed it down as if it was our last supper. We didn't really do much else in the airport, well I bought a book, but that was really it. A while later we boarded our plane, and I'm not joking here, but we flew with 'Spice Airways', I thought it was a joke, but its actually an airline. The flight was quite short, about an hour I think, we also found out that a famous bollywood star was on board, but no one seemed
DSCF8949
to care. We landed a short time later to be greeted by a dull, cloudy Goa. After getting our bags, we headed outside to be greeted by our already waiting taxi's, and then it started to rain......great. We'd all been looking forward to Goa, a chance to unwind on the beach and really chill out, but I was starting to realise that this wasn't going to be the case.



We arrived after an hour drive through the tropical climate of Goa and arrived at our hotel and checked in. We were shown to our room which was out of the hotel, up a side street and up some dodgy looking stair case to our room. As was becoming common, we unpacked, showered, got changed and met up in the reception to go out for dinner. At the restaurant, we discovered that beer was even cheaper than previous places, so we started gulping away, deciding what to eat. I, being all macho, opted for a prawn vindaloo, partly because I'm stupid, but partly because I'm adventurous. We waited a while for our food, but I don't mind waiting for food, when it's good, but before our food came,
1271373996341 2064765532 n
I could feel some sort of regret about my choice of curries, I was beginning to think that I wouldn't be able to finish a vindaloo and would go hungry for the rest of the night, and the next morning my delicate bottom wouldn't be able to cope with pain of getting rid of a vindaloo. The food eventually arrived and I was highly surprised, a curry that is known in the UK for being nothing more than an extremely hot fireball burning its way through your digestive system, while removing multiple layers of skin from the inside of your mouth, was the tastiest dish I had tried so far on my travels. I sat there speechless at how delicious it was, there were so many flavours all working together to give you the ultimate taste in curry. I had to let the others try it, and they all agreed, that it was the nicest tasting curry they had tried, I was so happy with my choice. I cleared my entire plate wanting more. During our meal, the resort was hit by a monsoon, and the restaurant had slight gaps in the ceiling, as we where getting trickles of rain
23938 10151265780116341 1530388921 n
running down our backs we had to constantly move our tables out of the way. The street outside the restaurant was now a full flowing river, we waited for the rain to stop as we paid our bills, with our bellies full and ready for a few drinks at a local bar.



After a short walk we reached the bar and already had a long table set up for us, while the bar staff came over with free shots for us (which were the size of a triple shot back in the UK) we were informed that 330ml bottles of kingfisher were on offer at 2-4-1, what made it better was they worked out at 40p per bottle. The night wore on, and the alcohol consumption grew higher, eventually we all headed back to the hotel. When we got back I attempted to Skype my parents, I can't remember what the hell I was talking to them about because I was pretty hammered, I could have been telling them anything for all I know.



Feeling no exactly fresh, I was rudely awoken by Lotty telling me politely to remove myself from the bed, as
47567 10151265772861341 920188106 n
it was time to get up, due to the amount of beer I had consumed hours earlier, this was a difficult task for me to deal with. We all headed to a local restaurant for some breakfast, which I was hoping would sort me out, then headed off on a small tour of Goa, 4 of us in a car with a driver. Me and Lotty set off with the Aussie couple, first stop was to be north Goa, basically to see some old churches. Still not feeling too good, we reached our first destination with me walking around like a half eaten caterpillar, struggling to find enthusiasm as we wandered aimlessly around the church, all the while noticing that the weather didn't look too pleasant. As we made our way to the second church, a gust of wind swept past us, I knew the weather was about to make a turn for the worse. About 2 minutes later, the heavens opened, not like the typical British rain, this was tropical monsoon rain, and as was the same in Mumbai, and the previous night in Goa, we looked like rats that had been submerged in a swimming pool as we
47911 10151265776471341 920951139 n
desperately ran to find shelter. We reached the same spot that we had been dropped off at by our driver but couldn't find him, we basically wanted to get the hell out of the area quickly!



As the others stood in the shelter, I (in my severely hungover and unimpressed state) decided to have a quick run further down the road to see if our driver had parked up, although I didn't even know what car he was driving. Just before I had decided that I'd had enough showers for the day, and headed back to the others, a parked car began beeping his horn and flashing his lights, being confused, I thought it was some local nutter who wanted to lure me into his car with the promise of sweets and chocolate. Turns out it was our driver, as I found out soon after when he swiftly came to our rescue as we rung our clothes dry at the side of the road.



Thankfully out of the rain and into our car, we opted to head to the next port of call for the day, the spice farms, to which we had read
61405 10151265816951341 509453776 n
that they have elephants that you can wash and feed. Arriving at the spice farms, the rain had started to subside, and we made our way inside to wait for our tour of the farms. I won't bore you with a lot of details (I know Lotty loves to do that), but our tour consisted of us being shown how various spices such as cinnamon, cloves, curry leaves and so on, are grown, the foods they are used in, and any medicinal purposes they hold.



Tour over, it was time for lunch, hopefully this would sort my stomach out a bit, as I still wasn't feeling 100%. As we waited for the buffet to be prepared, we were all given a free 'shot' of Fenny (local spirit), I say shot, it was basically a double shot, not what I needed in my hungover state. I didn't drink it all, but I did try and sip it, just to see what it tastes like. I wouldn't really say it has a taste, as the only thing I experienced as I sipped it was my entire mouth and oesophagus eroding as the spirit attacked my insides. The buffet arrived,
76850 10151265789141341 1899009383 n
and as usual, I was the first in line, surveying what was on offer, which all looked delicious, apart from the lime pickle in one of the dishes. For those who aren't familiar with this dish, lime pickle is used in the UK at Indian restaurants as an accompaniment to food, but has a horrendously overpowering sensation of bitter, sour and spicy. For the first time that day, I avoided the dish, basically because I knew it tastes like a 9 volt battery, the same however, could not be said for Rick. As we all sat down, I noticed the huge dollop of lime pickle in the middle of his plate, and it quickly crossed my mind, he had no idea what that was, I should have told him what it was....but I didn't.



Sat there trying not to smirk, and giving him the 'that looks good' expression on my face, I watched as he scooped up some lime pickle and went to eat it. It felt like a lifetime from the fork leaving the plate to reaching his mouth, but as soon as it did, and he began to chew on it, his facial expression was
229402 10151265819556341 1594179129 n
priceless. His eyes wider than the Mersey tunnel and open mouthed face was an absolute picture, followed by his outbursts of 'what the hell is that?' and 'oh my god! That’s hideous', as I sat there giggling like a school kid to myself, to which he realised that I knew what he had just eaten. Coincidentally, I felt a lot better at this time, probably because someone else in our group was not having the best of times.



We headed out of the spice farm slightly annoyed, we had wanted to go there for the sole reason of the elephants, we had seen pictures of them around the farm, but they were nowhere to be seen. We stopped at the entrance desk and enquired, and they simply told us to tell our driver and he would take us to them. A short drive around the corner (basically at the back of the spice farm), we came across the place to wash, feed and ride elephants, for a very small price. We went in and opted the wash, as we followed our elephant into a very familiar large stream that we had walked across not long before in
229962 10151265798081341 1751198887 n
the spice farm. The elephant walked into the stream and under the command of its owner, lay on its side, almost fully submerged in the water, apart from the tip of it's trunk. Lotty and I went in first, using a coconut shell, we scrubbed the massive creature as it lay so placid without a care in the world, while our Aussie mates took photo's for us. A few minutes later, the elephant was commanded to sit up, allowing us to climb on top of her, using her leg and bum cheek as steps to manoeuvre into position, this was the part we had all been looking forward to. We sat just behind the elephants head and waited as the owner gave a command....all was quiet, for a few seconds at least, then we realised what was happening as the elephants trunk rose from the water, over its head and squirted us with water like a fire hose. The command was basically to fill the trunk with water, and give us a shower, not for the first time that day. As we sat on the elephant getting even more drenched and trying to pose for pictures, a sudden feeling came
246684 10151265784766341 1742809795 n
over me, one that I had felt in Udaipur when we got caught up in the passing festivals. This day, that had started so bad for so many reasons, and had proceeded to get worse, was now one of those days that I will look back on for years and years to come as one of the best experiences in India, and of all time.



Anyway, enough of that soppy crap, about 10 minutes passed by and we got wetter and wetter and wetter, the owner asked if we would like to get down, Lotty did, but I stayed on, feeling like Mogli from the jungle book as me and my elephant sat chilling in the stream, with me getting a torrent of water sprayed in my face every minute or so. Eventually I felt that I'd had enough, and it was time for the Aussies to have their turn to wash this oversized creature and have a cannon of water fired at them repeatedly. As they had done for us, we took pictures for them as they enjoyed their time on top of our new favourite animal.



We left the site and headed
247752 10151265768741341 1146118188 n
back to our hotel, all with massive grins on our faces, and all had the same things to say about what we had just experienced with the elephant, we all loved it, and it was our favourite thing that we had done in India so far. Arriving back, we decided to have a quick shower and change, and head to the beach to see what there was to do for the next day. We walked up the beach, which was full of locals, as ever starring at us as if we had just came up with a cure for being a Man United fan (I hope that one day someone will find a cure for this terrible disease), and were surprised that we were the only westerners around. So, doing what westerners do best, we headed for a shop to buy some beer, the perfect hangover cure of course. The girls being sensible, declined our offer of a Kingfisher Strong (which by the way is beautiful, even if it is 8%) so we headed back along the beach, beers in hand looking like a couple of typical chav's swigging on their tennants super strength lager, when we noticed another of
253094 10151250982346341 2062421180 n
the girls waving at us hysterically as if she was about to eaten by a walrus. Heading over to the bar she was in with another lad, we pulled some tables together and got even more beer, and a shisha for the table obviously. Time passed by quite quickly as it suddenly became almost time for our last meal with the group, so rapidly heading back to the hotel, we met up with everyone.



I always looked forward to our evening dinners with the group, but with this being our last, I felt quite sad about it too, but I knew we'd have a good time. Our restaurant was on the beach and we'd been told by our guide (who know's his stuff about eating in India), that this one of the best in the region. As always, we analysed the menu while gulping down the very cold and very cheap beer, and I had opted for a seafood dish, as that's what Goa is famous for. Pomfret stuffed with prawns is what I had asked for when the waiter came over, but he told me that this dish is not good, the fish is horrible, and

all you can taste is prawns, feeling a bit disappointed and also trusting him, I asked for his recommendation, as my previous choices have turned out to be a vulgar green colour, so tandoori red snapper it was.



While we waited for our food, I felt a bit nervous (as I had done the night before), had I made the right choice? Was I going to be severely disappointed? This was our last meal together, I really wanted to have a good dish, and when it was placed down infront of me, I knew I had done the right thing. The food was spectacular, they hadn't bothered chopping the fishes head of tail off, they just covered it in spices and threw it in the oven, I couldn't get enough of it, if the curry I had the previous night was the best one I've ever had, this was the best seafood I've ever had. I wished we had more time with the group to eat at more amazing places like this, but all good things must come to an end, but not before we got say a group thank you to our guide.

We had mentioned getting him a gift, like a bottle of rum, but they only cost £3.80, and getting him one each is a bit excessive, so we opted for money, think of it as a large tip. While he was engaged in conversation, we passed an envelope under the table to each other and put the agreed amounts in and came up with a plan of when to give it him. Rick went out for a cigarette and asked Shaz (our guide) to join him, but Shaz had just had one, I started to think of another plan, before Rick insisted Shaz joined him, that was our cue to get ready. As soon as they went down the steps onto the beach I stood up, ushering everyone outside to join them, much to the surprise of Shaz who with a confused look began asking what was going on. Rick then began talking, telling Shaz that the cigarette was an excuse to get him out here as we had something to say....and then passed proceedings over to me. With everyone's eyes fixed on me, I knew I had to make this special, I had to highlight how good Shaz had
255517 10151265814791341 242997639 n
been to us over the past couple of weeks, every time we needed something, Shaz sorted it, every time we went somewhere, ate some where, visited somewhere, Shaz was the guy who made sure we got there, got what we wanted and saw what we wanted. I know it's all part of the job, but when the guy is on call to us 24/7 for 15 days, he needs to be shown much more gratitude than just a thank you.



I don't know how I did it, but I managed to pull off a speech that seemed to impress my fellow travellers, with most of them congratulating me later on my public speaking skills. Shaz does these tours all the time, all across India with only a couple of days off inbetween, a few days later, he'd have a different group to look after, but I wanted him to always remember us for as long as he could. As I ended the speech and passed him the envelope, I could see in his eye that what I had just said really meant something to him, and people didn't do that kind of thing all the time, he
283509 10151265786906341 392369171 n
gave a quick speech back thanking us all for taking part and everyone headed back inside, me and Rick stayed outside for a short while when Shaz highlighted how we'd made the trip so much fun for him, our constant jokes and banter must have been a change to the norm of what he's used to, but nevertheless, I felt good for making the speech.



We left the restaurant and headed for the bar we had visited the previous night, me and Lotty only stayed for one because I felt pretty rough, probably from beer, probably from all the food I'd just eaten, but we decided to get our heads down for the night. The next day was departure day, we were free to leave at any time, and most of the older ones did, but we had decided to hire a couple of mopeds and head down to Baga beach to have a ride on some jet-ski's. Paying 250 ruppees (£2.90) for a moped, without asking for our driving licenses our if we knew how to drive one, we set off stopping at the same restaurant we had breakfast in the previous day. As we sat
311292 10151265770696341 2027944013 n
there waiting for our food, the heavens once again opened, we waited for a few hours to see if the rain would pass by so we could head to the beach, but it didn't. We sadly decided that it was our time to leave the group and head to south Goa to our accommodation that we had booked separately to the trip, as the weather would probably be better there.



Saying goodbye to the group was quite upsetting, and it's different than when you say goodbye to someone you meet on a 2 week holiday elsewhere. We had been through so much together, over the past 15 days, travelling from Delhi to Goa, experiencing the highs and lows of India, the moto for G Adventures (the company we used) was “embrace the bizzare”, and we had all done that so well as a group. We had all been there for each other, lent money when the useless ATM's of India didn't accept anything other than curry leaves, shared stories of our home countries and towns and really had a good time together. I think the thing that upset me the most, was from that point until we
375905 10151265773971341 361631650 n
get to Australia, it was just me and Lotty, how on earth was I going to survive the next couple of months with just her? God help me. We said our goodbyes, both feeling upset, although we knew we were going to see Rick and Amanda because they live 10 mins from where we will be staying in Melbourne, and we would meet up with Louise.



Back at the hotel, again drenched from the rain, we dropped our moped off and met up with Shaz, who told us that he'd sort out a taxi for us to take us to south Goa. After our final farewell and another thank you for all that he had done for us, we set off in some sort of mini van type thing, with our 90 year old driver not being able to get out of 2nd gear, or go over 25 miles per hour. A journey that should have taken 1 hour took nearly double as he had to stop a few times to ask locals where the hotel was, and eventually we arrived. The hotel was amazing, certainly a step up from the cheap and not so cheerful cesspit’s
385110 10151265785231341 222021125 n
that we had stayed in over the last 15 days, and it had a clean pool, which was nice. As we only had the one night in the hotel (due to our original direct flight from Goa to Sri Lanka being cancelled) we decided to make the most of our time there, got a quick shower, changed, and headed for a stroll down the beach.



South Goa was definitely a much more idyllic setting than where we had just come from, the beach was deserted, no one trying to sell us anything, it was pure bliss. We discussed how, although it may cost slightly more, we thought our trip should have ended in south Goa, it really was just what we needed after a heavy, hectic and fast paced schedule travelling the country, and we wished our fellow travellers could have been there to soak up the very welcoming sunshine that we enjoyed. We stopped for lunch (and beer obviously) on the way back to the hotel, and enjoyed a quick dip in the hotel pool, before making sure we had everything ready for our very early departure to the airport the next morning.


404075 10151265819121341 1630422101 n

5am was our pick up time from the hotel to quickly whisk us to the airport to catch our flight to Chennai, where we would stay for 1 night. This all seems a bit pointless, staying in south Goa for less than 24 hours, flight across to the other side of India, but there is a reason. Our original plan was to spend 2 full days in south Goa, then fly from there to Sri Lanka, but the ever so pleasant people at Kingfisher Airways, decided to go bankrupt not long before we left the country. Due to us having accommodation already paid for in Sri Lanka on a certain date, the only feasible way of sorting another flight was to cut our stay in south Goa down to 1 night, get a flight from there to Chennai, stay there for 1 night, then fly out the next morning, it was a real pain in the arse. So, we got to the airport, and my god, it's an absolute dump, looks like it was designed by a blind hippy, built by the entire cast of Trainspotting and had survived several civil wars, of all the airports I've ever visited, this
408590 10151265772576341 973693678 n
one was the absolute worst.



Thankfully, due to the stupid hour that we got there, the time went pretty quickly, and even though the flight was late, we made it away from that dreadful airport. As was becoming more common, we got fed on the flight, again it was only a short one, about 1 hour 15 minutes, and it was breakfast time, I was so happy. I had a quick look at the food, one of the things on my tray being an omelette, and quickly got to work scoffing the food, which was delicious, until I realised it had green chillies in it. I don't mind spicy food, but not at silly o'clock in the morning, for my breakfast, on a plane, by now I was seriously craving a good bacon butty.



We arrived in Chennai, got our bags and headed to our hotel in a taxi, about a half an hour drive away. The hotel was amazing, a 5 star hotel with security guards who check the boot of the car, and underneath to make sure there are no explosives, or other dangerous devices. Once inside, every single staff member stopped
429350 10151265778756341 1297079408 n
what they were doing, placed their hand on the heart, bowed, and greeted you, this was the sort of service I could have done with over the past few weeks. We checked in and headed to our room, collapsing on the beds from lack of sleep and waking up a few hours later, just in time to order some room service, as we had missed out on lunch.



We didn't leave the hotel, party because we didn't have time, and mostly because I couldn't be bothered, I'd seen most of it from the taxi to the airport. A few hours later it was time for dinner, and our last meal in India, so what do you have for your last meal in India? A Chinese of course! The hotel had a roof top restaurant overlooking Chennai, but it only served Chinese food, but we ate there anyway, more for the novelty of the restaurant being on the rooftop. Our waiter was ever so polite but didn't half ask some idiotic questions, like when he came over with our drinks, he placed my bottle of beer down with the lid still on and asked me if I would
486781 10151265774771341 427130082 n
like him to open it. I replied 'yes please' while thinking, no it's alright mate, you leave that bottle there, and I'll use my super human powers to extract the beer through the glass bottle and ingest it that way, bloody moron! The food was quite nice, although again, the waiter made a slight balls up. He brought my main course out, then a short while later, Lotty's starter arrived, then my starter, then Lotty's main course, all the while he was trying to split each dish between the 2 of us. I put this down to him not understanding why we ordered starters and main courses, but all in all, the food was good.



We headed down to one of the hotel bars for one drink before we went to bed, and for the first time in India, I saw a place that sold kingfisher on draught, but looking back I wish I never had one. In the UK, cleaning beer lines is a weekly task to ensure that the best quality beer is being served, as yeast builds up in the lines, hampering the taste, although I'm not too sure that this method of cleaning
487916 10151265816341341 1536608596 n
has been discovered in India. I'd drank Kingfisher in bottles of the last few weeks and loved it, but the stuff on draught tastes like horse wee (no I don't drink horse wee, but I would rather have done so that night), I felt like I needed to bleach the taste from my mouth.



Reluctantly finishing my beer, we got our bags packed (again) and got our heads down for our final night in India. Next morning, after a quick balls up trying to organise a taxi, we had to settle for the hotel to take us, which was 3 times more expensive, but the cars did have air conditioning and free bottles of water, so yet again, we headed to the airport. We checked in with no problems, and with nothing to do, we sat in a corner and waited for our flight to be called, I kept checking the screens just to be sure. Without thinking what I was putting on earlier that morning, I grabbed a Liverpool top, thinking nothing of it, until a guy in the airport that looked like Usain Bolt walked past me, pointed at my top, smiling and said something
535989 10151265773176341 2008501495 n
which sounded like he was offering me a guinea pig I think.



Not long later we began to board our flight to Sri Lanka, after the past few weeks I couldn't wait to lie on a beach for a few weeks and relax after the hustle and bustle of India. But looking back and thinking about things, I really didn't want to go to India, it was the one country out of all the one's we were going to that I was not looking forward to the most, but I had the time of my life. I think what made it better was the people we did it with, there is no way me and Lotty would have been able to do that tour on our own, without a guide and the friends we made along they way. The sights, sounds, smells, experiences not to forget the good times with others, the drunken conversations and even the sober ones too, all made the trip well worth it. I was happy to be leaving India to see a new country, but I knew deep down that I would truly miss it, I though Morocco was really insane, India
536534 10151265773646341 230624653 n
takes insane to a whole new level. I never though I'd ever say this, but I loved India and everything about it, and I'd have no problems in going back and doing it all over again.

It's International Day of the Girl-Child!

For those of you who do not know, today (Thursday, October 11, 2012), is the first International Day of the Girl-Child. This is an UN-sanctioned holiday, celebrating the importance of educating young women throughout the world. If you are in the United States, odds are that you haven’t heard about it, or, if you have, it was in passing and had no major impact on your daily life. At Shanti Bhavan, however, we (volunteers, teachers, and male and female students) have been preparing for weeks to put together a celebration worthy of TV.

You see, SB has partnered up with Intel (yes, THAT Intel), who wanted to show its support for girls’ education in India. Therefore, they have helped us prepare a big shindig, with speeches and entrepreneurship classes for the older girls and the presentation of a new song (written by the lovely Lizzy to the tune of “Lean on Me”) sung by the girls in the choir. They even allowed my eleventh graders some time to present art projects inspired by the idea of “education for all.” These events are going to be videotaped, and then eventually (according to my
Choir Rehearsal
understanding) be used for Intel promotions. I am quite excited to be part of this celebration, because I feel that it recognizes a deep need in society, and while in India, I have seen evidence of the gender disparities.

I write this entry with some level of wariness, as I don’t want to be that traveler who draws drastic, ignorant conclusions based on some choice encounters. You should be aware, therefore, that the information I write here is based on a month’s exposure to the Indian culture, and is therefore not nearly as nuanced as it could eventually be. I feel compelled, though, to bring out certain observations (both my own and other volunteers’) regarding gender relations in India. I do this because SB is unusual in its dedication to education for everyone, and at times even its students struggle with gender equality because of the gender expectations of the society.



Firstly, I’d like to point out that, as a white woman, I am an outlier. Depending on the situation, I am treated both “as a woman” and “as a man.” For instance, when riding on public transportation, Indian women ideally sit next to a relation
Art Process
Babu working on his group's sculpture: ""The Statue of Liberty.""
or another woman. When given the option between seating a white woman or an Indian woman next to a man, the bus official will always choose the white woman (because then the Indian woman can sit next to her). However, whenever possible, the bus officials will seat white women next to other women (or white people). I have also noticed this when people would stop us to take pictures with us. One man, who wanted to take a picture of Peter and me with his wife and son, insisted that the wife stand next to me instead of the son, but some younger folks don’t take those precautions.

As I mentioned before in “Humming in Hampi,” there was a distinct lack of women celebrating at the Ganesha Immersion procession. What I didn’t mention before was their eyes. They were gathered together at Virupaksha Temple, watching the festivities from behind a fence (not built for this purpose, mind you, but a barrier all the same) with a haunting darkness in their expressions. In my English classes, we read a poem called “An Old Woman” by Arun Kolatkar that has the lines: “You look right at the sky./ Clear through the
""The Statue of Liberty""
The sculpture's right half is uneducated (carries a dustbin and a frown); the left half is educated (carries a book and a smile).
bullet holes/ she has for her eyes.” And that’s the sort of thing I saw in their gazes. It made me feel like a traitor or a schoolyard bully—that I was taunting them with my privilege to dance. In retrospect, I wish I had stood next to them, talked to them, instead of giving in to my rhythmic (or, rather, arrhythmic) impulses. I can’t help but wonder what they were thinking, seeing all of these foreign women participate in their ancient celebration, when they themselves cannot?

Stephanie, one of my coworkers, spent the week off in Kerala, and she went through several rural villages, visiting friends and their relatives. One of these friends even agreed to bring together a group of men from the village to answer her questions. She asked things about their lifestyle, about their quality of life, and about the infrastructure of the area. At some point, she got onto the topic of alcohol, and the men started talking about how they worked all day and would often go drink in order to decompress. Stephanie, who knew that rural women are not allowed to do this, asked, “What about the women? They work hard
Manjula Presenting ""The Statue of Liberty""
all day, too. Don’t they deserve the same thing?” The men responded by saying that that wasn’t what a woman should be doing. Then Stephanie started asking about gender, and the men became uncomfortable, saying that they had to focus on fixing the caste system before they could fix gender relations. Then, when asked what would happen in women ruled the world, the men’s response was very telling, “The women would punish us for what we’ve done to them.”

One thing that may strike a person in rural India is that women always seem to be “dressed up,” even when they’re working in the field. They wear their colorful, beautiful saris and gold nose piercings and earrings and necklaces. To the American eye, it seems strange, but upon further thought, I realized that they were wearing their wealth. Many rural folks do not have access to banks, and the gold would not be safe in a poor Indian home (if there is a structure at all—I cannot tell you how many tarp-homes I have seen along the sidewalks in the city). So, they wear what they own, and, in effect, are forced to display what they are
Shrimathi's Collage (see video)
worth.

I have noticed that a woman’s appearance in India is highly valued. As in the United States, ads are inundated with products meant to improve women’s looks. You have the usual shampoos and creams and what have you, but you also have things like skin whitener, which really gets under my skin (excuse the pun). I know that this is also a product in the United States, and I am equally disgusted by it, no matter where it is. Watching movies in India, I am struck by how many of the popular male actors are darker than the female actors. Looking at the mixture of faces at SB, I am struck by how beautiful all of the girls are, and yet how some of them are going to go into the world and be considered less beautiful because they were born with darker skin. That is a problem that the boys will never have to face.

I can see evidence of these various forms of social oppression, even at SB. The girls are often quieter, and have less self-confidence than the boys. In one of the first papers I assigned—“Which character in Macbeth do you most admire?”—I was amazed at how many girls said Lady Macbeth. They commented on her power, “even” over a man, and discussed how important it was for them to have “control.” In class, conversations that would have been purely informational in the United States become jarringly real. For instance, I was lecturing yesterday about Edgar Allan Poe, and started (as I often do) with his life history, including the information that he married his 13-year-old cousin when he was much older. There was a bit of a strange pause after I said that, and then one of the boys asked, “They do that in the United States?” I assured him that they used to, but it is very rare now. He paused, then replied, “They do that in India, you know.”

How is a person supposed to respond to something like that?

But here, on International Day of the Girl-Child, I am struck by how wonderful these students are, and how lucky they are. This blog includes their art projects, and a couple of their presentations, in hopes that they can tell you about their experiences in their own words. There is hope for equality, and this is just the beginning.



Love,

Lynn

Holy Cow
Forgot the Holy Cows
Wow I've done it here in India at last, first impressions, not too sure jet lagged tired, ready to get my bearings in this crazy, people filled land, I read it takes a few days to adjust, well lets see how it goes, I rest my weary head ready to face all India has to offer tomorrow.

On opening my bedroom curtains the next morning, I am staying opposite a train station there are people everywhere crossing the tracks, walking down the road, trains with people hanging out the carriages, I am in India, I have arrived.

First impressions I have hired a guide for the day, this is my way when I arrive in a large city to see the sights and adjust to the new environment, a guide can take the stress out of navigating a big city, plus added bonus of keeping at arms distance, beggars, touts etc works well for me. Women in sari's everywhere the colours are magnificent, see my first holy cow, had forgotten about those, walking down the highway, oblivious to the traffic, I will get very used to this sight. Noise the noise is defeaning, people everywhere, its crazy but I

cant stop looking the sights the smells, this is what they were talking about, India I am here.

Have seen the sights of Chennai modern shopping malls, ancient temples, crowds of people, its a bustling, busy noisy city a blend of the ancient and the new. Had my first taste of a Indian railway station, take my place in the line, what line, people pushing in front, its chaos, hey this is India a billion people dont get anywhere waiting in line.

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Tranquebar
September 30th 2012
Published: October 5th 2012


Tranquebar
It was an early winter morning. I was on a smoke break with my friend and colleague Ben. After a grueling night shift this smoke discussion had to be something interesting. I like this guy because his information and knowledge are quite authentic which is missing amongst most of my office colleagues. We were discussing about Pondicherry and the forgone French cultural surroundings. Suddenly, I heard the name ‘Tharangambadi’ for the first time from Ben. He is a Christian guy and regularly pays visit to The Velankini Church. He said that Tharangambadi was between Chidambaram and Karaikal. I knew about these two places for their own cultural receptiveness however never heard of Tharangambadi before.

I am no longer a young lad now, almost crossed 35 years of my life. The more my ‘grey hair’ growing in numbers, the more I am trying to become a ‘Jack of all trades’. Thanks to the world of internet. After reaching home, at least I had some food for thought. Upon researching, found a lot of interesting details about Tharangambadi.

Tharangambadi means the ""place of the singing waves"". It is a small village in Nagapattinam district, 15 km from the Port Town, Karaikal
Dansborg Fort
and about 121km from Pondicherry. In 1620, Danish East India Company formed their settlement here and named this place as ‘Tranquebar’. A factory (commercial settlement) was opened and a fort, known as Fort Dansborg, was built by a Danish captain named Ove Gjedde. This fort was the residence and headquarters of the governor and other officials for about 150 years. It was a Danish colony from 1620 to 1845, and in Danish it is still known as Trankebar.It was very interesting information indeed. I heard about other Danish Colonies in India, like Port Blair and Sreerampore in West Bengal however Tharagambadi was rather unknown to me. Years passed by, I was looking for a chance to visit this place. Finally, when I decided to visit Thirunallar temple, somehow I found Tharangambadi was closer by. But, again the time was too tight to visit this place. Nevertheless, as I decided, so no way looking back.

It was around 11 am and I was hovering around the bus stand of Kumbakonam. I was looking for a bus to Tharangambadi. After a few failed enquires; I found that it was either busses don’t ply from Kumbakonam to Tharangambadi or people here in
From the Northern side
Kumbakonam were not aware of this place. I was really in a big disguise on what to do next. Suddenly, there was a guy who came forward and rescued me from this hullaballoo. As per his suggestion, I was supposed to take a bus to Mayiladuthurai from here and from there I would be getting plenty of buses to Tharangambadi. Without wasting any more time, I boarded a bus which was ready to go to Mayiladuthurai. The ride from Kumbakonam to Mayiladuthurai was usually a ride through small villages and towns. It was 35 km and the bus took more than an hour to reach Mayiladuthurai. It was a small town and nothing much to describe. I looked at my watch, it was 12:30pm and I knew that I didn’t have much time left. I checked with a few local folks but didn’t get a convincing answer about the buses to Tharangambadi. I waited for more than 45 minutes. I saw one bus arrived but before I could get my foot on that bus, it was all filled up. The next bus didn’t show up in 30 minutes. It was 1:30 pm, I was really tensed. Finally, I just walked
The South Part
out of the bus stand and found a couple of taxis were parked outside. I fixed one of them for Rs. 700/-. The guy would drop me at Thirunallar via Tharangambadi. Mayiladuthurai to Tharangambadi was around 30km so it was not a tough deal. The guy’s name was Muthu, seemed to be nice fellow. We started from Mayiladuthurai in next 10 minutes. The ride was just beautiful. Tall trees, dark tar road with a lot of twisting turns and curves.

We took no less than 45 minutes to reach Tranquebar. As mentioned earlier, it was a small village with not many settlements around. We entered the Danish Colony after crossing a big gateway. Wow ! it was a different world. It seemed, I was in some foreign country enriched with historical buildings. In next 5 minutes, I was in front the Dansborg Fort which I have longed to see for years. It was a Sunday, so as expected a few locals were enjoying the weekend evening. I paid Rs.5 for entry ticket and Rs. 30 for still camera.

I walked in. Just next to the main entrance, there was a small stone on the right which describes what
Gjedde Memorial
Tranquebar was all about. This fort was constructed in 1620 though it had been reconstructed several times. The rampart wall is a fairly large four sided structure, with bastions at each cardinal point. A single storied building was constructed along three inner sides of the rampart, with barracks, warehouse, kitchen and jail. The rooms on the southern side remain in good condition, but the rooms on the western and northern sides have been substantially damaged. On the eastern side of the fort, there was a two storied building facing the sea. It was the main building of the fort. The vaulted lower storey served as a magazine and a warehouse, while the vaulted upper storey contained the church and the lodging of the governor, the senior merchants and the chaplain. The sea on the eastern and western side protected the fort. I decided to take stroll from left to right. This is actually a small fort. If you would expect an ‘Agra fort’ or a ‘Junagadh fort’ you would be surprised. This fort has a small museum which bestows a few mementos of the bygones. I found a small canon was placed overlooking the sea which seemed never been fired.
Witnessing the time
It didn’t take more than 30 minutes for me to explore this fort but the fort had something which was dragging me to visit again and again. Locals claimed that during the devastating Tsunami in 2004 this fort had a close shave. I walked out and found a few fishermen were busy doing their daily business. A couple of colorful boats were sleeping at the shore. One Young Turk was watching me for sometime as I was clicking snaps. Upon asking, he requested me to click one snap with his friends. His name was Ramu and he earns his living by catching fishes around the coast of Tharangambadi. I walked to the left side of the beach and found a small temple. I knew that this temple was partially damaged during Tsunami and had been reconstructed recently. I was clicking around and did notice one villager was offering his mid day prayer. His name was Chiniyan. I stroke up a small chat with him.

‘How long have you been staying here?’, was my question

‘Since my dad,my grand father all of them were born here’, it was a straight answer.

‘I heard that this temple was damaged
Masilamani Nathar Temple
during Tsunami’, sounded a bit stupid but I was really not sure what to ask.

‘Yes, the god saved himself but didn’t save others. Nothing will be left. The daemon will swallow everything one day like my wife, my kids’, that was a hard answer from him which left me completely silent. I knew that around 30,000 people were washed away in this area during Tsunami , 2004 but I never expected I would meet up someone who had seen his beloved flooded away.

‘I’m sorry’, was my counter reply.

‘No sir, why you should be sorry? Whatever, where are you from sir?’, he tried to make me feel easy.

‘Chennai, but I’m actually from Kolkata’, I was really not sure what to tell him.

‘Chennai? Yes,know that place but never heard of Kolkata, is it bigger than Chennai?, he asked me.

‘May be, but they are all big cities’, I was trying to cut it short.

‘Thank you sir for visiting this place, nobody comes here except a few guys doing some research or some students from Karaikal to booze around. The devil will eat everyone’, Chiniyan left with varying his last
Pray for what????
statement over and over.

I was desperately looking for a place to sit. His words had me moved far away from this place. It was really too difficult for me to digest his ‘hard truths’. They believe in ‘the show must go on’ life and have faith in this small ‘Masilamani Nathar’ temple still. After spending another 30 minutes on that temple, I decided to wrap my day for the day. I was not willing to click any further. I saw one lady was selling some snacks but unfortunately there was no one to buy. Her blunt look definitely told a story of struggle and survival. I was really feeling scared to talk to her. The people here lost everything what they weaved for years but nobody stopped dreaming. The fishing boats still venture early in the morning. The sun rises everyday showering the first ray of light. The Dansborg Fort stands still witnessing ‘The singing waves’ for past 300 years. Tranquebar was Captain Gjedde’s dream and would remain standing tall for years. Chiniyan walked into the horizon, the snacks selling lady left home for the day but the fort stood still with a smile. Tharangambadi is really ‘The
Ramu and his buddys
town of the singing waves’ but there’s no one to listen. All the listeners are sleeping deep into the ocean.

How To Go :

Buses are not that frequent from Mayilladuthurai which is 30 km away but Karaikal, which is just 15 km away is a better option. Taxis can be hired from both Karaikal and Mayliaduthurai. They run on ‘to and fro’ rates and rates are more than a fixed one with lesser chances to bargain.

Where to stay :

There are very less options to stay at Tharangambadi

1) ‘Bungalow At The Beach’ was an old Governor’s Bungalow which is about 4000/- @ night.

2) TTDC runs a small hotel @ 800/- for a double bed room.

3) ‘The Gate House’ is another Old Heritage Danish Bungalow which was converted into a hotel and would charge you around Rs 3000/- per night.

When to Visit :

Avoid Summer, else Tharangambadi can be visited for the rest of the months. November to February would be good.

My PT Chums
So, I decided to write this blog because I had the following conversation in my head:



Friend: Well, Lynn, you’ve been at Shanti Bhavan for over a week. You’ve surely fallen into a routine by now!

Me: Well, gosh, I guess I have.

Friend: Tell me, Lynn, what is that routine?

Me: Shucks, I’m sure glad you asked. Let me tell you…



An average day at SB starts around 6:30 a.m., when the youngsters have PT (like PE). Three lucky volunteers get to encourage (/plead with/chase) the children around the PT field before doing stretches. Then they are basically free to do as they will until breakfast at 7:30. I’ve been taken under the wing of the fourth and fifth grade girls, who like to play games like “langori” (a game a bit like jenga with a pile of rocks that you try to knock down then rebuild) and “chicken run” (a tagging game where the person who is “it” hops on one leg). Earlier this week, I fell while playing chicken run and scraped my knee and elbow for probably the first time since middle school. Feels a bit like a
Breakfast (Egg, Mushy Rice, Tea)
badge of honor.

At 7:30, breakfast is served in the open-air cafeteria. I often take a bath after PT and go to breakfast late. For the average American, breakfast can seem overwhelming. Unless we’re having pancakes, the food is rich with spices and ingredients (rice, vegetables) that the volunteers automatically categorize as “dinner.” But the masala chai tea served with breakfast, tea, and snack is wonderfully sweet and creamy, with the same consistency as hot chocolate. I could live off of the stuff.

After breakfast is the first three classes of the day. I have both of my main English classes at this time (1st and 3rd period). Depending on the day, I will also have an additional period for these classes later in the day. My busiest day is Fridays when I teach for six of the eight class sessions.

Afternoon tea and assembly follow. Assembly is always an adventure, with a mish-mash of presentations and announcements. It always starts with a universalist prayer, followed by a small skit performed by the 3rd-5th graders. These skits are my daily dose of cute, as they are meant to teach the nuances of the value of the week.
Assembly: The News for Today
This week was “unity” week, and had some winning moments such as when one little boy explained that we can compromise when we play, so “don’t worry, be happy.” Assembly also includes a group of older students giving “the news for today,” which includes local, international, science, and business news. After the news, questions, and announcements, Vice Principal Miss Beena rises and says, “Good morning,” to which the whole school replies, “Good morning, Miss Beena.” Needless to say, the whole affair is very formal.

After that, we have two more class periods, then lunch. Followed by three more class periods. After I finish that (around 3:35 p.m.), I have until 6:00 p.m. to do as I please. My mission today? LAUNDRY! But wait a second, world! This isn’t just any ordinary laundry. This is hand-washed, hang-dried, electricity’s out in the building laundry! In other words, I won’t know how clean my clothes are until later. Electricity outages are frequent—you can expect it to go on and off at least three times every 24 hours. We use the electricity for so little here: lights, charging computers, and ceiling fans, but when it’s dark, or your computer is out of juice,
The Cafeteria
or the weather is unseasonably hot (as it has been here in the past couple of days, with little rain or air-movement), you become acutely aware of how much you depend on electricity to make your life comfortable. Even right now, I’m racing against the clock because my computer is nearly dead and there’s no telling when the power is going to surge back to life.

From 6-7:30 most nights, I have to supervise prep, which is basically study hall. Then off to supper, then off to a fifteen-minute story-time with an assigned grade. This week I was given the fourth graders, which is a rowdy but loveable group. They are fascinated by the snake-light I use each night, and ask me about my clothes or my jewelry or my education. Today one noticed a picture of my cat, Cleopatra, attached to my backpack, and asked me about her. They also act as if they’re really picky about the books read to them, but today I brought along Millions of Cats (Millions and billions and trillions of cats) and Are You My Mother? and they were totally into it.

And now, after all of
Laundry!
this, I get an opportunity to write to you, and show you pictures, and check my email (some habits die hard). This next week is a break, so I will be traveling a bit and I hope to have lots of fun stories to share by the end of the week! Take care, and happy Friday!

September 15th 2012

Me, Ally, and Stephanie on our way to Hosur (via rickshaw)
Today was my first excursion day into India! Ally (my roommate), Stephanie (co-worker), and I traveled by auto-rickshaw to the small city of Hosur. Most of the drive was beautiful, with vast landscapes and a sunny day. People were walking by with their goats, cows, and donkeys, and people were sitting on their stoops doing chores. I spent most of the ride trying to catch images that would have been gorgeous if I knew when to press the button on my camera while we rushed by the subject of interest.

When we arrived in the city, though, my senses were rattled by the noise--in India, you use your carhorn to communicate every possible message, from ""Get out of the way"" to ""I'm passing you"" to ""How you doin'?"" to ""I'm coming around this blind corner!"" And in a city with traffic, I cannot understand how anyone knows who is honking at who. It's a panic attack waiting to happen.

In any case, we started at this lovely restaurant called Janani. It turns out that Stephanie is quite the linguistic socialite, and she quickly endeared herself with the waitstaff by practicing her Tamil and asking for phrases. They actually approached
View from the rickshaw
us to ask if they could take a picture with us with their phones. This was my first experience of ""celebrity"" as Stephanie called it. In general, it did sort of feel that way. The waitstaff were very excited to have Americans in their restaurant, and some children would speak to us in English and smile. But, then again, some people stared, some took pictures, some scowled. I'd argue that it wasn't ""celebrity"" as much as just plain ""otherness.""

After lunch, our rickshaw driver took us clothes shopping, and we bought several very cheap kurtas (tunics, 100 rupees ($2) each) at a street vendor before moving onto a bigger store that sold full outfits. Sadly, I had little success at the bigger store because the ensemble that I had my heart set on was only made in size 2XL and could not be tailored for me. But I will have plenty of opportunities to search for a new favorite, so I figure I'm in no hurry.

When I'm in street-walking mode abroad, I tend to avoid eye contact and look stern, as if I know exactly what I'm doing. Because of this, I wasn't as aware of our
Our new friends in Hosur
""celebrity"" as my friends. It was impossible to ignore the fact that we were of interest, though, when a beggar woman grabbed my sleeve tightly and tried to keep me from going to the rickshaw. I hate to think about how harshly I had to pull away from her, and how loudly I had to say, ""No!"" I had been warned that beggars could be aggressive, but I was shocked by how desperately she clung to me. The problem is, if you give something to one beggar, you are swarmed--Stephanie had experienced this in the past the hard way. But I can't help but wonder if I maybe should have given her the coconut water I had just bought at a grocery store.

I again tried to take a lot more pictures on the way back to SB, with some success. And about 5 minutes from SB it began to rain. It came in the open sides of the rickshaw, so by the time we reached the gates, all four of us (including the driver) were yelling and laughing, which was a wonderfully refreshing way to end the trip.

The guest house, where I live
Although I love to keep people's anticipation high, I feel that it's about time I introduced you all to Shanti Bhavan. After all, as of 3:30 a.m. tomorrow morning, I will have been at Shanti Bhavan for 48 hours!

First impressions are hard to express because there are so many battling for the page right now. So, some quick basics (Minnesota-style, if you will):

The weather here is very pleasant, and very dry. It's supposed to be monsoon season, but I have yet to see a drop, and other volunteers who have been here longer said it has been a while. But the temperature is comfortable day and night, and I am indoors for most of the day, so no sunburn yet!

The food is suiting me well so far. A couple of things have caught me off-guard, but in general it is not very spicy at all. For right now, at least, I enjoy all of the rice!

No, bugs are not that bad at all. The worst part is the gnats, which tend to hover at the periphery of your vision when you're trying to talk to someone. Oh, and then there's that spider who
My room
decided to hang out in my bathroom (no worries, I caught it in true spider-tarian (like humanitarian, right?) fashion).

I have been placed with the 11th and 12th grade English classes, which is very exciting for me. The students are responsive and thoughtful. I have one student who, after initially asking me point-blank how ""The Red Wheelbarrow"" by good old William Carlos Williams could be any good, decided that it was a representation of the sun. Good stuff. I am also working with a very small elective literature course which has proven a bit more of a challenge for me--Those students have to study the poetry of this Hopkins guy that I've never heard of and whose poetry (to me at least) seems bland. And doing poetry stuff one-on-two feels more like grilling than teaching. Any good pointers on how to make analyzing poetry fun for two students, please send it my way!

So, now for a general idea of how my life has gone since my airplane ride:

I arrived at the Bangalore airport at 12:30 a.m. on Sept 12. I got through customs and everything pretty easily. And, after some initial searching among the hundred
A spider friend
or so cabbies waiting for jet-lagged customers, I found mine, who was a pleasant man maybe in his early thirties. We made some small talk during the 2 hour drive, but I generally just watched the city/landscape. We went through some pretty dingy-looking places, and I could not tell you how many stray dogs were almost ran over by my taxi, but I made it safely to Shanti Bhavan and was immediately swept up to my room where my roommate, Ally, was fast asleep.

These past two days have been a bit of a whirlwind. I didn't experience any jetlag, thank goodness. I can't imagine how I would have functioned if I had! I was told my class assignments, and immediately brought up to introduce myself to my classes. Apparently, the students I'm teaching have been missing an English teacher for a little while now, and they just spend the hour in their homeroom when no teacher is there for them. So I introduced myself, got their names, and asked them what they were studying. Both groups are studying the same material--In 12th grade, Indian students are expected to take a large test called the Indian School Certificate (ISC)
View from my window
and both grades are working toward that eventual test. What this means, however, is that the 12th-graders are reading the exact same material they read last year. Luckily, I have been given permission to supplement with other pieces so that they don't get bored out of ther minds.

I have been told that I will soon take over the choir, and probably work on presentational skills with students once I get settled in. I'm looking forward to working with all ages, and to getting to share the arts.

The students here are very talkative and bubbly, and they are very curious. One of the questions I am asked a lot is if I have any siblings, and after that what are my family's birthdays! They have a very structured day, with PT (equivalent to PE) at 6:30 a.m. and classes from 8:30-3:35. Of course, in between there is tea, then assembly, then lunch, and immediately after classes is snack. And then more PT time. And shower time. And then prep, which is basically study hall. Then Supper, and right back to prep (for the older ones) until 9:30 p.m. I can't imagine having that structured of a day,
The School Patio
every day except Sunday. But I guess that's just the college in me talking--I'm not used to being told where to go all the time anymore.

All in all, this is a beautiful place, with lots of energy and life to it. I hope to take some pictures of the kids (or let the kids take some pictures--they LOVE to do that) tomorrow, but Friday is also my busiest class day, so no promises. In any case, Ally and I (and possibly other volunteers) are planning on going to Hosur this weekend. It is about 30 minutes away and seems to be a pretty nice place from what I hear. I'm hoping to come out with some traditional long tops, as I always feel so frumpy when I stand next to the Indian teachers. Looking forward to it!

Well, off to lesson planning (and making poetry fun)!

Love,

Lynn

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Auroville
September 12th 2012
Published: September 12th 2012


Voila que la fin de mon voyage approche.

Mais avant de parler de mes derniers jours a Auroville, je dois vous parler encore un peu de la Sadhana Forest. Ben oui, je ne peux pas vous laisser comme ca sans vous avoir parler des douches et du lavage. La-bas, on fait tres tres tres attention a l'eau. Alors, que ce soit pour le lavage ou pour la douche, on doit d'abord se rendre a la cuisine pour puiser l'eau a la pompe, comme dans le bon vieux temps! On remplit donc un seau d'eau pour la douche ou deux pour le lavage. Comme les seaux sont grands et que l'eau ne se pompe pas comme par magie, ben il est rare que l'on remplit le seau au complet. Avec le temps, on a meme tendance a le remplir de moins en moins.

Pour moi, au cheveux courts, pas de trouble, je venais a bout de rincer adequatement mes cheveux et d'utiliser le minumum d'eau. Certaines filles n'avaient par contre pas le meme sentiment. Mais bon, moi, j'aimais bien prendre ma douche simplement, comme ca, a l'exterieur. Ceci etant dit, je suis content d'etre revenu a la Joy Guest House, ou la douche est aussi exterieur mais avec l'eau courrante. Tiens, je tacherai de faire un test la prochaine fois, voir si je rempli un seau d'eau durant ma douche. Hmm.... ca risque d'etre difficile a faire, ca me prendrait les gars de l'emission ""myth busters"" (casseurs de mythes?) pour m'aider.

Pour le lavage comme pour la douche, tout ce que nous utilisons comme savon et shampoing est biodegradable. Le savon est en barre pour le lavage comme pour la douche. Ensuite, les techniques varient pour le lavage. Pour ma part, je place le savon dans un petit bol, j'y ajoute de l'eau puis je brasse jusqu'a ce que l'eau soit suffisamment savonneuse. J'ajoute ensuite cet eau savonneuse a l'eau du premier seau puis j'y mets mes vetements avant de brasser allegrement le tout. Ensuite, je retire un morceau, je le tape vigoureusement sur l'enorme ""planche a laver collective"" de l'endroit et je tords pour extraire au maximum le savon. Le reste est simple. Je garoche dans l'eau propre pour rincer, je tords et j'etends. C'est une methode assez efficace pour laver son linge rapidement, toutefois, j'ai parfois eu la mauvaise surprise d'avoir des vetements ""propres"" qui sentaient pas tout a fait la fraicheur d'automne. Quel joie, de retour a la ""Joy guest House"" que le lavage soit fait pour nous dans une machine!!! Ceci etant dit, je prefere nettement laver mon linge a la main a l'exterieur que de le faire dans une toilette d'auberge...

A la Sadhana Forest, j'avais une entente avec les gens du lieu. Normalement, on payait que 200 roupies pour l'hebergement et les repas en echange de notre travail, mais on m'avait dit que tout le monde etait bienvenue la-bas, peu importe les origines ou les moyens financiers par exmple. Bien que 200 roupies soit peu (4$ par jour) mes reserves etaient egalement moindre. De plus, certains repas, comme le jeudi soir, le samedi et dimanche midi, n'etait pas fourni, nous devions donc sortir la plupart du temps pour s'acheter de la nourriture. Bref, je pouvais pas payer le plein pris et les gens de la Sadhana Forest, a qui j'avais bien explique ma situation, on gracieusement accepte que je ne paie que ce que je pouvais.

Entente ideale si je veux rester un bon bout de temps en Inde. Sauf que voila, la Sadhana Forest, c'est loin de tout. Il est complique pour quelqu'un qui n'a pas de moped (petite mobilette) ou autre moyen de transport motorise de sortir de l'endroit et moi, quand je ne peux me deplacer, je me sens pris. Bien que, d'une maniere, mes deux semaines a la Sadhana Forest furent parmi les plus belles de tout mon voyage, je me sentais libere quand j'en suis sorti.

Je vous avais dit que je vous parlerais aussi des belles rencontres. Bien y'en avait en masse du monde interessant la bas. Je vous ai deja parle du jeune acteur, Luca et de Greg, notre chanteur aux allures de Jesus. Je ne vous ai pas encore parle de Florent, un francais passionne par son metier (euh, biologiste mettons) et par la nature, il connaissait tous les serpents de la region et en prenait de magnifique photo avec son appareil (une canon 7D pour ceux que ca interesse) Oui, la foret regorgeait de bestioles magnifiques, cameleons, serpents venimeux et mortels, scorpions, fourmis agressives, chenille porc-epic, etc. Apres l'experience en communaute, Florent repartais et continuais son voyage en Inde et ailleurs en Asie... en velo!!! Il y en a qui sont encore plus aventurier que d'autres. C'etait aussi quelqu'un avec un superbe sens de l'humour avec qui je me suis bien entendu. En fait, je me suis bien entendu avec presque tout le monde.

Y'avait aussi du ben beau monde a la Sadhana Forest. La, j'ose pas trop donner de details, mon blogue est public apres tout... mais bon, de toute facon, je n'ai rien de croustillant a raconte (a ce moment, les spectateurs font : ""honnnnnnnnnn"")

Ah, et puis y'avait la petite Sadhana. C'est une petite fille nee la-bas. Ses parents, qui vivent maintenant en permanence dans la communaute, aimaient tellement l'endroit qu'ils ont appele leur fille Sadhana. J'ai rarement vu une enfant affichee autant de confiance en elle et d'aisance que celle-ci. C'est entre autre du au format d'education de la communaute, qu'ils appellent ""unschooling"", litteralement ""de-ecoliser"". On nous dit que les enfants n'ont pas besoin d'etre ""de-eduquer"", c'est plutot leur parents... On ne parle pas ici de ne rien enseigner, juste de laisser les enfants nous montrer leurs interets et de faciliter leur apprentissage. Si je me fie a Sadhana, ca donne des resultats magnifiques.

Waaaah... moi qui voulait que ne glisser quelques mots sur la Sadhana Forest avant de parler de mon retour a la Joy Guest House... Alors parlons de mon retour. donc.

Je suis revenu avec mes amies autrichiennes Barbara et Rahel a la Joy guest house. Nan, malheureusement pas de details croustillants a raconte ici non plus, desole de vous decevoir ;p J'ai aussi revu la francaise, Marie, qui m'avait donne tant de precieux conseils et entre autres presentes Goupi, le masseur de la pyramide des corps contents. Elle voit mon air ""batteries a plats"" lors de mon retour et me suggere fortement d'aller revoir Goupi. Excellente idee que je me dis. Je me rends donc a la maison de Goupi pour prendre un rendez-vous avec lui... et je passe deux heures trente a discuter avec lui ou juste a profiter de son jardin et de l'air paisible qui y regne alors qu'il discute avec d'autres personnes. Cet homme est franchement extraordinaire. Lui parler nous amene deja a etre beaucoup plus conscient de qui nous sommes vraiment et surtout A SE PRENDRE BEAUCOUP MOINS AU SERIEUX (je mets les majuscules surtout pour moi-meme 😉) Il me parle des ecureils, qui font du Buddha dans le jardin leur salle a manger, il me parle de ces oiseaux avec qui ils discutent en sifflant ""Auroville"" (il me montre l'exemple). Tout le long, il est sourriant et il a le regard emerveille. Il me montre des photos de cette communaute lors de ses debuts, il y a de cela pres de 40 ans. Comme le reste, c'etait desert, puis la nature a grandit ""ouaaaaahhh"" qu'il ajoute en disant ceci. Puis la nature a fait des siennes avec le cyclone l'an dernier, un des arbre s'est ecroule sur ""la pyramide des corps contents"" et en a troue le toit. Il me dit tout ca en riant comme si de rien n'etait. Cote dedramatisation, c'est le maitre absolu.

Je pourrais en dire long sur ce cher Goupi, mais la je veux aussi vous parler des ti-poissons. Comme c'est notre derniere semaine a Auroville, on veut en profiter un peu. Alors, moi, Barbara, Rahel et d'autres amis allemands (ouais, parce que ces Autrichiennes parlent allemand...) nous nous rendons a un endroit ou il y a un petit bassin rempli de poisson. Quand on y trempe les pieds, les poissons se ruent vers nous et machent comme ils peuvent la peau morte sur nos pieds, nos orteils, et le petit bout de jambe. Ce sont normalement les plus petits poissons qui se jettent sur les jambes, ils sont de la grosseur de menes. Les plus gros, disons gros comme des petites perchaudes, preferent nos pieds directement. Plus de bouffe pour eux je suppose. Le plus dur, au depart, et de ne pas rire parce que c'est une drole de sensation, ca chatouille un peu quoi! Puis, on relaxe et on se laisse aller a ce petit massage. Nous y sommes reste une heure je crois. Hummmm... lorsque l'on est sorti, nos pieds etaient tres propres, plus propres qu'ils n'ont jamais ete depuis mon arriver en Inde. En plus, on se sentait un peu bizarre de marcher sur ses pieds apres ce long massage... La sensation etait tellement transcendante que j'en ai oublie mon sac avec mon passeport a l'interieur. Moi qui ait deja perdu mon appareil photo et une cle USB, j'ai un peu panique quand je m'en suis rendu compte plus loin dans un ""cafe internet"". Je suis revenu, en panique, sur mon velo (fourni par la guest house), sous le soleil chaud. Heureusement, tout etait encore present! Ouf!!!! Tiens, je vais peut etre retourne nourrir ses poissons de ma corne de pieds avant le depart... experience tres relaxante!

Pour le reste, ben ayant epuise mes ressources financieres, n'ayant trouve aucune motivation pour tenter de travailler ou m'etablir ici, j'ai finit par choisir, plus ou moins a contre-coeur a depart, de revenir au Quebec. Mon pere, envers qui je suis infiniment reconnaissant, m'offre de payer mon billet d'avion pour le retour et de m'heberger pour un court moment. Je suis a la fois triste que cet incroyable aventure se termine bientot et heureux de retrouver ma famille et mes amis. Vous me manquez tous!!! J'ai bien hate de vous revoir!!!

J'ajouterez peut-etre un dernier petit mot avant mon retour. Le depart est prevu pour vendredi le 14 septembre a 17h00 quelques et mon arrivee a Montreal pour le samedi 15 septembre a 9h04... Je devrais etre en Beauce pour plus ou moins deux semaines et a Montreal ensuite. Je vous dis donc tous a bientot!!!

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Rameswaram
September 11th 2012
Published: September 11th 2012


This is my first post on Travel blog. And I would like to start it on a religious note, so I am writing my personal experience and feedback on my trip to Rameswaram which is one of the Char Dham place, also one of the twelve Jyotirlings, also known as Varanasi of south.

Aug 31 , 2012
We have started our journey to Rameswaram from Chennai. After finishing our official work we plan to catch the night train which has two benefits for us. First No early rushing from office to catch evening 1700 hrs train and secondly to get chance to see an Engineering Marvel the longest Pamban bridge in the day time. So we catched the train (Rameswaram Express Train number 16701) at 2140 hrs from Chennai Egmore station. The train route was from Chennai to Cuddalore to Thanjavur to Trichy to Karaikkudi to Ramnathapuram to Rameswaram. So I was even more excited that I am going down south and will get a chance to see all these stations.

September 1 , 2012
So In the curiosity of seeing down south stations I woke up at 0500 hrs and was looking out of the train . Trichy came,then Chettinad (This name is also famous for its cuisine), then Karaikkudi (A chain of Restaurants in Chennai). Beautiful green lands, so many coconut trees etc etc. We reached Ramanathapuram at 1000 hrs (15 minutes delayed from schedule arrival time). And I was anxiously waiting for Mandapam station to come so that I can see the longest railway bridge. The Mandapam station came at 1030 hrs and after some time the great big bridge started. Wow, an awesome experience, Sea water was so crystal clear and it was actually flowing. The train bridge is at low level compared to Road bridge so you can actually feel the closeness of sea water and Train. The train has taken approximately 12-13 min to cross the 2 or 2.3 Km bridge. Being a civil Engineer I know the importance of Cantilever bridge plus it is an openable type bridge. Also it was constructed or was opened to traffic long back in the year 1914 (when even no one has thought of Bandra Worli sea link which has now become the longest sea bridge).(See Pic 1)



Then at around 1145 hrs we reached Rameswaram.The train was very long and our coach was at the rear end . As soon as we came out of our AC coach the hot and sunny weather has welcomed us at the Rameswaram. We did not have idea of how much Auto person will charge but knows that Station and temple is not too far (Approx. around 1- 1.2 Km). As we were new the Auto person charged us Rs 60/-As regards to accommodation we were advised by my uncle to visit a Dharamshala which was close to East gate of the temple and has a very good view of sea (See Pic 2). So we preferred to go directly to that Dharamshala and luckily we got the room at second floor. This dharamshala is managed by Bajarang das bapa seva trust (Phone no. 04573-221021). There are 16 rooms in that Dharamshala and most of the time it is occupied by a group booking. When we were there a large group of families (Approx. 100-125 members) were using that dharamshala and we were the fortunate one who got the last room. The room was ok ok not so good in terms of housekeeping or maintenance but what good was in the room was clean Toilet and bathroom and clean bedsheets and Pillowcover. There were 04 beds in each room. I think they allot the rooms to the family or to the group and not to the individual (Jyada log to room milne ke chances jyada). As soon as we have completed our registration formalities the Dharamshala staff has offered us to take Lunch which was going on and was I think is included in the room cost.There was a big dinning room at the ground floor of the building and food was served on a Pangat basis (Sitting on a floor in a row). The food was tasty but the utensils was not so clean as the users has to wash their own utensil so if you are washing it properly , the next person who will be using your utensil is fortunate or vice versa.

After having our Lunch we plan to go for Darshan at 1500 hrs as Temple closes between 1300 - 1500 hrs. We had lots of confusion about what to wear , what to not, ladies has to take bath in the Kunds or not etc etc.We had asked the dharamshala staff and they said no rules and regulation regarding clothes , but wear which is comfortable as you have to take bath in sea and then walk down to temple to take holy bath at 22 Kunds. Also you are not allowed to go inside the temple with wet clothes for Darshan so either you can carry clothes for changing or come back to dharamshala, change the clothes and then go to the temple. So we went to sea (Also known as Agnee Teertham) which was very close to our room at 1445 hrs. Took bath in the sea water. It says that this sea has surrendered to Lord Rama thats why it is very calm sea, there are no low and high tides comes in this sea where devotees take bath. The water was clear but not clean at the banks. If you go little inside then it is ok. Also it makes you difficult to walk inside the sea due to stones underneath. I strongly feel either the Govt or the temple trust should make the arrangement to clean the ends of this sea at Agnee Teerthem.
<dl id=""attachment_69484"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 650px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dd class=""wp-caption-dd"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px;"">AGNEE TEERTHAM</dd></dl>

After taking bath at Sea, we went directly to temple with our wet clothes. At the temple you have to purchase Rs 25/- tickets for taking holy bath at 22 Kunds/ Teerthams.But There were very few people who were buying this tickets as there were many in between guides who were charging Rs 50/- per person to take you around all the Kunds and their attender will pour water on you. So for 3 person we paid Rs 225/- ( No charges taken for my 04 year kid) to this guide for Kund holy bath. With the guides attender we had to rush fast along with group and his attender was taking us around all the kunds. He was carrying a small bucket with a rope. Every Kund he was pouring a bucket of kund water on each of us. It was a kind of fun as well as a very good experience. Some Kund has sweet water, some kund has cold water and some has hot water even though the Kunds were adjacent to each other. So after finishing 22 Kund (21 Kunds and the last one is sort of Ganga jal which they pour using small kalash). Once we are done with Kunds we had two option , one we can go back to our room and change the clothes and then come for Darshan and second we can change the clothes at the temple itself and do the Darshan. There are ladies changing area available (one side covered by Aluminium partition and one side by cloth). So after changing clothes we went inside the temple and had a very good Darshan. I realised one thing which I am actually not very sure but if you start your Darshan sharp at 1500 hrs (i.e Kund holy bath and then Darshan) then you can have better darshan as more crowd enters only after 1600 hrs.So better reach early in the afternoon and have very nice and quick Darshan.

After Darshan we returned to our room and planned to go around the temple.At around 1800 hrs we decided to go around for tea/ coffee and some snacks. Unfortunately when we went around we could not find any restaurant where we can get something to eat as all were preparing for Dinner. Generally around 1900 hrs Dinners are available at all the restaurant. We have taken route from East side to South side and then to West side. One important thing is that there are number of Lodges and Dharamshala at East and South side.And in Rameswaram you will not face any problem with the language as everyone speak Hindi, English and Tamil.I am just writing down few dharamshalas and lodges phone numbers from where I had collected their cards.As when I was researching on Accommodation part I was not getting any dharamshala and lodges phone number on the internet with very economical charges and we went without booking any room inadvance which could be quite risky when you are going with old people and kids.a) Agrasen Bhawan (Phone no. 04573-221514,221614) b) Bangur Dharamshala (Phone no. 04573- 223168) c) Gujarat Bhavan (Phone no. 04573-221301) . There are many other lodges like Sahukar wala bhawan , Palani Lodge, Kumaran lodge , many rest houses etc.So when we were searching for restaurant we landed up at Ananda Bhavan Restaurant . It is on the west side and serves very nice coffee ( Rs. 10/-)and south indian snacks (Approx. Rs 30/- to Rs 50/- each ) and that too not very expensive . One thing one should note that in general case I do not think there will be any problem as regards to room and food near temple. And it is advisable to take room either on East side or on South side. As regards to food there are number of restaurants that serves marwadi or north Indian food. It actually sometimes become quite confusing which Restaurant we should go for. By 2030 hrs we decided to enter in the restaurant where we will get maximum crowd.So we entered at Siva Shakti Bhojnalaya (Phone no 09944263915). They serve only meals (Pure vegetarian). And the cost of each meal is Rs 60/- which I think is quite economical. They serve Dal+ 2 Veg+ salad+papad+ rice + chapatti.It was nice , clean ,tasty and hygienic food . Also one should note that in Rameswaram generally Dinner time gets over by 2030 hrs so if you are planning to have dinner ensure you reach at the Bhojanalaya little early else you will miss out on some part of meals.
September 2, 2012
We decided to go for Sphatiklinga (Crystal Quartz Shivlinga) Darshan. It is a rare pooja which Temple organises only early morning between 0500- 0600 hrs and tickets can be purchased from the special counter at 0430 hrs onwards. We reached Temple at 0500 hrs and there were already 200-300 more devotees were in a queue . The special ticket cost is Rs 50/- per person.After standing in a queue for almost 15-20 minutes the queue started moving . At one particular point few people were entering from other side and merging into the queue. This leads to some arguments between regular queue people and Temple staff. This type of scene is quite disappointing. There should be proper rules and regulation as regards to Darshan, as there were several devotees who have even came at 0400 hrs just to have quick and nice darshan. This Darshan was very fast and you were not allowed to see sphatik Shivlinga darshan for more than even few seconds. Also this shivlinga is very small and you have to figure out very minutely where exactly is the Shivlinga as it is surrounded by all deepams.So we finished our Darshan at around 0615 hrs and were back in room by 0630 hrs. On the same way back as well as on other streets there are restaurants which serve good south indian as well as north Indian breakfast.
As we had to leave the room at 1200 hrs we decided to go early for sight seeing. Please note that in Rameswaram generally the checkout time is just 23 hrs. They will charge the next day charges even if you are staying for just 2- 3 hours extra.For sight seeing there are Autos available who will take you around to all the sight seeing places. They will charge you 300/- for Local rounds and if you wish to go to Dhanushkodi they will charge Rs 200/- extra upto mini truck stand.So we hired an auto for sight seeing at 0700 hrs. Generally for sight seeing Auto starts at 0700 hrs. And actually its good if you are visiting those places early morning otherwise scorching heat will not let you enjoy.In the sight seeing they cover 10 points:
a) Vibhishan Temple – It is the temple where Lord Sri Ram did abhishekam of Demon King brother Vibhishan.The old temple was destroyed in 1964 cyclone and in the same place new temple is constructed . This temple is approx. 09 Km from the Main temple. We had finished this temple Darshan by 0730 hrs.
<dl id=""attachment_69482"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 650px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dd class=""wp-caption-dd"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px;"">VIBHISHAN TEMPLE</dd></dl>

b) Dhanushkodi – It is a place where you can see confluence of Indian ocean and Bay of Bengal. Infact this village was also destroyed in 1964 cyclone and not you can see just a traces of villages buildings. When we went to Dhanushkodi, there were very few people around (just 7-8 ), so we decided not to go further as it doesn’t seems to be safe for us.For Dhanushkodi , one can refer Google on Rameswaram Dhanushkodi. The sea here was not calm as the sea at Agnee Teertham. Very nice place, worth to go. Beach is clean, crystal clear water. It would be good place to enjoy if you are in a group and get a chance to see Beaches very rarely.Frankly speaking in all those 10 sight seeing point I find only this place to be worth watching.It is again 07-08 Kms away from Vibhishan temple i.e approx 18 Km from main temple.

c) Ram Jharokha & Sakshi Hanuman temple : So we were back again inside the Rameswaram town. It is the temple where they say Lord Rama rested here and his footprints temple is this temple. Good temple, calm and peaceful place. You can watch Doordarshan tower from here.

f) Laxman Teertham/Kund and Laxman Temple– It is again old structure and temple is now under renovation.
<dl id=""attachment_69490"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 370px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dd class=""wp-caption-dd"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px;"">LAXMAN TEERTHAM/KUND</dd></dl>

g) Seetha Kund and Panchmukhi Hanuman temple & Floating stone– Seetha Kund is again destroyed .Panchmukhi Hanuman temple is still in a construction stage. In the same temple you will find floating stones which temple people say are the stones used for making Ram sethu during Ramayana time.
<dl id=""attachment_69489"" class=""wp-caption aligncenter"" style=""width: 370px;""><dt class=""wp-caption-dt""></dt><dd class=""wp-caption-dd"" style=""font-size: 11px; line-height: 17px; padding: 0px 4px 5px; margin: 0px;"">PANCHMUKHI HANUMAN</dd></dl>

This finishes our sight seeing and Auto person has dropped us back to the Dharamshala at 0900 hrs. So if you have planned to see sight seeing point you should spare 02 hrs for it.
At 1200 noon we had left the room. The dharamshala staff did us a favour by keeping our luggage without charge . So we all then moved to take Lunch. We decided to take Lunch this time at Gujrat Bhojnalaya (Phone no. 04573-221159) as it was just next to our Dharamshala . There were two types of Lunch available, one is regular veg meal (Rs 60/-) and other is special veg meal(Rs 100/-) . As we did not have our breakfast we decided to take Special Lunch. The regular veg meal has dal, one veg and Chapati and in Special meal they serve dal, 3 veg, kadi, curd, butter milk, salad, papad, pickle, sweet, rice and chapati . And the main thing of their food is it is just like home food and the lady who administers this lunch will say you twice thrice that please have full lunch (“ Pet bhar ke khane ka and the same in Gujrati too ). And I must say please do not miss on this lunch. Once in your trip one should go to Gujrat Bhojnalaya and have food.They also pack food for you for train if you give them order in advance. So we had also asked them to pack food for train i.e Methi Paratha (10/- each) and Pickle .The lunch timing for this bhojnalaya is 1230 hrs – 1430 hrs.
Thus after having lunch we went out and looking for place where we can spend our 02 hrs as we had train at 1700 hrs. So we decided to take a boat ride. The boat ride was available near to Agnee Teertham. Tamilnadu Tourism Hotel is also one place to stay and it is just opposite to Ferry boarding point. One can book room online as well .What I can see from outside is that the Hotel looks good and clean but little distance away from temple. I think the room rent starts here fromRs 800/- onwards.The boat ride charges for each person is Rs 60/- and they take you for half an hour ride (See Pic 15 ) .After having such a heavy lunch it was so relaxing to be in that boat ride . The half an hour ride was really good .The timings for this boat ride is 0600 – 1800 hrs.The boat ride is a big boat which can carry almost 30-50 people.

This finishes our trip to Rameswaram. We had collected our train food parcel and took an auto for station. This time I negotiated with them and the Auto person agreed to take us back to station in Rs 40/- (That menas when we were coming from station we paid 20/- more). The station is good, again clean , with chairs for sitting facility, long platform. The station has many shops e.g food/meal/tiffin , Aavin Milk shop (For flavoured milk, buttermilk etc) , sea shell shops, coffee outlet etc.

We were back in our AC train leaving the heat of Rameswaram outside and just cherishing the memories and Darshan….
Must Watch :
a) Rameswaram Ramanathswamy Temple
b) Agnee Teertham and 22 holy bath Kunds
c) Dhanushkodi
d) Ferry ride
e) Gujrati Bhojnalaya
Don’t :
a) Do not carry too many plastic bags, bottles as Rameswaram is “no plastic zone”

September 10th 2012
Published: September 10th 2012


Waaaaaa,

Le temps file,

J'ai passe un deux semaines a la Sadhana Forest, unecommunaute un peu en retrait d'Auroville. La-bas, y'avait pas un acces facile a internet, voila pourquoi j'ai mi tant de temps a re-ecrire dans ce blogue. Quand j'en avais la chance, j'ecrivais ou je repondais personnellement a certains d'entres vous.

Voila pour la justification 😉

Alors maintenant, parlons de la Sadhana Forest.

Sadhana, ca veut dire qqc comme ""chmein spirituel"" ou ""objectif spirituel"" C'est cute, non? Bon ben c'est ca qui est ca. Ceux qui ont fonde la Sadhana Forest en ontfait leur Sadhana, c'est-a-dire que leur mission principale a eux, c'est la reforestation de cet endroit qui etait desert il y a seulement 8 ans. Vous tomberiez sur le derriere si je vous montrais les photos, mais j'ai perdu mon appareil recemment. J'avais quelque photos sur ma cle USB, mais je crois que celle-ci a aussi disparu, faut croire que je passe un peu trop de temps dans la lune plutot qu'en Inde, je sais pas trop.

Bref, j'etais a la Sadhana Forest, pis la bas, y plante des arbres. Mais y font pas que planter de arbres. En fait, 80% du travail de reforestation consiste plutot dans la conservation de l'eau. Ben oui, pas d'eau, pas d'arbres. Comme la terre etait plutot sec, l'eau ne restait pas, et tous les nutriments sur le sol etait ausitot ""lave"" vers la mer. Alors ils contruisent des sortes de barrages fait de terre, avec des trous devant ou derriere. Il faut que ces barrages soient bien fait, sinon ca devient dangeureux. Voyez-vous, ce sont des especes de bosses, de longues murailles arrondies. L'une d'elle n'etait pas arrondie, elle etait plate, et derriere, beaucoup d'au s'accumule. Par contre, comme elle est plate, et meme un peu renfonce, l'eau rentre aussi dans la muraille, ce qui l'affaiblie rapidement et, lorsque la mouson viendra, si rien n'est fait, la muraille va ceder et la communaute va etre innonde. Faque, parmi nos taches, nous devions refaire, ou du moins parfaire, cette muraille.

Ce travail est fait manuellement, on a de longue tige de metale dont le bout est semblable a un tournevis plat, mais en plus gros et pas mal plus lourd. Avec ca, on casse la terre, comme avec un pic sauf qu'on reste debout. Puis, on ramasse la terre pour la mettre dans des grands bols. L'outil pour ramasser la terre se nomme ""mumpti"", c'est comme une pelle mais renverse vers soi, dont le manche est si petit que l'on doive se pencher dans un angle de 90 degre pour s'en servir. Plusieurs disent que c'est moins difficile a utiliser qu'une vrai pelle en fait, avis aux interesses pour l'hiver prochain 😉

Ca, c'est l'un des travails que j'ai fait a la Sadhana Forest, sous une temperature ressentie en moyenne de 40 degre celsius puique l'on travaillait le matin. Il avait d'autre travaux en foret qui consitait a ramaser des feuilles et des restants de toits pour les mettres autour de buttes dans lequels des arbres etaient plantes. Les restants de toits ont fait de feuilles de palmiers, et il y en a beaucoup a utilier car Auroville a ete frappe par un cyclone destructeur en hiver dernier. Mais les dommages, heureusements, sont surtout des arbres et des toits... Quoique l'infrastructure en general a ete ausi durement touche, comme l'electricite et l'eau, mais ce cote la est bien retabli maintenant Pis la raison pourquoi on met des feuiles mortes et des restants de toits autour des arbres naissants, c'est pour empecher les mauvaises herbres ou les eucalyptus, des arbres tres gourmands, de pousser autour des ti-bebes arbres ou arbres en devenir. De plus, ces bouts de toits attire des termites, qui vont les bouffer et les transformer en bons nutriments pour l'arbre en question. Pas de danger, les termites mangent le bois mort, pas le vivant, alors les arbres n'ont rien a craindre. Enfin, rien a craindre des termites.

Bon, c'est vrai que je travaillais fort, mais cette parti du travail avait lieu de 6 heures a 8 heures le matin. On avait une bonne pause et y'avait pas de pression. Heureusement parce que sous cette chaleur, on depense rapidement de l'energie. Ca, c'etait l'horraire du premier ""Seva"". ""Seva"" c'est un mot sanscrit qui veut dire ""Service"". Le deuxieme ""Seva"" avait lieu apres dejeuner, de 9h00 a 11h25 et pouvait consiste en plusieurs choses. Parmi les taches que j'ai effectues, il y avait remplir les differents seaux d'eau pour les toilettes et le lavage de main. Ca l'air facile comme ca mais ca voulait dire charier un mega gros boyau d'arrosage a travers la communaute. Ah? pourquoi rempli l'eau des toilettes? Je vous explique :

A la Sadhana Forest, on recupere tout et on tente de gaspiller le moins possible. On chie dans des barils qui sont places dans un trou, dans le sol. Donc on s'installe bien accroupi au-dessus de ces barils, on fait ce que l'on a a faire et puis on recouvre ensuite notre oeuvre d'au moins deux tases de brin de scie. Puis on se place le derriere au-dessus de la toilette turque, on prends de la main droite la tasse d'eau que l'on a prepare au prealable, et on verse l'eau sur notre main gauche avec laquelle on nettoie allegrement notre joli derriere. L'eau de chaque toilette est dans une marmitte geante en metal qui est recouverte d'une assiette aussi en metal. Dans chacune de ces marmittes, il y a ausi des branches de ""neem"", un arbre dont les branches et les feuilles ont des proprietes desinfectantes. Dans cette communaute, c'est aussi avec de la poudre de neem que l'on e broses les dents. Les plus braves utilisent meme directement la branche de l'arbre que l'on effiloche legerement. Mais bon, retour a la toilette. Vous vous en doutez bien, il faut se laver les mains rendu la. Ben on se rend a une ""station de lavage"", compose de l'une de ces grandes marmittes, d'une bouteille de savon et de deux tasses en metal. L'une pour remplir d'eau et verser dans la seconde qui elle, est fixe et perce d'un ou trois trous. Voila! Nous avons un jet d'eau et tres peu de gaspillage!!!

Voila pourquoi on a besoin de remplir de l'eau. Comme je viens de parler du sujet qui fascine le plus les gens, je continue dans la meme veine. Lors de la deuxieme Seva, j'ai ausi fait parti de l'equipe d'hygiene. Hmmmmmmmm.... En fait, tout ce que je decris parais pire que c'est, lorsqu'on le fait, c'est pas si pire. Donc l'hygiene que je disais. On doit d'abord melanger la merdre deux fois par jour. Meuh oui, on melange la merdre pour etre sur que le compostage se fera bien. Donc, a l'aide d'une grande tige ou d'un long baton de bambou, on brasse la merde pour au moins quatre minute matin et soir. Le reste c'est du nettoyage, a l'aide de l'eau, de vinaigre ou d'ammoniac et de squeegee. Mais non, j'oubliais le plus important! Charier les barils de fumiers! Lorsque les barils sont plein, on les sort du trou, on les couvre et on les remplace. Pour servir, ce fumier doit macerer quelques mois. Quand les barils sont prets, on les charient et on les vide sur le tas de fumier, en grimpant le tas de fumier, brulant, pieds nus. Certaines toilettes ne sont pas des baril par contre, ce ne sont que des trou. Alor, on prend une tige de metal muni d'une petite boite, un peu comme ces portes-dechets au bout d'un manche que certains employes de restaurants ou autres lieux publics utilisent. C'est plus ou moins notre pelle a merde. Alor on ce sert de ceci pour vider le trou et emplir des chaudieres que l'on ira egalement porte sur le tas de fumier. A la fin de l'exercice, on est generalement couvert de fumier de la tete au pied. Mais ce n'est pas si degueulase, le pire, je le repete, c'est la chaleur.

Quoi d'autres, ben c'est pas mal ca. Le reste, c'est la cuisine et le lavage de vaisselle ou encore le nettoyage de la hutte principale. Ca aussi c'est beaucoup de travail. Imaginez que l'on fasse toujours ce boulot pour une vingtaine de personnes. Oui, 20, on nous dit qu'il n'y a pas grand monde en ce moment... Alors voila. Ici, on mange vegetalien pour plein de raisons. Entre autres, parce que les animaux que l'on mange sont responsables en grande partie de la deforestation de la planete, alors on nous dit ""pourquoi faire de la reforestation avec nos mains si on fait de la deforestations avec notre bouche??"" Comment ca on fait de la deforestation avec notre bouche? Ben, demandez a n'importe quel cultivateur, combien de terres ca prends pour nourrir une vache? La reponse? Je l'ignore, mais je sais que ca en prends 8 fois plus que pour nourrir un homme et qu'en se moment, le 2 tiers des terres arables de la planete servent a nourrir les animaux qu'on bouffe alors qu'un tier du monde creve de faim. Alors voila pourquoi on mange vegetalien a la Sadhana forest. Bon, ceci etant dit, maintenant que je n'y suis plus, je me suis gave de fromage et d'omelette et rien ne garanti que je ne mangerai pas un bon gros hamburger juteux un de ces quatres a Montreal, mais je trouve tout de meme ces faits interessants et je respecte enoremement ceux qui sont vegetaliens, je les respectent moins quand ils veulent me forcer a le devenir alors je partage seulement les faits que je trouve interessant, vous en faites ce que vous voulez, moi-meme, je ne suis pas vegetalien et ne crois pas le devenir. Je serai juste plus conscient... Enfin, bref, on mange vegetalien a la Sadhana Forest.

Donc, on mange ben des legumes pis pour une raison X, les indiens aiment bien couper les legumes ""small small"" (petit petit) Alors on a ben du travail dans la cuisine. Alors que les ""Seva"" finissent souvent a 11h25,il arrive que ceux qui travaillent a la cuisine pour preparer le diner terminent plutot a 12h25. Pis la je ne vous parle pas du vendredi soir, ou on invite les gens a venir bouffergratuitement apres un film. Quand je participais a la preparation de ce repas, nous avons eu 60 visiteurs au moins. C'etait quelque chose comme on dit chenous.

Oui, bon, parce que en dehors des SEVA on doit faire quelques autres services a la communaute, qui sont parfois le soir. La cuisine est l'un d'entre eux. Parfois, on travail au-dessus du feu a brasser de la soupe ou autres. C'est assez difficile ce bout la. Moi, ce que je preferais, c'est quand on faisait des Dosa ou des Chapatis, qui sont des sortes de crepes pour les dosas ou des pains tortillas pour les chapatis. J'aimais bien parce que le feu se trouve sous une grande plaque et qu'il y a un tuyau pour evacuer la fumee a l'exterieur plutot que dans nos yeux. Alors mon boulot etait d'etendre le melange a divers endroits sur la plaque et les retourner lorsque c'est pret. Fouillez-moi pourquoi, on etait plusieurs a aimer cette partie du boulot.

Quand nous n'avons pas de ""service a la communaute"" a faire et bien nous sommes libres des 11h25, soit juste avant le diner. Il y a souvent des atelers organises par les volontaires en apres-midi ou en soiree. Ca peut etre variable selon les talents et experiences des volontaires presents. J'ai participe a des ateliers de Capoiera, yoga, ""lecture de l'oeil"" (puissant et etrange, je vous raconterai un autre tantot...), theatre et c'est pas mal ca. L'atelier de theatre etait donne par un jeune francais de dix sept ans du nom de Luca, mais je lui donnait beaucoup plus que ca car ce jeune homme etait tres mature. Travaillant, joyeux et confiant en lui. Il semblait tres experimente quand il nous dirigeait durant son atelier. C'est une des nombreuses belles rencontres que j'ai fait a la Sadhana forest.

Waaa, j'en aurais tellement a raconte. Entre autre sur notre reveil. Chaque jour de la semaine, des volontaires sont charges de nous reveiller avec une chanson, differente chaque jour. Les premiers jours, Luca faisait parti de l'equipe de reveil et il y prenait un plaisir contagieux. Ces chansons etaient toujours joyeuses et bien sur, on la gardait en tete pour toute la journee. La derniere semaine, il y avait entre autres un gars des etats unis qui faisait partie de l'equipe. Le gars ressemble a l'image que l'on a de jesus dans la vingtaine, avec des yeux bleus. Il chante super bien et joue de la guitare. Un soir, il se dit que se serait bien de nous reveiller avec des chansons plus smooth. Alors il amene sa guitare et, accompagne de quelques volontaires dont moi, chante ""Alleluia"" de Leonard Cohen. C'etait un des reveils magique. Les autres matins, il a chante d'autres jolies chansons de groupe moins connus (vous connaissez fleet foxes??) et il nous a servi ""get back"" des beattles (je crois que ca s'appelle get back, que les fans me pardonnent...)

Apres la chanson du matin, on se reunit en cercle. Mais d'abord, ceux charges du reveil doivent sonner une cloche pour nous signaler que c'est l'heure du cercle. Lorsque j'y etais, une dame vivait a la Sadhana Forest avec ses 4 chiens. Ceux-ci aimaient bien participer a ce dernier appel pour le cercle. Chaque matin, on les sentait febrile, se reunissant avant nous, la queues qui trahissaient leur joie. Puis, des les premiers sons de cloches, ils hurlaient le plus fort qu'ils pouvaient. C'etait tres drole a voir. Une fois en cerlce, on fait des etirements, ou des massages pour se reveiller, on chante souvent une chanson puis on se distribue les taches pour la journee. Ouais, ca fait colonnie de vacance mais ca demarre bien la journee.

Je vous reparlerai peut-etre prochainement de ces belles rencontres a la Sadhana Forest, ou du pourquoi je ne suis pas demeurre plus de deux semaines (genre les moins beaux cotes ou les cotes qui me convenaient moins) ou encore de mon retour a la Joy Guest House, des poissons qui nettoient les pieds ou de l'angoisse existentielle qui m'a ronge avant d'enfin decider que je revenais au Quebec. Mais pour l'instant c'est assez d'ecriture pour moi. Je suis content de reprendre contact avec vous tous et de recommencer a partagez ces beaux moments avec vous. Si vous voulez voir des photos de cette communaute, n'hesitez pas a visiter leur site web au http://sadhanaforest.org/

A bientot!!!

Brihadeeswarar 1
the gopuram, main entrance
Standing right in front of the Great Temple of the Empire Chola, I could see this is very old; it has the rustic ancient architectural design, high walls on both sides, with the only huge high entrance I know just below the Gopuram. The Gopuram has got nine layers of magnificent carvings of Great Gods of Hindus. This temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva, The Destroyer. This temple is named Brihadeeswarar Temple or is also known as Rajarajeswaram Temple, The Imperial Chola Temple built by Raja Raja Chola I in the 11th century, 1010 CE. It is situated on the south end of the Kaveri River in Tamil Nadu.

It was the Vijayalaya (850-871 CE) who had defeated the Pallavas, Pandyas and the Muttaraiyas that paved the way for the Cholas to rule this Uraiyur region. The Great Chola held major parts of Sri Lanka and the South India, their presence over the North India that stretches all the way to South East Asia.

Mr. Ganesh from Singapore had a holiday in India, visiting his brother-in-law who resides in Thanjavur, approached me (the only Chinese in this temple) with knowledge to share. He said the Great Chola or the
Brihadeeswarar 2
entrance into main temple
Great Cholan has his kingdom all the way to Singapore. The Raja Raja Chola’s son(Raja Rajendra I) resided in Singapore refused to come back until his father was taken ill, his father summoned his solders to bring back his son to India. Later his son built another Chola Empire not far from his fathers’ land, a replica of Brihadeeswarar.

From my knowledge, Bay of Bengal is also known as Lake Chola. In Kuala Lumpur, we have a road name after the Cholas, it is Jalan Raja Chulan (Raja Chulan Road). According to Mr. Ganesh, many of Raja Rajendra I descendants are in Singapore and Malaysia with the surname of Chola or Cholan that I have yet to meet them. In his conquests, he has colonized Burma, Andaman and Nicobar Island, Maldives and the Kingdom of Srivijaya, Palembang in Sumatra, Java and the Malay Peninsula. So this is true after all, the Malay Archipelago was once a Hindu colonization. Bali is one good example to reckon with.

[The use of the term ""Melayu"" and its other spelling variants can be traced back to the beginning of Common Era. Among its earliest appearance was in
Brihadeeswarar 3
small vendor beneath the gopuram
Vayu Purana where the word ""Malayadvipa"" (literally ""insluar mountain continent"") was mentioned, referring to the mountainous terrain of Malay Peninsula. Then, the term ""Maleu-Kolon"" was used in Geographia by Ptolemy which is believed to have originated from the Sanskrit term malayakolam or malaikurram, referring to a geographical part of Malay Peninsula. In 7th century, the first use of the term for a nation or a kingdom was recorded by I Ching. An inscription on the south wall of the 11th century Brihadeeswarar Temple also made a reference to Malaiyur, a kingdom that had ""a strong mountain for its rampart"" in Malay Peninsula that fell to the Chola invaders during Rajendra Chola I's campaign.]-Wikipedia, The Melayu Kingdom

In the Brihadeeswarar, there are few shrines built around the main temple. There is a Nandi shrine, 6m in length, 3m in height, weighs 25 tons. It was carved from one single rock. Nandi is the black bull. I was told he is the teacher to Lord Shiva. There are shrines like Lord Ganesha, Lord Subramaniam, Amman and the Karuvur Deva, The Royal Priest. The main shrine is the main attraction; it contained the biggest Lingam in India. The temple tower is 60m
Brihadeeswarar 4
elephant ride
in height, considering the tallest temple in India and maybe the world. It has an eighty one ton Dome on the top of the tower. One wonders how on earth they could lift the dome to the top.

I walked round the temple, I saw many Lingams along the hallway and the paintings on the walls were exquisite. There 250 Lingams all the way, each has its own meaning, referring to their elements of the universe. There are 108 statues in 108 dances of Bharathanatyam Yajna, enacted by classical dance of Tamils. Each statue has different style of postures and hand mudras. A classical story told in these dances. What amazed me were the inscriptions in Tamil inscribed on most walls. This Tamil inscription is said to be the oldest language in the world. I have wondered, does the 21st century Indians know how to read these ancient Tamil inscriptions? How different compared to the Tamil words in modern time today? How many years have these artisans inscribed on these walls? I was told it has the story of the great achievements of the Raja. This is his pride and joy inscribed for the people to read.

This
Brihadeeswarar 5
the wall inscriptions in old tamil
Great Living Chola Temple was nominated as the UNESCO World Heritage in 1987. They celebrated grandly in year 2010 to commemorate 1000 years history. Though it has been 1100 years ago, this Brihadeeswarar Temple still stood mighty in its own charming way, the era of the once great kingdom owned by a great Raja with rich history that certainly will have many people come to see and to read about.

Thanks to Mr. Ganesh who has made this story possible for me to do my research further on the story of Raja Rajendra Chola in South East Asia. I was happy to have met someone close to home and became friends from that point onwards. I hope we will meet again, same place? Hopefully YES.

palani 1
the main shrine of lord murugan
Whenever I have an assignment bringing tourist to Batu Caves, I tried to elaborate more when I gave commentaries on Hinduism and Batu Caves as a whole story which gives me pleasure to do so. After I have learnt from tourism school , my own research from the internet, visited Batu Caves frequently to ask around the Indians about Batu Caves and Hinduism which somehow has thicken my knowledge and making my story more interesting when I gave my commentary. There is this part about Lord Shiva and his wife Parvati decided to test their two sons, Lord Ganesha (Elephant God) and his younger brother Lord Murugan (The God with his peacock). Lord Shiva held a Golden Mango of Wisdom in his hand and told his sons whoever circles the world and return first to his parents will win this fruit of wisdom. Lord Murugan flew on his peacock, taking his sweet time to return home, knowing well his brother Lord Ganesha can never win. He cannot fly!...because Lord Ganesha’s vehicle is a Moonjoor rat......So for a moment, Lord Ganesha thought, he walked round his parents three times and told his parents, they are his world (self realization can

be attained only with one's vision focused inwards). He won the contest. Lord Murugan came back and was angry that he had lost the contest. He left the family, leaving all his wealth and position and became an Aandhi, a person who has nothing to his name and left for Palani Hill, Coimbatore, Tamil Nadu. This is also the place where Lord Murugan became enlightened when his mother later came to see him and told him of an evil demon that he needs to destroy to save the world. That was the day he became Lord Subramaniam.

My neighbor advised me to places I never heard of. One of them is Palani. It was a long drive from Kochi to Palani, almost two hours. Basically there was nothing much to see from the highway. When we entered into smaller roads, we saw small towns, cows on the streets, many Indians men and women lepak lepak (a Malay word for jay walking), temples built on barren hills, wondering if I could go there but then it will take a lot of time if we chose to climb one of the hills. So I let the idea slipped. Palani

paddy fields and coconut plantations
was a bigger town. Many buildings, from single to four stories the most, hotels and restaurants available. Yup, all serves Indian food, no Italian pizza but Indian ones, The Paratha. Flowers, incense and fruits are the most common necessities to the Indians, for there were so many temples around us. Yet I could not see Palani but only a wall on my left hand side that stretches quite a distance until we reached the cable car. My driver told us there are 3000 steps up if we decide to walk. We just shook our heads, NO! My friends decided not to walk up to Palani and insisted on riding on a cable car, more like a tram to me but the Indians called this differently.

“Oooooooh My God”. We waited for two and the half hours for the tram. There was a lunch break for an hour in between, playing some prayer songs that almost could tear our eardrums apart and these Indians do really have patience waited for so long hours in a six line queue that each queue is about sixty feet in length. There are only two trams that can only fit in less
palani 4
zoom in on paddy fields and coconut plantations
than fifteen passengers and each trip took about fifteen minutes. Let’s do some calculation, fifteen minutes x two ways = thirty minutes. About half an hour before the tram started its operation, I was ushered by three sweet gentle chubby sisters to cut queue to the fifth row. Every grill partitions have an exit for people who want to go to the washroom or to buy food. I came from the washroom. I asked if this is alright to do so. The sisters said it was ok. They knew I am a tourist but my friends were still in the sixth row. But the three gentlemen on the fifth row did like the idea I crossed over to their side. The first guy said to me, “Do you know it is a sin to do this? God will punish you”. I smiled back and replied, “I am a sinner and I am ready for the punishment”. The second guy refused to let me sit on the bench by lifting up his left leg and let rest on the bench in which I do not mind at all. But the third guy, he was kind enough to shift himself backwards to
palani 5
let me sit before him. So it was not too bad after all. At least one person understood and obligingly offered a seat in kindness. Just like the story of the Good Samaritan. Patience, Patience, Patience.
Up on the Palani Hill, I had a wonderful time. The view around Palani was simply great. One side I saw few mountains and green carpet of paddy fields and coconut plantations while on the other side, there is a lake that is surrounded by the town. The people there were friendly, they showed me the way to the shrine of Palani but we were allowed a few seconds to clasp our both palms and mumble his name and a short prayer. I was told there was a Siddha (Bhogarnatha) buried in one of the underground passage unfortunately I could not find him. Many took the steps. I found out it was only 689 steps that only took them about forty five minutes to reach the top. Old folks of sixty to eighty years old managed but why can’t we? A little too late, wasted the two and the half hours…….”shuks! if only I knew…….”

I have heard of a story told by
palani 6
my neighbor that in ancient times, Bhogar made a statue of Lord Murugan with nine herbs and one of them is mercury. He said, in those days, many devotees and monks scraped off the back of the statue and ate them bit by bit for medicinal healing, it seems it healed many illnesses and diseases. The back of the statue became hollow, leaving the visible front, the committee decided to save the statue and hid the statue in a safe place. I hope the next Bhogar will come and make the new one for the world sufferings......soon.

So this is the hill I have always given commentary to tourists in my homeland. I finally came here, felt on top of the world, so close to Lord Murugan if he notice me, a foreigner with T-shirt, short pants, a cap and a snicker that look a lot different from the norm that turned heads, oh my.... came to me asking questions, gave big smiles so warm and friendly that allowed me to make some new friends in just that one hour, so meaningful, always wants me to take photos of them, unfortunately many do not have computer or an email.
palani 7
They were disappointed; it showed on their face expressions but they were kind and understand for that reason yet gave me a friendly smile.

I will go to Palani again, that’s for sure.

Some pointers for tourists when visit India.

1) Remember not to use the cable car in Palani (chuckle)

2) No ice-drinks, No yogurt drinks. No food from side stalls by the five foot path.

3) Hot food and hot drinks are acceptable. Always insist eating at the restaurant.

4) Buy diarrhea pills from India.

5) WC or Washing Machine means Toilet/Washroom/Wash Basin

6) They say “Hotel” for restaurant

7) Foreigners are not allowed to enter most Temples in South India.

8) Walk barefoot and park your shoes/slippers at the shoe shack for a small fee or if you come by car, leave your shoes/slippers in the car.

9) Remember which entrance of the temple you enter. Look out for landmark before entering temples. They have North, South, East, West entrance.

10) No photography allowed on the main shrine and other shrines. Some have to pay a fee for taking in the camera with you.

Have fun.

I have visited Kipling Cafe earlier... the ambience was nice, the food was good, but one could not but notice that the staff had a sort-of high-handed attitude. I brushed it aside, as I could see that many of the tables were occupied by Americans and Europeans and the staff obviously had eyes and service only for them!

A couple of days back, we had guests at home and remembering Kipling, I decided to order home-delivery. We waited embarrassingly for much more than an hour for the food to arrive and when it did, it was cold pizza! The delivery boy and subsequently the manager-on-duty Hari coolly said that the restaurant had been too busy with other orders. When I mentioned that they could have called as I had guests waiting, they seemed to be in a hurry to get their bill settled. And in a matter-of-fact manner, very callously they said they could replace the pizza! And bring back another one in another hour?

They could very well be joking if not for the tense situation.

It was almost 11pm, all other restaurants were closed, I could not return back their order and place a fresh order in another restaurant! I served re-heated food to my guests. I was so upset I told the manager on the phone that I would clear the bill whenever he had the time to come over and try to understand how much he had upset a customer. I wanted to meet this guy and give him a earful about handling customers, being in the service industry and then clear his bill.

Being a food critic, and with several reviews of restaurants to my credit, I got the owners' contact info through friends, and sent her a text that we wanted to talk to her about our experience at her restaurant. And then I did get a call, not from anyone in Kipling, but from the inspector at the local police station. This cop said that Kipling had issued a complaint against me for eating at their restaurant and refusing to pay the bill. Though we were furious, explained the situation clearly to him and he was surprised that this was the issue.

This is where my story ends for now. I wonder if any of you out there have had a similar experience with Kipling. I also wonder if this has become the way of life in Kipling today... getting the local authorities to harass their other customers!

So what was supposed to be a wonderful review of a nicely tucked-away restaurant on East Coast Road, Chennai, serving decent but expensive food, has turned into an ugly review of a shady joint on ECR serving God-knows-what along with food to its customers.

August 17th 2012
Published: August 17th 2012


Les derniers jours ont ete eprouvants et j'ai vecu beaucoup de stress que j'apprends effectivement. La raison en est for simple, mes reserves d'argent s'epuisaient et ils ne me restaient plus que 2000 roupies en tout et partout. 2000 roupies, pour vous donner une idee, c'est environ 40$ canadiens. C'est sur qu'ici, ca mene plus loin que chez nous mais tout de meme, ce n'etait pas enorme. Puis, alors que je faisais seulement exprimer comment je me sentais face a tout ca dans un groupe de communications non-violente ici a Auroville, le monde s'est ouvert... A la fin de la rencontre, la femme qui est responsable de ce groupe et habite a Auroville m'a fait un don de 5000 roupies. Laissez-moi vous donnez une idee de ce que ce dont peut representer pour quelqu'un qui vit a Auroville :

Les Aurovilliens ne gagnent pas vraiment d'argent, ils ont toutefois une sorte de ""pension de subsistance"" de 6000 roupies par mois. Sur 6000 par mois, elle m'en a donne 5000, en me disant que la semaine prochaine, pour la premiere fois de sa vie, elle allait gagner de l'argent en donnant des seminaires dans le Kerala, une autre province de l'Inde. Oui, elle allait gagne de l'argent pour la premiere fois de sa vie car elle est ne a Auroville. Elle gagne se prepare a gagner de l'argent pour la premiere fois de sa vie et le partage avec moi. J'etais extremement touche.Elle expliquait que la vie la surprise (amazed) plusieurs fois et qu'elle etait heureuse de rendre la pareille. Ouf, j'etais tres emu de son don spontanne.





Je me sentais un peu perdu aussi, car j'ignorais exactement ce que je voulais faire comme travail. C'est un questionnement que je vis depuis des mois et qui a commence au Canada alors que je me suis rendu compte que meme si je travaillais comme cameraman, ce que je visais, je ne serais toujours pas comble car se metier ne me nourrissait plus. De plus, les possibilites de volontariats ici semblaient aussi tous venir avec des frais pour l'hebergement et/ou la nourriture. Ca me decourageait un peu mais quelqu'un d'autre du groupe est venu a ma rencontre par la suite et nous avons beaucoup parle. Il m'a explique qu'il y a toujours moyen d'expliquer la situation la ou je fais du volontariat et qu'a ce moment, tout est possible. Cet homme vit a Auroville depuis 5 mois sans le moindre sous. En echange de ses services, on lui fournit hebergement et nourriture. De plus, nous avons beaucoup de point en commun. Il a etudie en communications et cinema puis en photographie. Il a travaille en cinema de son cote mais a recemment vu la futilite de sa vie. Il travaille maintenant a differents endroits dans Auroville. Il enseigne les communications et le cinema, il est implique dans un magazine, dans une salle de cinema, dans un theatre et prepare des repas. C'est un peu ce genre de vie que je voudrais essayer ici. Essayer differents trucs, etre utile, developper mes talents, avoir du fun, vivre en communaute. Je me suis rendu compte que l'un des trucs que je ne veux plus dans ma vie est de m'enfermer dans un seul travail, dans une seule profession et surtout, dans une routine type metro-boulot-dodo. Je sais bien que la plupart de la planete vit comme ca mais moi, ca ne me convient pas, et je continue de croire que l'on peut vivre (creer sa vie) selon les profonds desirs de notre coeur. Un autre besoin important pour moi est de vivre au sein d'une communaute.







Alors voila ou j'en suis. Je crois bien tente l'experience d'Auroville. Pour ceux qui n'auraient pas encore vu le site internet, j'en rappelle l'adresse : www.auroville.org. Plusieurs possibilites de volonariats s'offre a moi. Entre autres, servir des repas et faire du jardinage. Je crois aussi m'etablir a la Saddhana Forest pour un petit bout de temps. C'est une communaute magnifique ou tout est recupere. Son but principale est la re-forestation. J'ai un projet special pour eux. Chaque vendredi, ils offrent une visite de la communaute en expliquant tout ce qu'ils y font. La visite est en anglais mais pas tous les visiteurs comprennent suffisemment l'anglais pour bien suivre. Je veux donc ecrire le texte, dans les grandes lignes, en anglais puis en faire une traduction en francais et une tres tres brouillon en espagnol. Je sais qu'ils apprecieraient car j'en ai deja parle a un des responsables.



De plus j'ai vecu plein d'autres trucs inspirants a plusieurs niveaux. J'ai suivi deux meditations guides, dont l'une portait sur l'amour. Pas l'amour au sens tres large d'Amour divin (quoique, au final, c'est le resultat que l'on atteint) mais vraiment l'amour que l'on peut ressentir pour une autre personne, bref, le sentiment amoureux. Il s'agissait de replonger dans ce sentiment pour ensuite le propager en notre etre et autour de nous. Ca m'a permis de completer une guerison a ce niveau et reellement d'ouvrir mon coeur a l'amour. Ca tombe bien, y'avait une jolie fille d'autriche a mes cotes qui semble tres ouverte a l'amour egalement et a qui je semble plaire. Elle est presentement, et pour encore quelques semaines, a la Sadhana Forest 😉







De retour au groupe de communications non-violentes, c'etait vraiment tres puissant comme experience. Sans expliquer la theorie, je dirais que l'exercice que nous avons fait et pour lequel j'etais l'heureux cobaye m'a permis de me reconcilier avec la totalite de mon etre. Car l'exercice ne portait pas sur la communication non-violente avec les autres mais bien avec soi-meme et de voir les emotions et besoins qui se cachent derriere chaque partie de notre etre. Ca m'a permis, enfin, d'accueillir la partie agressive et la partie tres rationnelle et analytique en moi. Effectivement, depuis un bon moment, j'essayais d'annihiler l'agressivite et d'arreter completement de tout analyser et, a la surprise de personne, je reussissais peu. Par contre, lorsque l'on voit le message cache derriere l'aggressivite et l'auto-condamnation, on en ressort beaucoup plus riche... C'est ce que j'ai experimente hier. A la fin, je me sentais non seulement soulage mais vivant et entier...







Mes prieres pour etre guidees ont ete largement entendues. Dans un des groupes de spiritualite que je frequentais a Montreal, on disait que Dieu etait souvent a la derniere minute, mais jamais en retard. Puis j'aimais bien aussi cette definition de la Foi de Daniel Harvey, un ""therapeute"" qui a aide plusieurs personnes a trouve leur veritable identite et a mieux saisir l'aspect spirituel de la vie : ""La Foi, c'est comme un piston, ca monte, ca descends, ca monte, ca descends, ca monte, ca descends, ca monte, ca descends, ca monte, ca descends... et c'est ca qui fait avance le vehicule. Nous, on pense qu'on avance seulement quand le piston est en haut et que l'auto arrete quand le piston est en bas, c'est pas comme ca que ca marche!!! C'est le mouvement, de haut en bas, de haut en bas, de haut en bas, qui fait avancer la Foi"". Je note que ce ne sont pas ses mots exactes mais ca resume bien ce qu'il disait.





Hier etait une tres belle soiree qui m'a redonne courage et espoir et surtout de l'amour pour mon etre TOUT ENTIER. J'en suis tres reconnaissant envers la vie et envers moi-meme. Merci JF 😉 Et merci a vous tous que j'aime et qui me manquent 😊

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Pondicherry
August 13th 2012
Published: August 13th 2012


Randonnee sur le mont Arunachala
Alors voila que nous entamons un pelerinage dans le Tamil Nadu. Au depart, il doit y avoir moi, Yolanda et une allemande dont j'ai oublie le nom. L'alemande se desite et elle est remplace par un californien nomme Steven et une Bresilienne du nom de Lilian.

Les destinations principales que nous allons visite, et les seules qui m'interestent vraiment, sont deux lieux de pelerinages for populaires pour les indiens. Le premier se nomme Tiruvanamalai. Yolanda a beaucoup de difficulte avec ce nom. Elle repete souvent ""Manamalai, Manamalai"" et tente de le dire tres rapidement pour qu'on ne se rende pas trop compte qu'elle ne le dit pas correctement. C'est vrai que c'est un nom complique, meme certains indiens ont de la difficulte a le prononce.

Tiruvanamalai est le lieu de la montagne Arunachala, l'equivalent, pour les hindous, du mont Sinai ou Moise a recu les dix commandements. La mont Arunachala est le symbole meme de Shiva, le Dieu destructeur, sur terre. On dit qu'il est entierement compose de Shiva Lingam, une pierre aux proprietes tres puissantes. De plus, il y a au pied de la montagne l'ashram d'un saint nomme Sri Maharshi. Sri Maharshi a toujours ete attire par
Belvedere du mont Arunachala
le Divin. C'est a l'age de 16 ans que la Verite lui fut revele, alors qu'il se sentait, pour une raison inexplicable, sur le point de mourrir, il s'est mis a reflechir sur qu'est-ce qui allait mourrir... et ce qui allait continuer de vivre, soit le Soi, notre veritable identite. Il explique que ceci ne fut pas un raisonnement mais bien une revelation.

En bref, ye ben ben cool.

Donc, a Tiruvanamalai, y'a son ashram au pied de la montagne.

On se rend a l'ashram. On visite donc un peu le site de l'ashram pour aboutir a une porte en metal. Je signal au passage que, sur les lieux, nous n'avons pas le droit a nos chaussures. Je le souligne parce que derriere cette porte en metal, on voit un sentier fait de pierre lisse qui monte lentement. C'est le sentier de la montagne. On s'etait dit qu'on irait y faire un tour le jour suivant mais puisque nous y voila... ben on y va, nu pieds, pour escalader le mont Arunachala. La veille, nous avons aussi croise une francaise qui se joint en cour de route a l'expedition.

Les filles sont presses sur le sentier,
Point de vue du Belvedere
Le temple de la ville de Tiruvanamallai
malgre mes suggestions de marcher lentement et d'economiser leurs energies, fautes de quoi elles seraient brulees en peu de temps, elles escalades rapidement le mont. Le californien lui est d'accord avec moi, il reste derriere et nous discutons. Il est plutot sympatique et en connait un peu sur plusieurs traditions de l'Inde. Alors que la Lilian et Yolanda sont fraichement debarquees, lui parcours l'Inde depuis 7 mois deja.

Sur la montagne, nous meditons dans deux endroits ou Sri Marshi a soit reside ou medite durant des annees. A chacun des endroits, je ressens une energie etrange et derangeante, mais je suis apparemment le seul a la ressentir. Au premier, Yolanda, fidele a son habitude, se fait photographier par une autre pelerine devant et a l'interieur du ""petit ashram"". Cependant, elle est sous le choc en regardant les photos : elle n'y apparait pas. On ne sait pas si c'est une simple erreur de photographie ou un fait mystique mais Yolanda est atteree et prends un moment avant de recupere...

On redescends pour se diriger vers le temple et on croise quelques autres lieux. Un Sadhu, c'est-a-dire, un homme ayant consacre sa vie a Dieu, nous invite a entrer
Au puit...
Au pied du mont Arunachala, un Sadhu puise de l'eau
dans un minuscule temple. Il fait une ceremonie en notre honneur pour ensuite nous donner un Darshan, c'est-a-dire une benediction. Alors qu'il me barbouille le front je note la presence de billets dans l'assiette dont il se serre pour transporter la poudre avec laquelle il nous benit. Tiens donc, on est encore tombe dans le panneau ou quoi? Il nous explique que l'argent servira a nourrir et vetir des centaines de Sadhus qui viendront ici a la fin du mois. Son sourire et son regard m'avait donne confiance pourtant, car il paraissait tellement joyeux... enfin bref...

Nous redescendons la montagne et arrivons a la ville, toujours pieds nus... Ben dis donc, les rues cimentes, parsemees de roches et de dechets sont pas mal plus chaudes et moins confortables que les pierres lisses de la montagne. Et la, je ne parle pas de l'asphalte que nous evitons a tout prix en route vers le temple. Ben oui, tant qu'a etre la. Sinon, nous devons revenir en touc-touc vers l'ashram puis re-revenir vers le temple, aussi bien en finir maintenant, non?

En chemin vers le temple, des indiens se moque de nous. A se promener ainsi dangereusement denudes des pieds,
Entree principale
nous sommes plus pelerins que les pelerins. On visite le temple pis c'est ben ben le fun. Ma partie preferee est quand je suis beni par l'elephant... Non, en fait c'est l'elephant lui-meme... Bien dompte, il tends la trompe pour qu'on lui donne quelques roupies qu'il remet a son maitre. Une fois les roupies remis, il nous donne un petit coup de trompe sur le front ou sur l'epaule. C'est pas une super vie pour un elephant... Mais je suis surtout ebahit par son regard hyper-inteligent. Je n'ai jamais vue une bete au regard si doue d'intelligence. Des qu'il m'a vu, il savait que j'attendais la benediction et est fonce vers moi. Steven, le Californien, racontait quand a lui qu'il ne faisait qu'observe la scene et qu'il avait percu que l'elephant savait qu'il etait la, qu'il ne faisait qu'observe... Anyway...

Puis on est alle mange pres du temple... Lilian, la chanceuse, avait une deuxieme paire de sandale dans sa sacoche, par pure coincidence car elle avait change de chaussures avant d'aller a l'ashram et avait range sa premiere paire dans sa sacoche. Elle avait pitie de nous et avait achete deux sacs de tissus colores, un jaune, un orange,
Point de vue de l
Point de vue d'une entree du temple de Tiruvanamalai
pour ceux d'entre nous qui ne supportait plus la chaleur de l'asphalte. Les autres refusaient poliment, pas moi, j'ai revetu les sacs en guise de sandales... Les indiens se marraient bien, l'un d'eux ma dit en pointant mes pieds : ""eh, nice looking!"" (he, ca te va bien!).

Nous nous rendons le lendemain vers Rameswaram. Les autres decident d'aller a la plage et J'en profite donc pour visiter le temple seul. En signe de purification, je me trempe, completement vetu, dans la mer de bengale avant de proceder au temple. Une fois cela fait, je me rends vers le temple aux 22 puits. Chacun vous benit. Chaque eau provient soit d'un lieu saint ou vous procure une benediction specifique (vous serez riche, vous irez au ciel, vos fautes seront pardonnes, vous serez libere de l'ingrattitude, etc. etc.). C'est une tournee plutot particuliere. A chacun des puits, un guide plonge un petit seau et le retire pour vous en aspergez. Si vous avez ete bien avise comme j'ai eu la chance de l'etre, vous transportez un sac de plastique avec du linge de rechange. J'ai ete egalement chanceux de suivre une famille de pelerin, sinon j'aurais eu a paye un
Yolanda et ""Dumbo""
C'est surement un sacrilege que d'appeler cet elephant qui donne des benedictions ""Dumbo"", mais bon, c'est cute ;)
guide seul, ce qui m'aurait ete bien plus dispendieux.

Une fois le bain des eaux benites finit, je rentre et je prends une bone douche. Les eaux benites, apres tout, ne sont pas les plus propres du monde. Surtout pas celle du dernier puit qui provient du Gange, hyper-pollue avec, entres autres, les cadavres d'une multitude de personnes. Pour plusieurs, le Gange sert effectivement de cimetiere. A Varanassi, il est apparement pas rare d'apercevoir des corps flotte. Je neregrette pas de ne pas avoir visiter Varanassi.

Par la suite, je choisi de revenir a Pondicherry alors que les autres poursuivent leur chemin. Vous vous rappellez de cette partie de Karam a laquelle j'ai ete invite? Bien, dans cette maison, il y a une famille qui reside maintenant en France mais sejourne dans leur patrie natale, soit Pondicherry. Le francais aidant, je me suis rapidement lie d'amitie avec eux.

Hier, comme a chacun de leurs passages ici , ils ont distribue un repas pour 150 personnes dans un orphelinat. Ils ont tout fait de A a Z, acheter les ingredients, prepares et servis le repas. J'ai eu le privilege de servir moi-meme quelques assiettes. J'ai passe un bon

bout de temps a discuter avec le pere qui est bien sympatique. Il a un accent qui oscille entre le Sud de la France et l'Afrique. Par exemple : ""Ici y'a beaucoup les voleurs. C'est normal. Les gens n'ont pas le travail, il faut manger, alors qu'est-ce que tu veux faire, hein? Qu'est-ce que tu veux faire?"" Vous pouvez imaginez un peu.

En route vers la ville, je vois une petite fanfare. Une fete religieuse de quartier. Je croise un indien qui me barbouille allegrement le visage avec une poudre colore. Heureusement que je connais ce type de fete. Je vois tous les gens autour de moi vraiment plein de couleurs. Certains me voient et me font signes de danser avec eux, ce que je fais avec joie.

Ah, pis la, les vacances sont finies. Je dois trouver du travail, ouais, mes reserves s'epuisent. Je vous en redonne des nouvelles. A plus!!

Asia » India » Tamil Nadu » Pondicherry
August 9th 2012
Published: April 1st 2013


Pondy street
Tamil Nadu:


Famous for his Temples, devotees and poetry.
09/08 : arrival in Chennai for 2 nights.



Been sick on our way into the country, we didn't manage to see Chennai - nevertheless nothing missed as this big city is not inviting because of his chaos, dust, and hot weather.
11/08 and 12/08: Pondicherry - Puducherry - Pondy: the French flavoured Tamil town.



What is left by the frenchies is some colonial houses and some arts. The streets on the french side start with the typical ""Rue"" instead of street and names can change from the beginning to the end.

There is a distinctive difference in the cleanless of the street as soon as you enter the french corner. We stayed at Villa Labourdonnais - owned by a french man Gerard Louis who lives in india for 20 years now. We started to take the pace of India and to accommodate ourselves to this new life and way of dealing with things...

Already we were happy to be far from the sound of horns and rickshaws. On the streets, you share the pavement with cows, stalls, dogs, beggers, and the road shares
Pondy street
its amount of noisy vehicules: motorcycles, rickshaws, cars and trucks.

The constant beeping, horn-blowing is difficult to adjust to and it does get on your nerves!
13/08 to 14/08: Trichy (Tiruchirappalli)



Home to the most famous and oldest temples in India, the Temples are as beautiful as the one from the Mayans/Peru.

We visited the Sri Jambukeshwara Temple, the Sri Rangan Temple and the Rock Fort Temple in 1 day.

Some temples charge for camera and of course no shoes inside - even in your bag!

One had an elephant - protector of the Temple wandering and blessing devotees.

We had a beautiful encounter with a Indian women who has a shaved head which means she dedicates her life to her God even if she's got a family (2 kids). We couldn't have a discussion but we had a kind of understanding and visited the Temple together. she was very nice towards me and we were sad to say goodbye. She was a beautiful person. A truely special moment!



One annoyance is that non-Hindus are generally not allowed in the interesting part of the big temples. Try to trick them
the man and the cow
in putting some Tika/Bindi - your third eye - like hindus - to pass through. It worked for us 😊

1: Preparation d'une semelle 32 secs
2: On colle la semelle... 14 secs


Un grand maitre indien
Ce grand guru indien nous enseigne l'art du bien-etre dans le moment present.
Avant toute chose, avant l'aventure incroyable a la pyramide des corps contents, je vous parle un peu des deux videos. J'etais avec Annabelle, mon amie Francaise et non ma niece, et elle devait s'acheter une paire de sandales. La petite ""boutique"" que nous avions trouve avait quelques paires quelle aimait, mais aucune n'etait complete, il leur manquait tous la semelle. Mais comme on entends souvent en Inde : ""No problem, no problem"" (pas d'probleme, pas d'probleme). Le gars a dit qu'il nous fertait ca en moins de deux. J'ai donc filme deux petites etapes pour cela. Remarquez la dexterite de cet homme qui se sert quasiment autant de son pied que de ses mains. Il fait ce travail depuis 14 ans mais venait d'ouvrir sa boutique. Il en etait tres fier. Il fabrique vraiment toute sorte de truc en cuir qui paraisse vraiment tres bien et assez abordable dans l'ensemble. Des saccoches, des sacs a dos, des ceintures, etc. etc.. Il nous donnait sa carte : ""Monica footwear"" (qui se traduirait plus ou moins bien par chaussures Monica). ""Name of my daughter"" qu'il nous dit en sourriant. (Le nom de ma fille!)

Depuis, j'ai rencontre une autre voyageuse, Yolanda, espagnole.
Resultat final
La sandale avec sa semelle, on ne le voit peut-etre pas tres bien sur la photo, mais je vous jure que c'est un travail professionnel et tres bien fait.
Elle debarquait d'Auroville et nous nous sommes rapidement lie d'amitie. Elle a une energie toute joyeuse qui fait sourire tout le monde sur son passage. Un vrai petit rayon de soleil, avec des passages nuageux quand elle se demande quoi faire par la suite. Moi qui connait legerement les questionnements aussi angoissants qu'inutile, je ris bien avec elle ;p Elle et d'autres nouveaux amis dont je parlerai dans une chronique future m'accompagneront pour quelques jours dans de nouvelles aventures. Yolanda m'a propose un bon deal, on ne se demande pas si on va a tel endroit qui a l'air ben interessant, on y va!!! Ca me convient parfaitement 😊

Et maintenant, passons a la pyramide des corps contents.

Une francaise est arrivee hier matin a notre auberge, la Joy Guest House. Cette femme vient a Auroville depuis 1980, elle y vient tous les ans au moins. Elle connait donc des tresors caches, comme Goupi, un masseur bien particulier qui demeurre a 5 minutes a pied de l'endroit ou nous residons.

Je souligne au passage que ce matin la, je venais de tres mal dormir. Je me questionnais sans cesse a savoir si je partais ce jour la
Vu d'un guest house
Ceci est une vue que l'on peut voir en grimpant les marches d'un escalier d'un guest house (disons, auberge) voisin de celui ou je reside.
ou si je demeurrais quelques jours de plus. J'avais un faux sentiment que je DEVAIS partir alors que cette decision me rendait un peu triste puisque je commencais vraiment a me plaire ici avec mes nouveaux amis. Puis je me suis dit que j'allais rester quelques jours de plus, c'est ensuite que j'ai rencontre Marie, la femme qui nous a introduite a Goupi.

Elle m'en parle avec une grande joie dans les yeux. ""Ce n'est pas qu'un massage"" me dit-elle, ""Il parle vraiment au corps et il le ressent direct, il permet reellement de relacher plein de tensions et de trucs negatifs"" (Bon, ce n'est pas ses paroles exacts, elle etait beaucoup plus precise et elaboree dans sa description mais sa resume bien) Je me disais que c'etait exactement ce dont j'avais besoin. Elle me previent qu'il peut etre difficile d'avoir un rendez-vous avec lui. Il n'a pas de telephone, donc si on ne l'attrape pas durant son dejeuner, avant qu'il commence sa journee, entre 7h30 et 8h00, on peut devoir attendre qu'il termine un traitement et prendre rendez-vous a ce moment la. Il est passe l'heure de son dejeuner et moi, Marie et Yolanda nous rendons a sa
banian banian sais-tu jou-er....
Dans le ""Centre guest house"" (l'auberge du centre), il y a un gigantesque banian. Cet arbre, bien typique a l'inde, a ceci de particulier : D'immense branche poussent et s'etirent loin dans tous les sens puis, quelques troncs poussent directement de ces branches vers le sol pour les supporter, ce qui donne rapidement l'illusion d'un autre arbre qui pousse. Cet arbre peut donc devenir une petite foret a lui seul. Ici, il y'en a deux je crois.
demeurre. Juste sa demeurre semble empreinte de serenite. Il y a un magnifique petit jardin avec des dizaines de papillons qui virevoltent joyeusement au-dessus d'un petit sentier qui mene a la salle de massage.

Goupi est en fait un homme Francais qui etait un disciple de Mere, cette sainte a l'origine de la fondation d'Auroville. Comme elle est decede il y a un bout de temps, j'imagine que c'est un des rares encore vivant. un de ceux aussi qui a vu l'evolution d'Auroville depuis ces debuts, en 1968.

Nous tachons donc de voir si Goupi est disponible et, a notre grande surprise, il l'est, et nous acceuille joyeusement. Marie lui dit ""Je t'emmene des corps qui ont besoin de tes soins!"" Et ils rient tous les deux. Cet etre ma plus tout de suite. Il a en permanence ou presque un sourire joyeux et le regard emerveille. On a bien rigole avec lui. Quand il a su que Yolanda etait espagnole, il s'est aussitot mis a parle espagnol a la perfection et disait a tout bout de champs ""Ole!!!"". Il nous parlait de son travail et il disait qu'il faisait danser les corps avec des gestes de ces
Trio infernal
Moi, Annabelle et Yolanda, Yolanda et d'autres seront mes partenaires de voyage pour les prochains jours ou semaine.
doigts en chantant : ""pom pom pom pom"". Il expliquait en fait que ce n'etait pas lui, mais Mere ou le Divin qui passait a travers lui car il mettait son mental completement de cote. Dans les talons en fait 😉 Alors il nous amene a sa salle de massage pour nous la montrer. Il s'agit d'une hutte dont le toit est en forme de pyramide et c'est ce qu'il appelle ""la pyramide des corps contents.""

Nous discutons tous les quatre un bon moment et c'est un echange empreint de joie et de serenite. Goupi nous raconte sa rencontre avec le Dalai Lama lorsque celui-ci etait de passage a Auroville. Le Dalai Lama a vu Goupi dans la foule, il a ecarquille les yeux, a ecarte tout le monde sur son passage jusqu'a ce qu'il soit devant Goupi. Le Dalai Lama lui a alors dit : ""You and me, we are the same!"" (Toi et moi, on est pareil). M. Lama a ensuite continuer sa ballade avec Goupi comme si Goupi etait son frere, preuve a l'appui puisque Goupi nous montre une photo de l'evenement, le Dalai Lama avec le bras par-dessus les epaules de Goupi alors qu'il poursuit
La pyramide des corps contents
Que dire de plus?
sa visite d'Auroville. C'est quelque chose ca comme on dit.

A un moment, Goupi se met a chanter un mantra tout en frappant continuellement un bol Tibetain. Je sais pas ce qui s'est passe exactement mais c'etait assez fort que j'ai senti le besoin de m'allonger un peu sur le sol avec les larmes a l'oeil. C'etait comme une invitation du Divin a laisser aller toutes mes souffrances, que tout allait et est correct.

Plus tard, il y a eu le massage. Goupi s'amuse en massant comme un enfant. Il chante, il fait des bruits de moteur alors qu'il glisse ses mains sur le corps, il joue continuellement. Il ne cessait de repeter des trucs comme : ""Ah oui... tres chouette"" ""Ce corps est bon pour le service"" ""Ce corps est perdu pour le corps medical"" etc. A un moment, alors que j'etais couche sur le dos, il jouait avec mon bras pour voir s'il etait flexible. Tout en ce faisan, il fredonnait un air de chanson classique et me regardait dans les yeux avec un grand sourire. Ca m'a donne l'impression d'etre un bebe de quelques mois et que lui c'etait mon grand pere qui jouait avec
Trio beni
Moi, Goupi et Marie, celle qui nous a presente ce grand maitre et personnage haut en couleur en plus de nous donner de nombreuses informations precieuses sur nos prochaines destinations.
moi. Tres chouette. Puis, apres le massage, il me montre quelques exercices pour redonner de la souplesse a ma colonne car, comme la majorite des gens, plusieurs vertebres se deplacaient en blocs plutot qu'individuellement. Mon rendez-vous d'une heure trente a finalement dure trois heures pour la modique somme, (contribution volontaire), de 300 roupies, c'est a dire plus ou moins 6$. Apres le massage, contrairement a ce que je ressens normalement, j'etais energise et j'avais vraiment envie de bouger! Je me sentais joyeux et dynamique. Apres chacun de mes exercices, c'est aussi ce que je ressens pendant une courte periode. L'important, pendant les exercices, c'est d'envoyer le mental dans les talons...

We woke up at 1:30am for the 7 hour journey to Hill Station. After lots of sleeping and a few short stops we arrived. It was much cooler and the surroundings were lovely, green and picturesque. After a short break to settle in and enjoy some breakfast we jumped back on the bus to head off for our trek. It took just over two hours and the views were amazing from the view point called Dolphins Nose Point at 4500 ft. It was strange to think that the sights we were witnessing were in India. After the walk we had lunch and a rest then headed out on a shorter walk round the town finishing up in a Domino's where everyone tucked into pizza. Everyone was really tired and were all asleep by 9:30.

After a good sleep and breakfast we were back on the buses and heading out to various viewpoints. We visited 4 different locations which had spectacular views and a lot of mischevious monkeys who attempted and sucesfully relived Annie of her water bottle. On the way back we had a short stop off for some shopping and a few of the group purchased some local handmade chocolates. We returned for lunch then headed back on the long journey to Tirunelveli.

Everyone enjoyed the trek and the change in climate and surroundings.

Bomb squad
Une camionnette de la ""Bomb squad"" (equipe anti-bombe) est stationnee non loin de son poste.
Au moment ou j'ecris ces lignes, j'ai deja quitte Pondicherry depuis le 25 juillet mais bon, je suis en retard dans les nouvelles alors voila, je vous raconte encore des tas de trucs 😉

Je songeais serieusement a m'installer dans cette ville pour une bonne duree. Des amis avec qui j'avais joue au Karam plus tot dans la semaine m'informaient que l'appartement juste au-dessus du leur et duquel ils etaient proprietaire, un petit studio situe sur le bord de l'ocean allait se liberer le mois prochain. Le prix etait ridiculement bas pour un occidental, soit 1100 roupies par mois, c'est a dire 22$. J'aurais pu payer l'appart pour un an et avoir encore une bonne reserve d'argent pour mes depenses. De plus, comme la ville abrite et recoit la visite de nombreux francais, on m'assurait qu'il me serait facile de me trouver un emploi. La ville me plaisait bien, alors je me disais : ""pourquoi pas?""

Je commence donc a m'informer de differentes activites que je peux y faire. Je rend visite a un endroit ou on donne des cours de theatres et on m'invite a une repetition. Mesdames, vous auriez ete emerveille du spectacle. Deux jeunes acteurs dans
Bus de police
Quelques bus de polices sont stationnes pres du ""Government square"" (Carre du gouvernement) a Pondicherry. Ce jour la, presque tous les commerces sont fermes pour protester contre une nouvelle hausse de la taxe de vente, la VAT. Cette taxe ne cesse d'augmenter depuis des mois. Des manifestations pacifiques ont egalement eue lieu.
la vingtaine bien en forme, torse nu, s'executant a des gestes d'arts martiaux tout en sueur eclaire que par quelques fenetres. Moi-meme qui suis un gars hetero, je trouvais le spectacle et ces hommes tres beaux. Leur piece etait une repetition d'un episode hindou mythique. C'etait interessant et je devais les rejoindre le mercredi suivant pour le premier cours. Ce cours consistait, en fait, a carrement batir une piece de A a Z. Interessant...

Sinon, je m'informe aussi a l'Alliance francaise, ou la encore, pour peu de sous, j'ai acces a des ateliers de theatres, des cours de musiques, de danse, de tamoule, etc. Je me dis que c'est Genial.

Je me promene en ville, je me perds un peu dans des coins que je n'avais pas explore, des coins un peu plus bordeliques autour de ma residence. Je decouvre un temple ou on joue de la musique et derriere ce temple une grande etendue d'eau ou les fideles se purifient. A la fin de ma promenade, je decouvre un petit cafe sympa, vous savez comment je les aime ceux la, qui me fait pense au Starbucks, le summum quoi. Ca s'appelle :""Cafe coffee day"", c'est une chaine
Klaxon pouet
Un des klaxons d'une auto-rickshaw comme on peut en voir a Pondicherry. Ceux-ci sont manuels et emmettent le meme bruit qu'un jouet pour enfant que l'on serre, tres marrant ;)
indienne en fait. On y sert les trucs habituels des cafes en plus de quelques petits trucs indiens. J'aime bien l'humour de cet endroit. Le signe a l'entree dit : ""Enter, it's brewing"" au lieu de simplement ""Open"" (""Entrez, c'est c'est en preparation"" plutot que ""Ouvert"") Lorsque l'on finit l'assiette, il y est ecrit : ""If you can read this, you know you want more!"" (Si vous pouvez lire ceci, vous savez que vous en voulez plus) et ainsi de suite. En plus, l'une des employes est une jolie indienne a qui je semble plaire et me fait un peu de l'oeil, c'est bien une premiere pour moi ici et ca ne me deplait pas.

Mais, au bout d'une nuit de sommeil, j'en suis convaincu, mon voyage ne s'arrete pas a Pondicherry. Je dois d'abord aller a Auroville ou je suis presentement, et je suis vraiment content d'etre venu ici. Je vous donne plus de nouvelles sous peu!!!

Dortoirs
Les dortoirs du ""Joy guest house"" (Residences Joie)
Je suis donc maintenant a Auroville depuis quelques jours et c'est litteralement un petit paradis sur terre. Du moins, quand on y est de passage. je vous laisse vous informer, pour ceux que ca interesse, du fonctionnement de la ville et tout sur le site internent de celle-ci a www.auroville.org. Ca me sauvera bien des details.

J'ai rencontre, des mon arrivee, une jeune voyageuse francaise du nom d'Anabelle et nous nous sommes lies d'amities tres vite. Notre premiere activite, je l'ecrivais dans un blogue precedent, a ete de nous baigner a la mer et elle y a connu le choc des crottes on the beach 😉 Les deplacements ici doivent souvent se faire en velo ou en mobilette car tout est tres eparpille, c'est souvent avec elle que je me deplace. J'ai essaye une fois de conduire mais c'est la galere quand on est deux, sur du sable, et que l'on est pas habitue. Vu la temerite des conducteurs ici, je prefere lui laisser le privilege de conduire 😉 On a beaucoup partage sur nos experiences de voyage, surtout celle en Inde depuis notre arrivee ici et ca aussi ca a fait un bien enorme. Vraiment, je suis choye.
Faith
Ma premiere chambre, ""Faith"" (Foi), situee juste sous le toit en hutte, dans les dortoirs.

Vous verrez par les photos, Auroville est beaucoup plus relaxe comme ville et il y a beaucoup de gens qui viennent de partout dans le monde. Ca aussi ca fait du bien, on se sent moins isole. Meme les indiens ici sont tres occidentalises, ouverts sur le monde. J'ai eu avec quelques uns d'entres eux des conversations passionnantes.

Il y avait un petit truc qui me demangeait par contre. Pour loger a Auroville, on doit normalement faire du benevolat. Ce n'est pas obligatoire mais fortement suggere. Je n'avais pas envie du tout mais je me suis dit que j'allais le faire tout de meme. Je me choisi donc une chambre dans un petit endroit nomme ""Joy Guest House"" (Residences Joie). La chambre est situee dans un dortoir sous un toit en paille et j'adore l'idee sauf que : pas de ventillateur et un trou dans le moustiquaire. La chambre s'appelle ""Faith"" (Foi) Je dors mal, je me fais manger de partout. Le lendemain, je me trouve un endroit pour m'impliquer benevolement pendant une semaine. L'activite est interessante mais l'obligation me pue au nez, je songe a m'y inscrire neanmoins. Puis la, paf, 4e diarhee en 4 semaines doublee d'une
Danse hall
Sous cette immense hutte, il y a parfois des petites fetes ou l'on danse.
indigestion. L'hote de la residence me dit de me reposer, de ne m'occuper de rien (Genre elle et d'autres vont me chercher la nourriture). Pour etre sur de mieux dormir, je change de chambre, une chambre seule avec un bon ventillateur et un moustiquaire intact. Lorsque je vois le nom de la chambre, je sourris : ""Surrender"" (Abandon, dans le sens de lacher prise) Ca fait qq fois que la vie m'envois le message. Alors je commence a me dire que je suis en vacance et que je vais prendre le temps de rien faire. Ou plutot de NE RIEN FAIRE DE SERIEUX!!!

Avec d'autres amis, on discute et on va a une soiree cinema organisee a Auroville. On y presente un film anglais nomme ""The best exotic marigold hotel"" (L'Hotel de tous les possibles). Un film sur des retraites qui se retrouvent tous dans un hotel pour personnes ages en Inde pour une raison ou une autre. Je recommande chaudement ce film a ceux qui veulent comprendre un peu mieux le quotidien que j'ai pu vivre depuis mon arrivee en Inde. Sinon, je le recommande pareil. J'ai mis un lien sur ma page Facebook vers un resume fait
Interieur du Danse Hall
par le journal ""La Presse"". Depuis que j'ai vu ce film et relu mes notes persos de voyage, j'apprecie aussi beaucoup plus ce que j'ai vecu et continue de vivre ici.

Ce matin, moi et Anabelle que-j'ignore-toujours-si-on-ecrit-avec-un-""n""-ou-deux-""n"", sommes allez nous promener le long des plages, incluant la plage a caca. Mais en chemin, on voit un mini temple, sans trop savoir si on a le droit d'y entrer, des enfants nous y invitent, ils reclamment que l'on prennent des milliers de photos d'eux et c'etait la un des beaux moments de mon voyage.

Due to the fact we're going on our trek later on this evening, it's unlikely that we'll be able to update the blog for the next few days. If you don't hear from us, please don't panic as access to a computer in the final days of our time in India will be difficult. When we leave Cape Comorin on Thursday we will have a 17 hour train journey and 12 hours of flights to endure - we will definitely be able to update the blog at Abu Dhabi late Friday/early Saturday (your time).

We will endeavour to pop on and regale you with tales of derring-do; Seb's schmoozing; Kate's ever-increasing bravery; Annie's over-coming of a multitude of phobias; Harry's chanting; Olly's tanning regime; Bethan's ability to talk/moan the hind legs off a donkey; Rob's wit; Jayde's gurning; Charles' showmanship; Jack's constant giggling and inability to speak 'propa'; Sarah's embarassment at Jack; Remy's love of cereal; Erin's singing and bizarre noises; Sam Clarkson's burping; Jay's ability to rise to any challenge; Tim's addiction to Red Bull; Rossina's sarcasm; Michael's skinny legs; Jake's devotion to Bear Gryll's; Tom's superb attitude and work ethic; Sam Coop's passion for Disney songs and Alex's look of constant bewilderment.

Bateau endommage
Un matin, alors que je suis encore a Pondicherry, je decide d'explorer le cote Nord, du cote des villages de pecheurs. On me dit qu'il y a par la des plages beaucoup mieux que celle ou je me suis baigne deux jours plus tot. Des plages sans dechets et ou d'autres occidentaux se baignent aussi. Alors je pars a pied et j'explore. Bon, je tombe sur une premiere petite plage pleine de bateaux de pecheurs, je me dit que je ne veux pas etre l'attraction principale, moi qui est non seulement le seul blanc mais le seul qui me tremperais dans l'eau, alors je continue mon chemin en cherchant un endroit plus discret, plus intime. Je marche et marche et marche et ne voit que des bateaux de pecheurs l'un apres l'autre a chaque plages que je decouvre. Je marche je marche marche, mais pas seul dans la nuit pour ceux qui connaisse la chanson, plus tot seul le matin. Je marche et voit un petit endroit de l'autre cote de l'immense rempart de pierre qui semble parfait.

Ah oui, je ne vous ai pas dit. Le rempart de pierre que l'on trouve tout le long de la rive de
ballade sur la plage
Pondicherry a ete erige apres le Tsunami. A cet endroit, le Tsunami n'a pas fait autant de degat mais il en fait tout de meme et a traumatise pas mal de monde. Les pecheurs s'aventurent moins loin en mer et certains ont carrement change de metier. Avant, parait-il, il n'y avait pas tant de dechets partout, les gens prenait soin des environs et il y avait des tortues de mer qui venaient pondrent tout pres. Mais voila, le Tsunami est arrive, a fait des ravages, le niveau de la mer est monte de facon permanente et une apathie s'est installe. Ils ont vecu, en masse, un traumatisme collectif.

Donc je vois une petite plage bien tranquille de l'autre cote de ce rempart, puis un indien arrive sur cette plage. Merde. Puis un autre. Le second leve sa ""jupe"" (les pecheurs portent un bout de tissu enroule autoure de leur taille) et s'accroupit, puis au bout d'un moment il va se nettoyer les fesses dans la mer. A-t-il vraiment fait ses besoins, la, comme ca, sur la plage? Naaaaaaannnnn, que je me dis, pas possible. Mais je ne prends pas de chance. Un, je ne veux pas etre l'attraction principale
Bateaux de pecheurs
de ces deux spectateurs et deux, que ce soit ce que je crois ou non, je ne veux pas me baigner la ou je crois que l'on a chier. Je continue donc de marcher, marcher et marcher. En route, j'appercois une ou deux crottes sur la plage qui me paraissent trop grosses pour etre des crottes de chiens. Je me pose encore la question... Naaaaan, pas possible, j'hallucine, ca peut pas etre ca.

Puis j'arrive enfin dans un endroit ou il y a des palmiers, ou les bateaux de pecheurs sont loin et les quelques dechets entasses dans un coin. Je me dis que c'est l'endroit parfait. Je marche un peu et puis... une grosse crotte, une autre grosse crotte, une troisieme grosse crotte... En fait, je ne peux faire trois pas sans croiser le chemin de ces crottes et je ne peux plus nier l'evidence, il s'agit bel et bien de merde humaine.... Beeuuuuuuuarrrrrrk!!! Et puis pendant ma promenade, je vois une bonne demi-douzaine d'indiens faire leur besoin la, sous mes yeux, pas plus gene que s'ils avaient ete des chiens... Alors je continue ma marche, me disant que les occidentaux ne se baignaient surement pas a cet
Depart pour la mer

endroit...

Je marche et je marche et je marche... Chaque fois, je vois toujours un point a l'horizon qui me donne espoir. Je vois cette fois une structure en bois au loin. Quand j'y arrive, il s'agit de la figure de Ganesh monte sur une petite charpente en bois. Ganesh, c'est le Dieu elephant. J'entends aussi, a travers des hauts parleurs installes un peu partout, des prieres hindus accompagnes d'une sorte de tambour creux et aigu et de certains cuivres. Je trouve ca genial. Juste apres ce village, je vois enfin une tres large plage, sans bateau de pecheurs et sans crotte avec quelques dechets. Je me fous des quelques dechets et je me baigne, aucun dechet ne m'a derange et je passe un bon moment.

Le retour a ete passablement long. Je vous ai dit que j'ai marche, non? Je regrette de ne pas avoir achete d'eau. J'ai soif et personne dans les vilalges ne semblent en vendre. Je marche et marche et marche... A un moment, j'ai vraiment chaud, j'ai soif et je suis encore loin de ma residence. Je suis sur la plage aux crottes que j'ai baptise la chiotte du village. J'ai vraiment chaud...
Depart en mer
Des garcons partent a la peche sur un bateau de fortune dans un village pres de Pondicherry
Je repere un coin moins ""contamine"" qu'un autre. Je mets mes vetements entre deux tas de merdes situes a environ trois metres l'un de l'autre. J'en enterre un, je ne fais rien avec l'autre et je plonge. Ouais, j'ai eu le temps d'assimiler l'information et d'evaluer le tout, aucune chance, le temps que je me baigne, que lamer ramasse les crottes et les ramasse sur moi. Je sors de l'eau, j'ai comme une petite envie de numero deux... Je regarde a gauche et a droite, les gens sont loin et de toute facon, c'est pas eux qui me jugeraient... Si j'osais...

Naaaaaannnn.

Je poursuis mon chemin. Je croise des occidentaux qui se baignent. Deux couples, ce qui inclus donc deux filles en bikinis. L'une est assise sur la plage, l'autre se baigne. Quand je vous parle d'attraction principale, ben chui bien content d'etre un homme. Les mecs ici sont tellement peu habitue de voir l'epiderme d'une femme. ll y avait une bonne dizaine d'homme rassemble en face d'elle pour admirer le spectacle, dont un avec une camera pour enregister le tout!!!! Enfin, bon, je continue mon chemin.

Je marche et marche, passe devant une ecole de surf...
La plage a caca
Evidemment, je n'ai pas voulu degoute personne en montrant des gros plans de tas de merdes que l'on trouve par dizaines sur cette plage, mais c est effectivement dans ce lieu aux allures paradiasiaques ou bon nombre de pecheurs font leur besoin.
m'informe pour de l'eau, non, il n'y en a pas... Je finis par trouver un endroit ou on vend du jus de mangues. Je bois donc d'une traite deux minuscules bouteilles de jus de mangues. Puis, pres de chez moi, je finis par trouver de l'eau... Dieu que c'est bon de l'eau pure quand on a soif!!!!

Je rentrerai dans les details plus tard, mais je vous raconte rapidement qu'a Auroville, ou je suis presentement, j'ai rencontrer une jolie francaise avec qui je suis alle me baigner. Non, pas de potins interessant. Mais nous nous baignons, pres des bateaux de peches. Je lui avais raconte mon aventure et tout a coup, j'apercois un des villageois faire ses besoins sur le bord la plage. Je le montre a ma nouvelle amie qui, soudainement, ne veut plus se baigner. Je ne sais pas trop pourquoi ;p

Once upon a time, in a land far, far away (60km from Tirunelveli), there went a party of 22 scholars and 5 adults. They were trusted with the immense task of visiting 4 waterfalls without being groped by the locals. They voyaged a perilous journey spanning 2 hours across the dusty roads of southern India.

We meet our travellers on arriving at the first waterfall. Vast was it in size and of rocky appeal. As they travelled closer, their brows began to furrow as swarms of topless, over-weight Indians visually interrogated the group. The atmosphere thickened as each group member renounced their chance to wash in the first waterfall. And so they journeyed on...

Alas, their 60km journey was not all in-vain for the second waterfall was much to their delight. For glory! Waves crashed down as spirits rose; the entirety of the group (except Mr. Gilmore who was manning the bags) lept in. This enjoyment continued with the third waterfall also.

Then came The Fourth. Titanic in proportion, yet our travellers were undeterred. Despite the gender segregation of the group, they rallied on. The men took the left side as the women battled through to the right. The women were successful in their plight as they were aided by the enforcers of law. The path soon cleared as the women bathed, free from Tamil-onlookers. They followed the waterfall downwards. It was as steep as it was slippery, however the travellers remained unscathed.

As the sun curled to the west, and the day was in twilight, our travellers felt comforted in the fact that they had not been groped, today.

Today was our final day at the offsite village project! It was so sad to leave but they made the day really special for us. We visited the day care centre for the aged one last time and sang for them as well as donating a sari or a longhi for each person. We also did a collection amongst us and managed to collect over 5,000 rupees for them.

A few of the group got offered a chance to go into the classrooms and take part in the lessons. We taught them nursery rhymes and gave them gifts including board games, colouring pencils and sports equipment. All the children were extremely excited and grateful for the gifts. This was sad for all the people who worked on the project as it meant leaving the children they had grown fond of.

They showed their appreciation by holding a celebratory send off party where the locals turned up. We played cricket against the local village team which ended in a tie, played volleyball against the locals and the evening was rounded up with a celebratory ceremony in which we were all presented with flower garlands by members of the village. A great evening was had by all!

Tuesday was our first day back doing project work after a luxurious weekend of temples, elephants and butchering an Oasis classic. As with the previous project days, we split into two groups. Half of us stayed on-site and the rest of us travelled to our off-site project.

Those of us with the common sense to stay away from Indian roads and children, remained on-site to continue renovating the building. The rafters were to be painted and there was a large pile of stones to be moved and placed in order to lay the foundations for a patio, essentially. This was repetitive, but as ever the group pulled together to make it a laugh. This was until Mr. Gillmore sadly sprained his ankle towards the end of the day. Phil assures us he'll be fine for the trek, and Sir's spirits remain high.

Meanwhile, the off-site group had a slightly more sombre and eye-opening day. Upon arriving at our project, it became clear that most of the days work needed to be completed by the builders. Rev. Paul invited us to visit the town's elderly day-care centre. Rev. Paul is particularly active in the town and was proud to introduce us to everyone. The stories and lives of the town's lovely elderly community provided the shock factor that many of us were anxious of when we signed up for the trip. One lady's tale was particularly moving and emotional, which left a few members of the team teary eyed. To hear stories of abuse and neglect in a country with such a family-orientated culture really hit home hard. This inspired us to take action and we have various ideas as to how we can help the centre move forward.

In the evening, to lift spirits, the teachers organised a riddle themed treasure hunt. A team of Rob, Erin, Jayde and Sarah were victorious and won themselves a ride in a Tuc-tuc to the local ice cream parlour. We were all thrilled for them and not at all jealous...

Today (Wednesday), a group of us visited 2 local mission hospitals. They were fascinating in that they were much better than I was expecting. They reminded me in many ways of our own beloved St. Helier (I use the word ""beloved"" loosely), but with much more grime, and far, far smaller. It was good to see that it wasn't completely private healthcare provided, with a ""Charity Ward"" providing free healthcare to many. When we were finished we returned home and worked on the on-site project for the rest of the afternoon, which consisted of smashing the floor apart, with a bit of painting on the side. At the off-site project, they began to cement the walls and floor.

All in all, another quality couple of days, and time is going far too fast for our liking!

See you soon,

Alex and Sam

After an evenings practise, we felt we were fully prepared for our sold out performance to what seemed like half of Tirunelveli. It was surreal turning up and being cheered walking through a sea of 7000 school girls, eager to hear our number. We were treated to a performance of their own, at which point the nerves kicked in. After a quick welcoming from the headmistress, we hit the stage and belted out possibly the worst version of 'Oh Happy Day' you will ever not hear - unless you come to our celebration evening and watch the recording! This was followed by an equally painful version of 'Wonderwall'. The students loved it, despite not having a clue what we were singing about!



We then went on a tour of the school where we answered questions the students had and signed autographs (we are really celebrities now!) We exchanged questions and answers and were shocked to find out that there was a class of 170 students! Mr Butterworth would have a heart attack! We then spent the remainder of the afternoon chilling out, recovering from the experience and signing more autographs when getting stopped for them in the street! Another amazing day.

En relaxant sur le bord de la mer
Une femme indienne relaxe sur les bords de l'ocean a Pondicherry. La plupart du bord de mer est rocailleux. La rue qui longe l'ocean est pietonne tous les jours entre 18h00 et 7h00 le lendemain matin.
Alors que je suis entoure de gens qui n'ont rien mais qui sont ben, moi qui a tout, je suis malheureux comme un pou. C'etait mon humeur du moment et plutot que de me brancher sur la gratitude en voyant la pauvrete qui m'entoure et les gens qui sont heureux malgre tout, je me juge trois fois plus pour etre malheureux malgre tout. Quand je dis ""je me juge"", on s'entend, c'est plutot ""l'ego me juge"". L'ego panique, capote, rue dans les brancards et me ressers de vieux disques du genre ""je ne vaux rien"" ""qu'est-ce que je fais ici"" ""j'ai tout essaye et j'arrive pas a etre heureux"" ""C'est quoi ma voie, bordel de merde!! Qu'est-ce que je peux faire qui me branche et me passionne???"" ""Plus rien ne me fais rien..."" etc. etc., je viens deja de lui donner trop de place alors je vais arreter ca la. J'ai beau avoir des messages d'un de mes amis : ""Tes doutes viennent de toi... tes reponses aussi"" ou de Pondicherry avec des hotels au noms tels que : ""Gratitude"" ou ""Surrender"", l'ego est en furie et ne veut rien entendre. Je fais un appel a l'aide que la plupart aurons
camera?
Le plus petit de ces enfants m'a salue puis il m'a fait un signe de prise de photoen me demandant : ""Camera?"". Bon, euh, ok! si tu insiste!!!
vu et j'essai de me calmer ensuite.

Je m'installe dans un cafe/boulangerie/patisserie/resto de l'endroit que j'aime bien, le Bon Bakes (les indiens prononcent Bonn Bakes) L'ambiance est bonne, la bouffe et les cuisiniers sont a vus a travers une vitre, on peut donc voir que l'hygiene est impeccable et je mange sans me demander si ca va me rendre malade. Je lis le livre ""mange, prie, aime"" d'Elizabeth Gilbert et je suis enfin dans la partie ""Inde"" du voyage de l'auteure. Je me dis que je ne veux pas lire ce bout, moi qui me prends deja trop au serieux et ce bout etant consacre a ses sejours a l'ashram, a pratiquer la meditation et la devotion 24 heures sur 24. Heureusement, l'auteure a un bon sens de l'humour. Voici des extraits qui m'ont permis de dedramatiser ma situation :

- Il semblerait que je n'arrive pas a imposer l'immobilite a mon esprit. Je m'en suis ouverte un jour a un moine indien et il m'a dit : ""C'est vraiment triste que vous soyez la seule personne de l'humanite a rencontre se probleme"" Puis il m'a cite la Bhagavad-Gita, le plus sacre des anciens textes yogiques: ""O Krishna!
Juste comme ca...
Un des petits messages affiches dans la rue, juste comme ca... Puis en se promenant dans la ville on voit des boutiques ou des cafes nommes surrender ou grattitude...
Que l'esprit est agite, turbulent, tetu et inflexible! Je le trouve aussi difficile a dompter que le vent.""

Puis, un peu plus loin, l'auteure raconte :

- Quand je demande a mon esprit de se tenir tranquille, c'est etonnant avec quelle rapidite il va 1) Sombrer dans l'ennui 2) Ceder a la colere 3) A la depression 4) A l'anxiete ou 5) A tout ce qui precede.

Et plein d'autres perles du genre. Elle y cite aussi des suggestions donne par d'autres gurus ou moines pour occuper l'esprit de facon plus saine, avec des mantras par exemple, ce que j'ai essaye avec un bon succes.

J'ai aussi prie beaucoup beaucoup beaucoup pour mettre fin a ce desespoir et cette colere irrationnelle.

Quand je parle de colere irrationnelle, fallait me voir, assis tranquille au Bon Bakes, alors qu'un groupe de jeunes indiens s'installent et bavardent autour de moi. Ils se payent un festin et l'un deux, horreur sans nom, SAPE!!! ""Tabarnak! Ferme ta gueule quand tu mange!!!"" Que je me dis. Je suis entoure de pauvrete incroyable et de richesse spirituelle tout aussi incroyable. Je vis un reve de longue date mais la:""Toi, tu SAPES EN
Riviere de dechets
Cette riviere de dechets debouche directement sur une des rares plages de pondicherry ou les pecheurs mettent leur bateau en mer mais drolement, personne ne s'y baigne....
MANGEANT ET CA M'ENEEEEEEEEEEERRRRRRRVVVVVVVVVVEEEEEEE!!!!."" Tout en me rendant compte du ridicule d'une rage disproportionne pour un incident aussi banal, je n'arrive pas a calmer l'ego. Dieu merci, a peu pres 120 prieres de la serenite d'affile ont fini par ramener le calme et la paix dans mon esprit.

Faudrait aussi que je vous parle des plages de Pondicherry. Je voulais vous en parler en vous mentionnant a quel point il est impossible de se baigner ici. Le bord de la mer est ici constitue uniquement de roches enormes mis a part quelques petits endroits sablonneux, ou les pecheurs debarques leurs bateaux de fortunes. Ces petites plages sont a l'embouchures de rivieres de dechets qui ne sont pas trop invitantes. J'en etais a ces reflexions quand je decidai de me rendre un peu plus loin sur le bord de la mer, plus loin que la route le permet. Puis j'ai vu une plage un peu plus grande, sans riviere de dechets, ou plusieurs jeunes indiens se baignaient. Apres une torture de questionnement, surtout a savoir si je prenais un grand risque en laissant mes pantalons et mon passeport sur la plage, je decide que j'ai grand besoin de joie et
Touristes devant Gandhi
Des touristes se font prendre en photo devant la statue de Gandhi
je fonce dans la mer. Waaahouuuuuuu!!!! Je m'amuse un bon moment avant de laisser l'ego prendre les rennes de ma vie: ""O! Malheur! Meme ca, ca ne me rends pas heureux!!! Que je suis seul au moooooonnnnnnndddddeeeee!"" Mais ca, c'etait avant mon appel a l'aide, avant mes lectures et avant mes meditations. La je suis plus calme et je ne reviendrai pas la-dessus question de ne pas reveiller la bete qui dort. Chhhuuuuuuutttt! L'ego est un petit emmerdeur parfois 😉

Ah la la!!! J'aurais tellement de choses a vous raconter mais la j'en ai oublie le trois quarts. Coudonc, en attendant, admirez les photos de Pondicherry, une ville bien douce pour un voyageur comme moi.

<p>After 4 days of hard grind, a day of rest and recuperation was gratefully received.</p><p>The early morning crew went out for their 6am run. Even at this time the temperture must be 70-80 degrees.</p><p>After breakfast, we all went on a tour of a local temple. None of us were really prepared for the size and majesty of this holy building. We wandered around it for 45 minutes and were all moved and impressed by the scale, craftmanship and reverence in which the indigenous people held it. A great visit was topped off by a meeting with an elephant. For a few ruppees donation he would bless an individual by taking their note in his trunkand then resting it on their head. Unfortunately for Jake he sneezed at him instead.</p><p>After the temple, the group had a chance to do some shopping. A number of the group purchased saris. Quite a few of the males in the group, bought lightweight Indian cotton suits, which they later wore to dinner much to the chef's delight. As the only westerners in sight, we continued to be looked at with a mixture of curiosity, delight and friendliness.</p><p>One of the best bits about the trip so far has been how the students have really taken the initiative in making the most of the experience. A group of the lads had organised a cricket training session for some of the deaf students earlier in the week. Today they organised another 2 hour session in their free-time, which again was a great success. Other students have organised football games against the locals or have taken it upon themselves to offer their help in teaching lessons, such as art. Some have taken it upon themselves to start their working day earlier, beginning at 8am rather than at 10am.</p><p>The feedback from the Principal of the school and from our host has been hugely positive and they've been blown away by how much the students have achieved in such a short amount of time. Praise indeed.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will be visiting a local girls school. 7,000 students attend - over 4 times that of Overton. Pretty daunting in itself. Even more nerve-racking is the fact that we will be attending their whole-school assembly and have been invited to sing a song as part of the assembly. Tonight has been desperately spent learning the words to 'O Happy Day' and fine-tuning our performance. Fingers crossed...</p>

For the past few days some of the group have been rather insanely getting up at 6am to go on a 2.5 miles run around Tirunelveli. They assure the rest of us that it is great fun and a fantastic way to wake up in the morning. The rest of us are unconvinced and wallow in the bliss of extra sleep.

The projects continue and we begin to really see huge improvements to both sites. Whilst the toll of 4 days of physical labour was beginning to show, the group completed some really impressive work.

At Chittenden Deaf School all the hard work scraping, sanding and smashing paid off as work began on plastering and painting. There was still some pretty tough concrete that needed smashing off the walls. Our crack destruction crew managed to complete the job successfully, much to the surprise and delight of our Indian hosts. Only minor incident was when a water pipe got cracked during the smashing. Needless to say it was one of the teachers who let the side down. The Indian builders were hugley impressed with the work and that made the pain of our bountiful blisters much easier to take.

At the local school, work on the kitchen was progressing speedily. The kitchen complex has reached 10 feet and the Indian foreman is now in a position to fit the roof. Wndows were fitted and a concrete floor was expertly laid by the group. This involved a lot of standing in the liquid cement and squishing it, much like a wine-maker would do with grapes. The majority of the brickwork has now been completed. Miss Barraclough and Miss Treagus were getting ready to tell the groups what they needed to do when they first got on site. Whilst they were talking together about this, the students had already organised themselves and had begun to get on with starting the day. It was great to see them really starting to take the initiative.

After dinner, we had a quiz against another English school. They won. But as Rob posited, the true victory is that we've completed much more work on our building projects than they have. Let's hope that this competitive edge continues and that we continue to maintain the superb work ethic demonstrated so far.

Tomorrow, a rest day at last and a chance to visit a local temple and do a bit of retail therapy.

Friday - One half of the group continued working on building a kitchen area for a local school. The local press got wind of our endeavours and sent a photographer down to the school to see what was occuring. Celebrity status ensued and a few of the group let their newfound fame go to their heads by trying to hog the camera. The party's divas have now been identified and will be outed at the celebration dinner back in Sutton (14th Sept). Work went really well and the kitchen went from little more than two feet tall to a whopping six feet.

The second group continued to renovate one of the building at Chittenden Deaf School, where we are staying. This meant a great deal of physically demanding jobs, such as smashing plaster of walls, scraping paint off the structure and sanding it down. One thing in particular put the trip in perspective. On the first floor balcony is a bed and a small locked chest. It's pretty much the life's possessions of one of the deaf wardens who works at the school. He was an orphan from birth and was taken in by the school. He has lived there for over 50 years and lives on a metal bed (no matress) with a pillow and a few items locked away in a small chest. It really did help to hit home how lucky we all are.

Both groups worked tirelessly and had some downtime in the late afternoon to head into town to buy some local delicacies - Pringles, Coke and Dairy Milk. One more Project day and then we get a day's break on Sunday.

Government of Pondicherry War Memorial
Un commemoratif de la guerre par le gouvernement de Pondicherry.... Brrrr...
Voici un bel exemple d'ironnie.

Je dans le train entre Vizianagaram et Pondicherry. J'ai la couchette du haut, mon sac a dos est donc logiquement sur le sol, sous la couchette du bas. Pour une raison X, il n'y a aucun anneau auquel je peux attacher une chaine, mon sac-a-dos et un cadenas. Alors que je descends de ma couchette, je pense que si je me fais voler mon sac-a-dos, la chose la plus importante a l'interieur ce sont mes anti-depresseurs. Je les mets donc dans ma poche de pantalon avant d'aller aux toilettes, pensant les mettre dans mon petit sac, sur ma couchette, au retour. Je fais ce que je dois au toilette, remonte mes pantalons et sacre alors que je vois mes medicaments tomber dans le trou qui mene directe sur la track du chemin de fer. Oui oui, si vous n'avez pas lu mon autre voyage en train je vous l'apprends, les toilettes debouches directements sur le chemin de fer dans les trains. J'ai donc des crottes un peu partout sur les chemins de fer de l'Inde, emouvant n'est-ce pas? Grace a moi, y'a aussi une vache qq part qui est plus joyeuses que les autres ;p
Ocean's view
Un pere et sa fille sur le bord de l'ocean


Dieu merci, je n'ai pas eu de difficultes a trouve ce medicament a Pondicherry, me voila rassure et tres heureux pour la vache que j'aurai involontairement aide.

Pondicherry est une toute petite ville mais, fouille-moi pourquoi, il y a quand meme 700 000 habitants ici. Il est facile de s'y retrouver et je commence deja a bien connaitre une petite partie de la ville. Evidemment, je prefere la partie ""propre"" de la ville, a l'Est du canal, plutot que celle de l'Ouest, qui elle, ressemble pas mal a toutes les autres villes indiennes, mis a part quelques bons petits restos. Il faut d'ailleurs faire attention dans ces restos, on y paie parfois plus cher que ce que ca vaut, mais un peu de ""luxe"", des fois, ca fait du bien.

Je vous donne une idee. 1 dollar canadien equivaut a plus ou moins 50 roupies indiens. Mais pour reellement connaitre la valeur des repas, faut comparer avec le prix des repas d'ici. Je payais, a Delhi et a Vizianagaram, en moyenne entre 200 et 300 roupies par repas. Rendu a 300 roupies, c'etait soit une pizza de chez Domino ou un repas gargantuesque a l'hotel SVN Lake
Vu du Ayodhia Bhavan Guest House
Le Ayodhia Bhavan Guest House est mon lieu de residence actuelle. Cette vue est prise du toit. C'est quand meme pas mal, non?
Palace de Vizianagaram. Ici, dans deux restos jusqu'a maintenant, j'ai paye entre 400 et 500 roupies. L'un, etait un pizzeria au four a bois, alors ce n'est pas si mal, mais pas si hot non plus... et l'autre, c'etait le Club, un resto avec toute sorte de bonnes nourritures. Moi, j'avais pris les pates carbonnara, pas mal du tout. J'avais aussi, dans les deux cas, pris un ""drink"" non-alcoolise genre jus d'ananas ou limonade epicee. Donc j'ai contribue a faire grimper la facture.

Cote hotel, je payais entre 800 et 2000 roupies pour une chambre a air climatise. Un bon prix pour une chambre sans air clim aurait ete 300 roupies.

Mais voila ou ca devient interessant. Je reste dans une residence de l'ashram qui me coute 150 roupies la nuit seulement. C'est propre, un peu a l'exterieur de la ville et il y a un ventillateur bien efficace au plafond. De plus, il ne fait pas aussi chaud a Pondicherry qu'a Vizianagaram ou Delhi. A peine 36 degres aujourd'hui...

De plus, j'ai achete des coupons pour la salle a manger de l'Ashram. Ces coupons donnent droit a 3 repas par jour pour 20 roupies seulement. Faut
Toujours le toit du Guest House
A l'autre bout du toit, l'ocean est toujours en Arriere plan.
dire qu'ailleurs, quand je payais moins de 100 roupies pour un seul repas, j'estimais que j'avais fait un bon deal. Bon, ces repas ne sont pas hyper consistent mais ils font la job, et au pire, je complete a l'exterieur. A 20 roupies, meme pour un seul repas, si je complete ailleurs je paie quand meme pas tres cher.

Soit dit en passant, ce n'est pas l'endroit ideal pour une retraite silencieuse. Premierement parce que les repas sont bien loin du lieu ou je reside actuellement et l'Ashram egalement. Pour aller soit a l'Ashram ou a la salle a manger, je dois marcher un kilometre et une fois la, je suis en ville, avec tous le bruit, la sollicitation et le traffic que ca implique. Deuxiemement, parce que meme mon lieu de residence, que l'on ma recommande pour ma retraite de silence puisque c'etait ""tranquille"", n'est pas si tranquille que ca. Il y a moins de traffic mais le toit, d'ou on m'a dit que je pouvais voir l'ocean, est en renovation. Ce qui fait qu'alors que je me repose dans ma chambre, j'entends soudainement, sur ma tete, de grands coups de marteaux. Heureusement, renovation ici, au moins, ne
L'envers...
Ca, quand je me tourne a partir de l'endroit ou j'ai pris la photo precedente, c'est ca que je vois. En plus simple, c'est ce qu'il y a derriere ""l'hotel""
rime pas avec machinerie lourdes. Tout de meme... Et les corneilles remplacent allegrement les klaxons. Ici, il y a des corneilles comme chez nous on a des mouettes ou des pigeons. Il y en a plein, elles ont le corps et le derriere du crane gris, le reste est noir, pis elles se font aller, semble-t-il, 24 heures sur 24.

Mais 9 heures de silence m'ont suffit pour l'instant. Je ne doute pas du bienfait d'une telle pratique mais moi je capotais plus que d'autres choses. En ecrivant, apres mes neuf heures, j'ai constate que pour moi, qui cherche a connaitre du monde et avoir du fun plutot que de m'isoler, la pratique du silence est loin d'etre recommandable 😉

Mais j'aime bien avoir acces a des endroits silencieux. L'ashram et la salle a manger (deux batisses differentes) sont des endroits ou le silence est de mise. Allez donc savoir, les seuls gamins bruyants de l'endroit sont venus s'installer un moment devant moi alors que je tachais de profiter du silence de l'ashram, anyway...

Je ne peux vous fournir de photo, il est strictement interdit de prendre des photographies en ces lieux. Toutefois, si vous cherchez dans
Le cote
Toujours sur le toit...
la section ""images"" sur google et que vous taper ""Sri aurobindo ashram"" ou encore ""Sri aurobindo ashram dinning hall"" vous allez voir les batisses de l'exterieur. Pour voir autour de quoi tout ce passe a l'ashram, vous devez rechercher ""Sri aurobindo samadhi"". Il s'agit de la tombe de Sri Aurobindo et de la mere. Cette tombe est recouverte d'un magnifique arrangement floral. Autour d'elle, il y a 5 soirs sur cette, une meditation collective. C'est aussi autour d'elle que les gens se recueillent en silence. Qui est Sri Aurobindo? Qui est la Mere? Sri Aurobindo est un sage de la fin du 19e et debut du 20e siecle. Au depart, fotement implique dans les journaux et en politique, il est le premier a avoir reclamme l'independance de l'Inde, en 1907 je crois. Quelques annees plus tard, alors age d'un peu plus de trente ans, il se consacre uniquement a l'elevation du Soi. La Mere est sa disciple la plus devouee. Sri Aurobindo propose ce qu'il appelle un yoga integral qui, si je resume en mes mots, est base sur ""etre ici, grounde, dans la realite plutot que de flyer spirituellement"". Il n'y a pas de meditations compulsives (c'est ainsi que
Cote crade
Ca, c'est l'autre cote de la residence, le cote un peu moins charmant disons. J'ai apercu la-dedans, l'autre nuit, l'un des plus gros rats que j'ai vu de ma vie!
c'est ecrit dans un pamphlet) ou specifiques, ni de mantras prescrits. Chacun procede a son rythme et a la facon qui lui convient le mieux. La seule chose qu'il prescrit, est l'abandon total au Divin. Genial non? Il a ecrit plein de livres aussi mais je crois que je vais me concentre sur cette partie ""simple and stupid"", abandon total au Divin.

Voila qui est Sri Aurobindo, en tres tres bref.

Mon blogue, lui, ne l'est pas.

Alors que j'etais en train d'etre frustre pcq tous-les-indiens-qui-me-parlent-et-qui-sont-gentils-avec-moi-le-sont-parce-qu'ils-veulent-m'arnaquer, l'Inde m'a fait un petit clin d'oeil. Je marchais dans la partie plus rurale de la ville, ou je reside, j'apercois un jeu de Karam sur le sol. Le Karam, c'est tres simple, c'est la version indienne des pichenottes. Les seules differences etant que les rondelles sont pleines, la surface un peu plus grande et la zone de tir for restreintes. Bref, je regarde le jeu et celui qui le possede et il me dit brievement : ""Karam, want to play?"" (Karam, tu veux jouer?) Bien sur! Alors il appelle sa famille et ses amis. Nous nous installons a quatre. L'un deux m'adresse la parole en francais, il est parisien. Ils m'offrent une boisson gazeuse locale delicieuse. Ils m'offrent aussi a manger mais je n'ose pas et je passe un moment for agreable avec eux.

C'est la que je dis que l'Inde est une grande blageuse. Voyez, l'autre jour, je mentionnais les serveurs betes a mon hotel, dont le sourrire semble proscrit. Ben le lendemain, meme hotel, meme resto, un serveur me fait un grand sourrire en me reconnaissant et ensuite, le ""food manager"" (gerant de bouffe) me questionne, avec un grand sourrire, sur ce que j'ai mange en me demandant mon appreciation, puis il discute un moment avec moi avec un large sourrire tout le long. Bref, je me plains d'une chose et l'instant suivant, l'Inde me fait un clin d'Oeil en voulant dire ""Tu disais quoi deja?"".

Ce qui est moche ici parfois, c'est qu'en dehors des femmes serveuses au restaurant ou caissieres dans un petit stand genre depanneur, les femmes ne m'adressent pas la parole. Pis la, je parle meme pas de flirt, je parle juste de femmes qui m'adresserait la parole comme les hommes le font, il semble que ce soit interdit pour une femme d'etre amicale envers un homme sauf s'il est dans sa famille ou s'il est son conjoint.

Vas-y! Inde! Prouve moi le contraire ;p

So far we have had a brilliant time. All the youngpeople have now experienced working in a bakery and we are now completing two building projects. These consist of, a kitchen and toilet at a local primary school in a near by village and a warden accommodation at the deaf school.



It is very different here, and we feel like we should be on the 'Only way is India' as we have acquired celebrity status for no reason! The food is amazing and everyone has been adventerous at trying everything. We are well looked after in the school we are staying at, and everyone is very appreciative of the work we are doing. The boys have been busy setting up lots of cricket and football tournaments. Although they are one nil down after losing against 400 Indian students!



We have now all ventured into the local town and have experienced how manic it is! The internet cafe only has five computers so if you haven't heard from your son/daughter yet it will be that they haven't had a chance to get in there yet, or they have been too busy having a fabulous time, many of them saying the internet can wait until they get home! Yes really!



We are now off to have a sign language lesson, followed by dinner and then practise for our performance on Sunday to 7000 students! We will update again when we can, and hopefully add some pictures if we work out how to on these computers!

Hi,



Sorry for the delay in updating - this is the first chance we have had to get on the internet. We have all arrived safely after a long journey. The train ride was amazing and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We have been very busy visiting the school, playing games with the students etc. We have started on the project today, whilst a group worked in the bakery. Everything is fine, and everyone is well. We will hopefully be able to update more regularly from now on.

1: Enroute to Jog Falls 173 secs
2: Sirsi to Goa 204 secs


Jog Falls
We decided to go for a vacation tour on June 2012. Our children were interested to visit some new places. We searched the blog post about Goa. Under the blog post, Goa was described beautifully. So we decided to head over to Goa. Goa is located 950Kms from Kancheepuram. We left our home at 4.45 AM on 17.06.12. We had our breakfast at 7.50 AM (A2B Restaurant, in between Krishnagiri and Hosur). After 45 minutes break, we continued our journy and reached Bangalore NICE road at 9.45 AM. On blog post, we found two different routes from Bangalore to Goa. The first route leads to Goa via Thumkur, Haveri and Sirsi, the second route leads via Thumkur, shimioga, Jog falls and Kumta. We decided to choose the second route, as we had planned to visit Jog falls which is India's the second highest plunge falls. On the way to Jog falls we had our unpalatable lunch at Tiptur at 12.45 PM. We continued our journey and reached Jog falls at 6.30 PM.

Experience at jog falls:

After we reached the jog falls, we had some discomfort in enjoying the pleasant environment because heavy rainfall. Out of enthusiasm, we ran
Jog Falls
out in the heavy rainfall and we were not aware of the great disappointment. Due to the clouds, we were not able to enjoy the clear view of falls. We decided to take some photos and quit the place. Before leaving the place, we had a break to refresh on the nearby restaurant. After our refreshment, surprisingly we found the clear view of falls. Immediately we ran to see the cloudless falls and we were very glad to see the falls after many disturbances. We took many photos with our children and we spent the pleasant evening there. Then we started our journey to Goa without knowing the inconvenience.

Thrilling dark night forest travel:

On the way to Goa, when we were crossing Billigi at 9.00Pm,we found some people from the forest department. They informed us that they had blocked the way for the safety of night travellers and asked us to take diversion towards Sirsi which is 60 Kms away from that place. We were in the midst of dark and thick forest. Because of heavy rainfall, we had not found anyone on the road. Fortunately, we had our mobile with GPS facility attached in our car.
Jog Falls
We started to move slowly with the help of GPS. An hour later, we found two people on a car. We decided to seek help from those people to find a resort for night stay. When we enquired them, they advised us not to stay there and directed to move towards Sirsi which is 60kms from the place. After 2 hours of long journey we reached Sirsi at 11PM. There we found a small lodge and had stayed there in order to stop night travel in the dark forest.

Pleasant stay at Goa:

Next day morning, we felt fresh to take 400 Kms of journey to Goa. Actually, we planned to reach Goa before1.00 PM. We started our journey at 7.00AM from Sirsi. When we were reaching Kumta, we found Kamat restaurant and we had a delicious breakfast. We started our journey after the break and reached Panaji at 2.30 PM. When we were reaching Panaji our children liked to stay in a beach resort. After a long search, we found a resort named as O PESCADOR Beach Resort at Dona Paula with a room rent of Rs.2000 + tax per night. We kept our luggage and went
Jog Falls
for shopping on the evening itself.



On 19.6.12, we had a pleasant morning with our children on the resort swimming pool. After that we moved for site seeing. First, we went for Miramer beach, here, our children played and enjoyed the beach park. Then, we visited Aguda Fort which is 20 Kms away from the beach. We found many people were enjoying the site of the fort. Here we went for shopping. At last we tried to see St. Francis Xavier Church which is the oldest church at old Goa. When we reached there, we found that the church was locked and we had not known the opening time of the church. In order to know that we enquired some people who were on the nearby bus stand. Unfortunately, we were not able understand their language and we missed the opportunity. Finally we decided to get back to our staying place, on the way to the resort, we found Basilica of Bom Jesus at old Goa. There I got down and bought a Rosary for my niece as gift who is going to appear for the 12th standard examination.



According to our plan, we
O Pescador Beach Resort, Dona Paula, Goa
started our journey towards Mangalore at 12.00 PM. On the way to Mangalore, we enjoyed many beautiful sceneries and had reached Mangalore at 10.00 PM. As we had already searched the Kumar International restaurant through Internet, we didn’t strain much to find the place to stay. We booked an AC room with a cost of Rs.1030. Next day morning at 10.00 AM we went for the shopping mall City Center Plaza which is Asia’s second largest shopping mall. We purchased some apparel for our children and started to move slowly towards Kanchipuram through Bangalore. We reached our home at 2.00 AM. Of course, the journey was too tiresome but we didn’t feel because of our children. It was a pleasant memorable and remarkable trip.

May 18th 2012

What is it with ‘non-veg’ restaurants and sleazy rowdy men? Why is it that if an un-escorted girl enters a ‘non-veg’ restaurant post 6pm, then SHE is what’s being served! At least in India.

Well appetites apart, Coimbatore Railway Station has a variety of lodges and accommodation for nearly every type of traveler. I, being one of the lesser value ones, chose a single-occupancy (very fancy word for a not-so-fancy place) room at Raja Lodge, just behind KR Restaurant (a landmark here), for Rs 300/- per night. If I must rate it then I’d give it a 1.5 on 10.

Actually, it depends, if you’re an Indian sportsman then it’s a 6.5, but if not then it’s 1.5. I think every Indian sportsman has stayed in conditions far far worse and even appreciated some of those. We’ve traveled for competitions unreserved in foul smelling general compartments, slept on baggage instead of beds, and bathed in bathrooms with taps for showers and curtains for doors (with holes in them too). So this place is really not that bad…in comparison.

But what was great, even for non-Indian non-sportsmen, was where I stayed in Ooty. Montauban Guest House – once the residence of a French designer called Ettines (after whom the road that the guest house is on is called Ettines Road) who lived in Ooty in the 1920s (Sorry, but that’s about all the history I can deal with for one place) – is my favourite place to stay. After staying there for 6 nights (I could have stayed there for 6 months) at Rs 650/- per night, I have decided to dedicate a few good words to the place.

Its manicured gardens and lawns gives it, and therefore you, a very cared-for air. And although you won’t find on-call butler-suave room-service, if, with kindness, you approach them for any task, it will be diligently and efficiently done ASAP. The rooms are cozy and non-musty smelling – not a spec of dust to be found. They come with proper beds (clean blankets and all), drinking water, tissue, soap, a writing table (with a chair and that’s worth a mention in this country) and a sideboard with plenty of drawers. I love drawers, you never know what you find in them. Oh, and the bathroom is huge and spacious, and tiled, and clean, and western style – with a working flush!!!

I have, now reached the fag end of my tapioca journey, and my jeans have turned from blue to brown. But if you do happen to book a room in one of these lodges opposite the Coimbatore railway station, always try for the top-most floors. You get less peeping-toms, that way.

Dinner was at KR Restaurant, where a sign hiding behind a couple of bicycles reads “Please safe your own vehicles yourself”, and where you will frequently find customers wiping their freshly washed hands and mouth on the curtain that separates the washroom from the restaurant, and where ‘calli flower masala dosas’ are on the menu, and where, if you’re as lucky as I was, you might get to witness your waiter scratching his private parts while he waits to take your order.

If I may say so, it was almost as if he was trying to pick out something rather troublesome quite deeply buried in there. I’m not sure if he was quite so successful, though.

And, if all that hasn’t tempted you enough to step right in, then I’ll also add, that the food wasn’t bad. Do not try the Chinese. It is, and I’m not saying this sarcastically, the best restaurant on that block. 3 on 10.

But during my 6 days in Ooty, I ate at very few restaurants – I’m not as adventurous with food as I am with accommodation, I’m afraid. One which I consistently ate at is Kurunjis – a tiny outdoor restaurant on the main road about 100 meters from Charing Cross Junction – serves clean, yum, cheap and hygienic food, with very courteous waiters. 10 on 10. Another nice place (I have heard) is Shinkows (Chinese).

In Conoor, where my Tapioca friends were staying in their cozy and comfy homestay, I ate at a Chinese restaurant called Dragon something. For one thing the waiter was a young Mongloid-featured lad with a very funky hairdo. That was enough to pull me in. Mongloid men with funky hairdos are one of my all-time favourite dishes. And although he wasn’t on the menu, the food we did order, was quite good; better than the supposedly French restaurant called La Belle Vie where the waiter actually apologized for bringing the dish late because he’d “dropped it” on the way. That’s 3.5 on 10 for the Belle and 6.5 for the Dragon. We topped that with ice cream and hot chocolate from the café coffee day next door and that was excellent 8.5 for CCD.

So, two crisp Rava Roast Dosas, one itchy waiter, one filthy curtain and a safety sign later (of course minus the calli flower dosa) I walked back to my little concrete cave and called it a night.

In the morning I caught my train back to Bombay which started its journey 2 hours behind schedule and changed two engines en-route making us a total of 6 hours late by the time we got into Bombay. Welcome to India.

Leaving Sarnath
On the 15th of March we flew from Kolkata to Chennai (but missed our connecting flight, obviously. This is India after all). After splashing out for the next flight down (with the so-called 'cheap' Indian airlines....) we arrived in Chennai and went straight to Pondicherry. Pondi is an old French town on the southern East shore of India in the state of Tamil Nadu. We saw a different India here: Shops, cafes (with real coffee!), friendly people (finally), less hassling, laid back culture and even rubbish bins on the streets.

We stayed about a week due to being extremely feverish and sick. Our room was in a very nice ashram park guest house by the sea (run by the rudest, most pathetically fundamentally religious rule-abiding morons in the world).

We then moved on to Thrivandrum in the southern most state of India, Kerala. This is the only communist state in India, and funnily enough, by far the richest, cleanest and nicest part of the countrty. It is also the land of tea plantations and spice farms. We ended up in Kovalam, a beautiful beach paradise on the most southern west coast.

We lived in our own rather large
Calcutta airport
Crazy flamethrower guy smoking up whole building at 3am to kill all the insects
top-quality modern flat right by the beach for about four quid a night and got to know most of the locals. And finally, we got to go swimming everyday. There are loads of tourists down there, but the place hasnt been destroyed yet, and we were able to see the real India in near by villages as well.

Next, we traveled up to Varkala beach: much the same, very nice, etc. And a guy selling great coffee in some beach cafe that played loads of Beatles and Zeppelin.

An amazing experience was rowing in the Aleppey's backwaters, this huge water area among rice field and palm trees where people actually live using handmade kayaks to go shopping. The most relaxing day, looking at the boat houses, hosted by the captain's family and eating the local thali meal on the banana leaf.

Then we braved the unimaginably dangerous, twisting and grinding two-meter wide roads up to the mountains in the north of Kerala to the tea plantations. We reached a town at about 2000 meters above sea level. How we survived that trip I do not know.

After visiting an 8'000 year old cave and almost being
The bus trip from Chennai to Pondicherry
Lush, green and wild.
trampled to death by hoards of impatient Indian tourists, we headed on....

We took some kind of bus - train - bus -train journey to Goa: India's most notorious party area. Now here's the lowdown: Southern Goa, Palolem beach: We spent a week here in our own little ramshack hut: it was probably our favourite place in India until now: beautiful palm tree beaches, wild as hell with thunderstorms that you never believed you'd survive. Really friendly chilled out people and UNBELIEVEABLY cheap beer: about 40p for a small bottle or 50p for a huuuuge bottle. Needles to say we were wasted non-stop. Just kidding. Highlights: watching wild dolphins from a restaurant while having breakfast, and seeing massive sea eagles dive down to catch fish while on a river cruise with our new German friends.

Now, we are in northern Goa: terrible, awful area totally raped by tourists ( mostly Russians and brits setting up Yorkshire Pudding bars), loud awful music (no Goa Trance by the way- none at all, anywhere!). We are near the Old Goa city however, which being an old Portuguese colony, has been rather interesting.

See photos for more. As I write this,

Down here in the south people be usin' the voodoo and them devil spells...! Every shop, at least.
we are awaiting out next trip up to Pune where my Grandmother was born and will then continue to Udaipur - Delhi. Then our India sojourn will come to an end: sadly, as well as FINALLY.

Inaugaration
The Meatless Travelers
The first day of the Ricksaw Run....

Festivities started off at 10:00 AM with a parade of rickshaws around Fort Cochin. A few speeches, including the Chancellor of Cochin, later was the official inaugaration and we were off by 11:00AM!

After an hour of navigating around Cochin city traffic, we finally hit the Highway. Inspite of today being Easter Sunday some spots still had significant bus and truck traffic. Outside of the inevitable damage we are constantly inundating our clutch with, we are trying to ensure our Rickshaw is getting the TLC it deserves with regular stops, ""petrol/oil breaks"" and checking of air pressure. We definitely underestimated the curiosity and excitement of the Indian population when seeing us drive around in a rickshaw, with some cars driving alongside just to get a better look

Tomorrow we set out early for Bangalore, with the goal of reaching there before 6:00 PM

Sorry for this late backup, but here it is!

My friend Sepp arrived in the early morning on my birthday, 23.1., in Chennai. Outside the airport it is (like everywhere) extremely loud due to the much traffic that wants to go to or away from the airport. For people that dont want to flight it was forbidden to get into the airport or you have to pay a visitor ticket. Of course, I didnt buy such a ticket, so I had to wait outside. I had the feeling that Sepp was the last passenger who came out. Immediately a taxi driver came to us. We said we want to have a prepaid taxi. He said, yes, of course he is a prepaid taxi driver, 450Rupees. Very funny. If he were a driving a prepaid taxi, he would not have to look for the passengers and besides that I had found out before that it costs only 300 something. So we went to the pre paid taxi stand. The taxi driver joined us. It is very interesting to see that in India they all work together if it is about getting some money from tourists. The guy at the taxi stand
Photo 63
laughed at me as I said that it costs only 300 something, and he said we have to go with the driver and pay 450. Since it was in the middle of the night we didnt want to discuss and we went with the taxi. We had to pay after the ride. I think thats why it is called ""prepaid"" 😊 Sepp was quite afraid when he saw how the taxi driver was driving. Although there was almost nothing on the streets. I said he has to wait until the morning... The driver even didn't know the exact address of our hotel, but I recognized the area and said that we will find the hotel on our own. A Riksha-Driver said he will take us to the hotel for 20 Rupees. Since Sepp didnt want to walk in the middle of the night we agreed. But the Riksha driver had no idea where the hotel was either. However, we arrived finally at our hotel.

The next day many Rikshaw drivers were annoying us. Normally I am always on my bike, so that they don't get the idea to ask me if I need a ride. But here every driver
BILD1804
the family who wanted that we bring their story to the public
asked us and some even followed us for half an hour. When we wanted to ask someone for the way, we had to be careful that no riksha driver was seeing that because else they immediately offered their riksha:""Get in! I will bring you there!"" One riksha man was offering us to bring us to the beach for 10 Rupees. We agreed. He started to show us some temples and so. We said we just want to go to the beach. He said with a few Rupees extra he will do a city tour withe us. No, thank you. When we come to some shops our ride will be free. No, thank you. Just to the beach. That will be 50 Rupees. No, you said 10 Rupees. Nono, 10 Dollars. Thats bullshit. No ride in the city costs 10 Dollars. He said, no ride in the city costs 10 Rupees. So I wanted to get out, but Sepp still wanted to argue. After a while we got out and paid the 10 Rupees. The driver shouted after us: ""Crazy tourists!""And we said ""crazy Indian"". We had no idea where we were, but after a while we found the beach. We
BILD1805
heard that Chennai has the world's largest beach. To have a bath there is not recommended because many litter is put into the sea. We were happy that not only we but also Indian tourists were asked to buy some kitsch or to pay for a picture on a horse. We went to a bike shop area and looked for a bicycle for Sepp. They all had a standard single speed bike but could put some gears on it. Sepp chose a bike with six gears. We were said to take the bike the next afternoon. In the evening we celebrated the arrival of Sepp and my birthday in a bar.

The next day I tried to get new bars for my tent. But most people that we asked even didnt know what a tent is. Although we tried several shops and areas where the people,that did know what a tent was, sent us, we didnt find any tent or even tent bars. I was a bit surprised, that such a huge town (Chennai is the fourth biggest town in India) has no outdoor shops. That was in Teheran a bit different...

We met a homeless family. They
BILD1806
there were their old houses
wanted that we make fotos of them and the poor area. The man was trying to tell us something on Tamil which we couldnt understand. He couldnt speak English. As he recognized that I know some Hindi words he called excitedly his wife who was able to speak Hindi. But my Hindi was not good enough to understand her. He invited us for a tea. Actually we wanted to pay it but he was faster. He led us a whikle around the area and wanted that we make some pictures. After a while he found some youth who translated what he had tried to explain us.Their houses were broken down by the government with no chargeback. He wanted from us that we bring his story to the newspapers. We said that we are just tourists and no reporters. But I promised to make a note in my blog about this. He was very disappointed about that and was going away immediately. We felt very pity with him but we didnt know how to help him.

We were in the cycle shop to get Sepps bike. We were told that the guy who had to build the bike hasnt arrived

this day to work. Ahhh, okay???? One could think that they are not interested in our money. I would have gone to the next shop I think, but Sepp gave them a next chance and we wanted to take it tomorrow noon.No problem! (Of course not, how could we think that it could be a problem?)

In the evening we were in a dance performance.We weren't too excited so we went out in the pause again. There we met a funny old guy. Who said that we have to come tomorrow again, there will be a great singer. We went together to a restaurant. Two women also joined us, the guy was not very lucky with that. He said to me women always make only trouble. The one woman said all the time that she needs some money for the marriage of her daughter. We have heard before that there is still the problem in India that some families are still forced to ruin theirselves for the marriage of their daughter. Although it is already forbidden by law. The guy was ashamed of her and of the situation and wrote on a paper for me, that he has not

we met many people that liked Hitler and the Nazis
enough money for us all. I answered that it is no problem and that we can pay the bill.

The next day we were again at the bike shop. The bike was still not ready they couldnt get the gears on it. Sepp still wanted to stay at that shop and looked for a ready bike that costed much more. He finally bought a bike that was much more expensive than the original one but compared to Germany still really cheap, of course. They had no panniers there, so Sepp had to put his big backpack on the carrier.

We rode out of the city. Respect to Sepp who managed to ride through the mega city with a new bike much luggage, crazy traffic and left traffic. In the evening we stayed in a hotel called farm house which we thought would be quite cheap. No, it was not cheap, it was quite luxury. We said its too expensive but we asked if we can build up our tents there.They offerd us a room for 700R instead of 2800R so we took the room. In the hotel in Chennai I traded my Rough Guide to the new edition

local hooligans
which also was much thinner. I was happy about this, but in the evening I saw, why it was so thin: the pages of much chapters were pulled out.

We went to Mamallapuram where some historical buildings are. There were also many Indian tourists and they all wanted to make pictures from us.

We continued to Pondicherry which wis a french colony. The streets there are often still named in French. Pondicherry seemed to be a bit richer and cleaner as the cities that we have seen before. We stayed along the coast till Nagapattinam and had some nice baths in the Bay of Bengal. One night where we made rough camping a few youths said to us that there it is dangerous because of wild animals. We decided nevertheless to stay there. One guy was joining usand drank some brandy with us. But with the time he was getting more and more excited that it is so dangerous where we are. He was getting louder and started to ennoy us really. He could not really explain what the problem was and said something like: ""Dang-aaa!In-aaaa!Out-aaaa!Tent-aaaa!"" We didnt know how to get rid of them and went into

dance performance in Chennai
the tent. He went away but came a few minutes back.We shooed him away. But after a while he came back and was trying my helmet and twiddled with my bike. I was getting very angry and then he ran panically away. Maybe he just was drunken.

The next day Sepp was in a very bad mood. In his tent it was really wet and cold. He had stomach cramps and diarrhoea and could not sleep. I think the two flat tyres and the 4 kids watching him in the good morning show hasn't raised his mood I think...

We went from the Eastern coast to the Ghats in Western Tamil Nadu. On the way we visited some temples. Always the question: ""May I have a photo, please?"" What we think is quite crazy, is, that many people also want that we make a picture of them. We dont knw them, they dont know us, they wont get the pictures somewhen, but they like it to be photographed. In Trichy (actually Tiruchchirappalli, but since the English colonists couldnt pronounce it, it is just called Trichy) we saw a big nass of pilgrims coming to a little temple.They arrived
Photo 67
with drums and other music and with idols. They smashed coconuts in a container.We learned that from that day on starts a month for a special god of this temple. They start to pilgrimage from here and everywhere in South India to a town called Palani. The next days we have seen thousands of them. There are three main days where they arrive there.

We were often in restaurants. It is so tasty and cheap and there are so many restaurants, that it doesn't make sense to make your own food. There are sometimes so many staffs for so little guests that 5 staffs are standing around our table and give us new water or rice or anything thats going to finish. A meal costs often less than an Euro, so you cant imagine that so many people can live of that. On the other hand they are often confused if you order after the main course something else. They often bring the bill before we have finished and they have to change the bill a few times. As if they want to get rid of us and don't want our money. Others are smarter and recognize that we
Photo 68
eat a lot and offer us after the second portion much other stuff that we have to try. In total we are quite happy that we ride every day, so that we dont have to matter about the amount we eat.

Often when people see us building up our tents (actually, I had no place in India, where at least a few people saw me in the evening or in the morning camping), they warn us or say we cant stay there. They often cant explain why and the most time we insist on staying there and they go away. Maybe they just cannot understand that we rich tourists stay voluntarily at a uncomfortable place.

There are often lakes where the people wash theirselves. One night we were at such a lake and had a nice washing session. Two locals came there and said we cant wash there. They couldnt explain why and we thought now it is too late, we are already ready. The next morning I was there again. In the night I had diarrhoea and I was too slow so that some stuff got on my undertrousers. I wanted to wash me and my clothes
Photo 69
when we are agreed about the direction we can start:)
again in the lake and this time two locals warned me before I was getting in.This place was used as toilet place...Maybe this time it would be the right place for me 😊 but I went to the real washing place they showed me.

Sepp was often moaning that he is exhausted and cant anymore and needs some rest, but was the most time faster than me, especially when it was going upwards. We went to Kodaikanal in the Ghats. It was 2 days very steep upwards. The first day we asked for a hotel. ""In 4 km"". Okay, thats doable. After 5km there was a little village. We asked again. ""Just 5 km upwards."" We were not going for another 5km, so we asked if its not possible to sleep somewhere here. We could sleep behind a school. We thought that we won't be alone there for a long time. But we were not disturbed that night and the morning. We were told that the school starts at 8am, but at 8am nobody was there, so they probably just told us so to that we vanish in time. The landscape around Kodaikanal was amazing. But it also was
Photo 70
quite cold, we had to wear long clothes. In Kodaikanal there was very often power breakdown. In our hotel we had not hot water either, except from 7.30am-8am when we extra were awaked to fill the water in containers. Sepp was very cold in the night, for me it was okay, I had a warm sleeping back... We were offered a better room with electricity and hot water the whole day for 300R extra. We said we dont need the better room, but the next two days Sepp was a bit annoyed especially about not having warmth. We wondered what the locals are doing here in the evening or night. It is getting dark at about 6pm. We found one bar that also closes at 9 or so. One evening we saw a procession with loud music. we learned that there was celebrated the day of St. Thomas. Thats probably what they do. There are so many festivals and processions that you can make party nearly every time 😊 Downhill it was not so great fun as expected! The streets were very bad so that we had to ride very cautious. Due to a big road hole I got a
Photo 71
puncture. There were many monkeys who where quite aggressive. One monkey was offending and hitting me to get some cornflakes that I had in my hands.

We went to Palani where at this time millions of pilgrims come to a special temple. We were in the temple one day after the three main days but it was still very crowded. All the people wanted again that we make pictures of them. The next days we still saw on the roads thousands of pilgrims going to that place. They all are barefoot. The next day we saw a big river were many pilgrims were washing. It was amazing to see the coloured people and clothes in the water. Of course, we also had a bath there!

One evening we were in a bar were a guy joined us. He could not speak a full sentence in English and tried to talk to us in Tamil all the time. We spent him some beer. He was ordering some new drinks for us and wanted also to drink of it. We were a bit annoyed about him and we said to the staff, that he can sit next to us and
Photo 72
drink his beer, but he has to pay his own beer, that we want no common bill but an extra bill for him and for us. The bar man could nearly no English, too, just understood ""bill"" and brought us the bill. We hadn't the intention to pay at that moment and ordered more. After every order they brought us the updated bill. Quite funny!

There is a very tiny train going to another hill station in the ghats, Ooty (actually Udagamandalam, but as many other cities, there is a short form that everybody can pronounce 😊). This train seems to be just for tourists, also many Indian tourists. Although the train was starting very early in the morning, there was a party atmosphere, especially in the neighbour cabin. We didnt stay in Ooty because it is said to be similar to Kodaikanal and we had not so much time anymore. So we rode downhill on the same day. I think it was the steepest descent I ever had. We had to break all the time. That was not so fun.

We went to the Mudumalai National Park. When we arrived there we were first told that it
Photo 73
geckos everywhere
is not allowed to go there with two wheelers. But then we also could get inside and saw also many mopeds in the park. At dusk we made a private jeep tour and the next morning a official bus tour. Then we rode outside again and we realised that that is the best way to go through the park. You dont disturb the animal with your noisy vehicle and can see more animals.

After the park we wanted to go to the neighbour state Kerala. We decided to do a night ride. At dusk we saw a bar and we thought that we can drink a beer first. There were two rooms, one without A/C and one with. The first room seemed to be more fun, there were many people laughing and having fun. The second one was quite boring, it was cold and dark and nobody there. So we wanted to go to the romm without A/C but we couldnt sit down there. We were immediately led to the second room. But after a while it was also quite funny. We made much pictures and discussed nonsense. Some people could speak better Hindi than English so I tried
Photo 74
some Hindi again. From the one beer it became a few and some brandies or whiskys... The bar was closing at 9pm so we still could do our night trip. Sepp had no light but thats normal in India, I have never seen a bike (except mine) with light. The back light even some mopeds or trucks dont have. That night we slept for a few hours under palm trees without our tents.

Our last aim was Calicut at the West coast, the Arabian Sea. We have heard of a resort where you can make boat trips on the backwaters. As we arrived there Sepp could see my face expressing panic because it was very luxurious and seemed to be very expensive. We nevertheless entered. We should sit down on very luxurious seats at the reception. We had some compunctions to sit there because we were so dirty and did not seem to fit to this place. As the reception told us the prices for the boat trips our assumptions were confirmed. It was too expensive for us. But we arranged a date for a Ayurvedic massage for the next day which was really great! After the massage we
Photo 75
decided to go to a cinema. But that was not so easy. We were send from one cinema to the next and they all were closed at that time. Finally we found a cinema with the movie ""Spanish Masala"" in Malayalam. It was quite nice although we havent understood much of the dialogues, of course. We were surprised about the huge, comfortable and very modern cinema. Maybe the best cinema we have seen yet. But the sound was too loud for us. In the middle of that night it was knocking at our door of our hotel room. We first thought that we watched TV too loud, but that was just a staff who started to paint me when we read some newspaper at the reception of the hotel and wanted to finish it.

The last day in Calicut we made a short cycle trip to the nice Kappad beach, where I already have been alone. (Where I first was warned from locals of snakes and was shown another, safe place, and later the police awaked me in the middle of the night to say me that that place is not safe because of thieves)We were lying there in
Photo 76
the sun, so that our stomaches also got a sunburn😊 The water was so warm, that it was not very refreshing to swim there.

We took the train back to Chennai. We had to put our cycles to the parcel office. They couldnt promise that the bikes come with our train to Chennai. We didnt feel very comfortable with this statement! The train was driving the whole night from 8pm to 8am. We had a nice sleeper wagon. We havent thought of a blanket or so and was getting cold in the night. So I could not sleep very well there. Sepp said he could sleep very good. We thought we were already champions with parcel in trains because we aölso had to put our bikes to parcel with the train to Ooty. But we had to learn that Chennai is a bit bigger than Ooty. We had to go from office to office and nobody could tell us were our bikes are. After a while we were told that we have to come back later and see if they are there then. They only arrived at 3pm but they arrived! It took some time to get a hotel,
Photo 77
all hotels are full. This phenomen we also had in the other towns. In germany the hotels would be very lucky if they had so much guests all the time! The room we got was very bad and expensive. One woman was brushing the dust from one corner to the next and wanted to have some tip for that. Even after that, everytime she saw us she was begging. And that in her hotel. I havent seen that before.

While I was taking some money from an ATM, Sepp found a person who was interested to buy his bike. He paid 9000R and the guy wants to pay him 4000R if he gives him the bill. In the evening there was also another interested guy that had paid him 2500R immediately. But he refused. He couldnt find the bill again and the next evening he only got 2000R from the first guy. Better than nothing! He was happy to get rid of it. The last day Sepp was a bit ill. He had to vomit into a dustbin. Nobody noted that. Seems to be quite normal there. We were in a little park with zoo in Chennai and went
Photo 78
early to bed. And again I could leave him much stuff to reduce my luggage. Sepps flight back to Germany was in the morning of the 18.2.

It was a really great time! Thank you so much for your visit!

Tur til pondicherri som ligger ca. 150 km syd for Chennai.

Min første weekend i Indien afsted med et par kollegaer.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry

Lørdag:

Afslapning ved rooftoppool og generel dovenskab, om aftenen på byens hotteste natklub som lukker kl 22.30.
Denne del af Indien er MEGET konservativt...

Søndag:

Sove længe og se lidt af byen.

Blev velsignet af en elefant😊

En mand stjal vores sko i håb om at få penge for at have passet på dem, han endte dog ikke med at få en Rupie.

Til sidst en tur til Auroville som er et lille samfund, som de fleste nok ville kalde en sekt, startet af både vesterlændinge og indere.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroville



Alt i alt en god weekend at starte Indien-eventyret på😊

Kanyakumari

We started on 31st March 2012 toward Kanyakumari from Bangalore at around 4 PM in the evening. It took around 1 hour to dodge the traffic and get out of the city. But we all were excited for this long trip. I forgot to tell you guys that the entire trip was a road trip so lots of driving involved 😊 (Best way to travel in India). Our first stop was near Krishnagiri On a Fuel station. We had our dinner in McDonald’s. Just make sure fill your self here because you wont get anything good after that. We stopped to refuel in couple of places. Complete road is a 4 Way higway NH7 so you can speed upto 120-160KMPH but be careful of coming wrong side traffic. We reached Kanyakumari before the sunrise, but got very disappointed by the crowd and the clouds. It is not worth staying in kanyakumari. So we head toward Kovalam, Kerala after freshen up in a restaurant.

Billede af flyveren der fløj mig fra København til Dubai
Denne handler kort om min udrejse til Chennai, lejligheden jeg bor i og mine første indtryk fra det mærkelige land Indien...

Udrejse:

Afsted kl 14.00 fra Kbh, via Dubai (kort mellemlanding 3 timer) til Chennai Indien.

Fik ingen søvn under turen, så var godt smadret da jeg landede kl 8.10 lokal tid (3.40 Dansk tid).

Noget af et kulturchok, gammel smadret lufthavn mennesker overalt og lugt, varme og larm. Blev heldigvis hentet af en kollega og vores chauffør Manu.

Køreturen fra lufthavnen til kontoret hvor jeg lige var inde og sige hej, var også noget af en oplevelse, de kører som død og helvede og man bruger hele tiden horn og lygter. Har faktisk skræmmende nok stort set vænnet mig til det nu..



Lejligheden:

Lejligheden er lækker, traditionen tro er der vagter over det hele, selv om de vist nok sover det meste af tiden. Selvom det er et utroligt lækkert kompleks jeg bor i, er en af vores naboer et lille slumkvarter, sådan er det vist bare i Indien😊

Deler lejligheden med en kollega (fra en anden afdeling), han er oprindeligt franskmand men snakker dansk, og jeg tror nok vi
P3200165
Fra dubai Lufthavn
skal komme til at få det hyggeligt.



Diverse indtryk:

Mænd der går hånd i hånd eller nusser hinanden er i Indien gode venner og ikke homoseksuelle, det er noget grænseoverskridende, men åbenbart ganske normalt.

Mange indere bruger ikke toilet-papir, men ""spuler sig"", så hvis der vådt på gulvet når du kommer ind på et toilet er det let at gætte hvorfor.

Arbejdslønnen for lavtlønsjob er noget der minder om 40 kr om dagen (28 dage om ugen, 10-12 timer om dagen).
Da det er så billigt er der folk til ALT, f.eks. har vi på kontoret (hvor der er tre printere) en gut der tager printene ud af printeren og giver dem til en, meget stenet😊
En autorickshaw (tre hjulet knallert taxi), koster ca. 1-2 kroner at køre i per kilometer (alt inklusiv).

Min dag på et offentligt kontor for at få en ""residential permit"".

Forestil jer et kontor med to skranker i to seperate (meget varme) rum, en 50-100 ansøgere og nogle ansatte der har fået skrankepave nykker.
Man starter med at sidde i kø, så bliver man efter en times tid sendt til skranke 1, de kigger lidt på bunken
P3200166
Fra Dubai Lufthavn
af papirer man har med, bladrer lidt tilfældigt i dem og skriver lidt noter. Så bliver man sendt ind i det andet rum til skranke 2, uden egentlig at vide hvad man skal foretage sig der. Efter man ved at spørge sig lidt for hvad man egentlig skal her og lidt køsidning ender man ved en skranke hvor personen gør det samme som personen i det første kontor. Så bliver man sendt tilbage til det første kontor hvor historien gentager sig. Efter en 3-4 gange frem og tilbage mellem de forskellige kontorer og skranker, og vel at mærke samme personer, (2-3 timer senere) får man en kvittering hvor der står at man kan hente det en anden dag.
Her var jeg så fræk nok til at spørge om jeg ikke kunne få den samme dag, da jeg skulle bruge den til at hente nogle ting jeg har fået sendt med luftfragt. Efter en lang diskussiuon aftaler vi (meget mod skrankepavens vilje) at jeg kan komme tilbage 2 timer senere, kl 16.00, for at hente den. Da jeg kommer tilbage kan jeg godt se at det kommer til at tage tid da jeg har pisset på hendes sukkermad. Jeg ender med
P3200161
Fra Dubai Lufthavn
at få den ca. 18.30, hvor jeg er den ENESTE person tilbage i venteværelset og de lige har provokeret mig lidt med at sidde og hyggesnakke og tage billeder af hinanden. Men jeg behøver i det mindste ikke at komme tilbage og skulle igennem det cirkus en gang til, så jeg kalder det en succes😊

Published: March 25th 2012


Ooty
Elles cueillent le the a la main ou avec une serpe comme celle du druide Panoramix.
24 mars 2012, Ooty

En arrivant à Ooty, comme la ville n’a de charmant que son nom, nous nous sommes mis à la recherche d’un hôtel un peu excentré pour profiter du calme et de la fraîcheur des montagnes. Nous cherchions en compagnie d’un Allemand que nous avions rencontré dans le bus. Nous avions trouvé un hôtel génial, soit un YWCA installé dans un vieux bâtiment religieux en pierre et en bois, avec des salons meublés style 1940, un parc, un jardin et une chapelle. On avait même une bible dans notre chambre! Le charme fût brisé quand on nous a annoncé qu’une seule chambre à un prix vraiment raisonnable était libre, ainsi qu’une deuxième de luxe qui ne valait pas son prix exorbitant. On a pensé la prendre une nuit et changer le lendemain matin pour une plus raisonnable, mais le maître d’hôtel nous a dit qu’elles étaient toutes prises pour minimum deux nuits. Comme l’Allemand voyageait seul, on ne lui a laissé la chambre raisonnable et on a continué notre recherche à pieds, avec nos gros sacs sur le dos, affamés, fatigués et bougons. L’heure suivante n’a été que déception. On est donc revenus au super hôtel en
Ooty
Ecoliers
demandant un lit dans le dortoir, qui coûtait des peanuts. Miraculeusement, une chambre à prix raisonnable était à ce moment libre, et pour autant de nuits qu’on voulait! La morale de l’histoire : demander toujours le plus cheap pour vous faire offrir le raisonnable!

Donc, comme la ville de Ooty n’est pas vraiment charmante et que les parcs nationaux sont actuellement fermés au trekking, on s’est informé pour un tour campagnard. Pour la modique somme de 10$, une ballade de 3 km dans les plantations de thé et la visite d’un village en compagnie de 15 autres touristes nous était offerte. Ce n’est pas si cher, mais l’option gros-groupe-à-la-queue-leuleu ne nous tentait guère. Donc pour 0,25$, on s’est improvisé notre propre tour d’une dizaine de kilomètres traversant 6 villages, des boisés et des plantations de thé!

Accompagnés du même Allemand et de 3 autres Israéliens tous très sympathiques, on a pris un autobus qui nous a laissé à la croisé de la route principale et d’un petit chemin de campagne. On avait avec nous une carte où étaient identifiés les villages et non les routes. Mais ce n’était pas un problème puisque que les nombreux villageois que nous
Ooty
L'heure du the chez un paysans. Devinez ou sont les femmes ?!
croisions nous indiquaient le bon chemin à suivre, et même des raccourcis à travers les plantations de thé! Tout le monde que nous croisions nous saluaient, nous souriaient, voulaient nous aider, nous parler. L’un deux nous a même invité à prendre le thé chez lui! Tout compte fait, je dirais que nos rencontres avec les villageois étaient encore plus belles que les paysages! Il en est toujours ainsi quand on sort des sentiers battus et du carcan touristique. Ce n’est finalement pas si compliqué et tellement plus enrichissant comme expérience!

Pour le retour, on a rejoint la route principale pour embarquer dans le premier autobus qui passait en direction de Ooty. Arrivés en ville, on est allé tout le groupe ensemble boire une bière avant le souper, chose qui ne fût pas facile! En fait, à Ooty, ils n’en vendent pas dans les restaurants, il faut aller dans un bar… si on peut appeler un bar! My god, c’est l’endroit le plus miteux où je suis allée de toute ma vie! Il faut d’abord acheter ce qu’on veut boire au rez-de-chaussée à un gars qui se trouve derrière une grille. On a demandé two cold beers, il nous a
Ooty
Merci mme pour votre the, votre mari nous l'a bien servi. Et surtout merci pour votre beau sourire!
donné deux bières tablettes en nous disant que c’est natural cold… Il n’est peut-être pas sexy le barman, mais pas mal futé! Et pour ceux qui veulent un drink, tu dois acheter le kit au complet et faire toi-même ton mix, que tu emportes avec toi si jamais tu quittes sans l’avoir fini. Ensuite, on monte au deuxième où il n’y a que des tables en bois avec des petits tabourets en plastiques, que des hommes, et que des indiens. Pas de musique, pas de billard ni de babyfoot, pas de pop-corn. Juste de la boucane!

En compagnie de Stephen et de Lis (nous croyons que ce couple Allemand-Israélien a débuté à Ooty), on a quitté Ooty pour Munnar, Ô combien plus joli !!! La route a été très longue mais en valait définitivement la peine. En 11 heures, on a pris 4 autobus locaux pour faire le trajet tortueux. Le dernier tronçon était tout simplement magnifique, tout comme notre ballade d’aujourd’hui. Je n’ai jamais rien de vu de tel!

Je garde le meilleur pour la prochaine chronique... Bye!

Ilana – c’est mon nom en Hebreu, qui signifie arbre. Hey ben!

Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary
'Yes, you can go to Vedanthangal alone'

This was the first statement from my wife as I woke up.But I knew there were some hidden constraints underneath.

'What's the condition?',i asked

She smiled and said,'No camera (except ur cell phone),your budget would be 100/- and still need to write a blog with photos,once you come back'

I said yes,but I was thinking how to make it possible.

I started from my place in Chennai around 10am.Before that I took 3 cigs: from my packet and she deducted 15/- for that,so I was left with just 85/-.

I knew the route,so it wasn't difficult for me to point the place but the 'big' question was how to make it with just 85/-.

I took a bus/train and reached Chengelput bus stand.This was a funny place. And even though I could speak Tamil,people were finding it too hard to understand me. After a lot of questions exchanged,One guy just pointed a 'V' and left.I was sitting at the Chengelput bus stand and decoding what the big mystery behind this 'V' was. Suddenly,I saw a bus '121V', brain clicked, and I asked the conductor whether this was
Avianic 'India'
going to Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary. The guy said in pure Tamil out which i could figure out only 'Padalam'. I heard about this place before so hoped in. The bus dropped me at Padalam Junction. It was like a small 'Freeway spot' with a few shacks around. There were absolutely nothing else. I knew I had to go another 15km from this place to reach Vedanthangal. With no options left,I started walking. Suddenly, i saw one auto fellow with a few passengers just whisked me from behind.I asked him whether he knew about Vedanthangal BS. He nodded,i again hoped in. This vehicle was overflowing with local crowds. And with someone's generousity I managed a corner somewhere inside.I didn't know I was actually on someone's lap that too an old lady. God !! Finally,he dropped me at Vedanthangal Sanctuary around 2pm and surprisingly I was the only person showed up.

I got the tickets and went inside. 'God !! where is this place',was my first interaction. All I could see 'birds'. The world starts and ends here with 'birds'. I didn't know from where they are which class they belong to,but all colorful 'Avians' greeted me wiith their wings flapping
Painted Stork
in this scorching afternoon. With my knowledge,I could spot Painted Storks,Open Billed Storks, Blue Heron and so many. And once I climbed up the watch tower it was 'all white' as far I could see. Most of the birds were busy picking twigs for their nests or nurturing their egss. I spotted some storks with a very unqiue posture. I wasn't sure whether they were showing their 'rear window' to me. After spending 4 hours, I followed the same route way back home. Yes, you would be asking me, whether I could make it within 85/-.

Here's the list :

Bus to Guindy Rly Stn - 5/-
Train to Chengelput - 10/-
Bus to Padalam Junction - 7/-

Little Egrett
'Sir,birds are fine but beware of snakes and they are poisonous too'

This was the first statement from my boat man Madhi and we were hovering around the dense channels of Pichavarm Mangrove Forest.

Couple of years ago, during a java discussion, I was comparing West Bengal with
Tamilnadu. Starting from The Himalayas, Darjeeling when our discussion reached Sunderban,

my peer Sriram said,

'Dude,Sunderban may be the best but we have Pichavaram'

I asked with raising eyebrows, 'Where the hell is that?'

'Just 20kms from Chidambaram Town and don't you know it is the 2nd largest Mangrove forest after Sunderban'

I said,'Man, you must be joking or getting high and dry after two cappuccinos'

Sriram said,'Na,You can refer to any book or site, my information is correct, i've been there'.

It was way back in Spetember,2009 and since then somewhere deep down the core, Pichavaram was
creating a shell. Finally, in March,2012,the shell transformed to a tour.

I started from Pondicherry early in the morning at 6am.The small Pondicherry guest was good but they had too many airborne inhuman squadrons in my room.Yes,I am talking about the mosquitoes. So with long
Inside Pichavaram Forest
stretched and frequent 'yawns',I asked the conductor at the Pondicherry Bus stand,'Chidambaram?'. With a smile he nodded. This is what I like best about Tamilnadu, wherever you travel, you have buses in quick intervals. The bus was almost vacant. Like every 'first boy' does in school and what I never did in my entire educational life,I took the first seat,next to the driver.There were hardly 10 people in the bus.The young lad was at his best.We crossed Cuddalore (24kms from Pondicherry) in no less than an hour.The Pondicherry-Karaikal Port road is amazing and too good for a ride. After a few hop ons and ins,we reached Chidambaram bus stand.It was exactly 9am.Distance between to Pondicherry to Chidambaram is around 78 kms.I was 'starving' for a smoke.I had one then gradually walked inside the terminus. Chidambaram is a divisional town like our Burdawan or Siliguri.I asked one fellow about the buses to Pichavaram.He guided me to the end of the terminus and said that I should look for Bus no '3B'.After 20 minutes I saw a '3B' came inside the stand and before I could grab a seat all the college students had their bags 'marked' in them.I managed a corner
Pichavaram
and was thinking about my next plans. Suddenly, one lad asked me,

'Anna,where are you from?'

'Chennai',I said

'Do you work for CSC?', the guy asked

'yes', I replied

'So my elder brother does and I will work there one day' and offered his seat.

I was surprised with this 'suburb hospitality' that atleast someone heard about my company name here with such respect even my CEO doesn't have for sure. Later,I found that he could figure it out from the backpack I was carrying. It has a CSC logo printed.With those giggling young college students which I was really enjoying their company,I reached Pichavaram at 10:30 am. The bus drove back through the same Pondicherry Road for about 6 kms and then took a right turn towards Killai village and drove further down to Pichavaram.

I never understand that why I always show up being the 'only and lonely' person to
every spot. It was small boathouse with a watchtower on the left and ticket counter on the right.I also found one TTDC guest house and restaurant attached. However, I walked to the ticket counter and surprisingly saw the same person whom
Core Area
I asked about the bus to Pichavaram in Chidambaram bus stand.

'So you took the right bus',he smiled

'My presence answers your question’, I replied with a big 'Bengali' smile.

He was describing the fares for the boat rides,rules and regulations.I paid for 2 seater row boat for two hours.One young lad,hardly in mid twenties named 'Madhi' greeted me with a traditional Tamilian smile.When I was asked about my native and after listening the name 'Bengal',he went on for about a 10 minutes brain jammer with 'what Sunderban has and this place doesn't have'.This is what I like about The Tamilians that they never show what they have. Things apart,I was surprised with his knowledge about the 'Flora and Fauna' of Sunderban and this place. I thanked that 'Ticket Counter guy',I knew he had his best man with me and it was gift of travelling in the same bus from Chidambaram.

'Sir, this two km stretch we need to cover in two hours.I will take you to the 'Dasavatharam'(Famous movie of Kamalhasan'😉 shooting spot and return.Madhi said with a wicked smile.

I knew the drill,I took two hundreds out of my pocket and said,
'I
Dove
have seen Dasavatharam,and I am not interested. Take me deep inside you can'

He grabbed one of them and said,

'Sir,I am taking you to a very scenic and dense canal,but it is risky if the boat gets stuck in mud,we both have to push it.I will make it to a 5 kms ride,but do you have water to drink? as I may need because I will be rowing the boat much faster.If you like then pass on the second note else I don't need'.

I had two bottles of water with me and took them out,kept infront of him,'go ahead'.

He switched route immediately and took me deep inside the forest. Initially it was all enjoyable but after 20 minutes when the forest started getting dense, I was getting my heartbeat rising.It was all green and covered with dense thick mangrove roots. I watched atleast ten different types of birds what I had hardly seen before. At some places the mangrove trees covered and created a thick shed above that you barely could see the sunlight. I was trying to get hold of a root like Tarzan and then Madhi warned me about the snakes
Pichavaram Forest
which eventually turned me into a 'good boy'.Madhi was rowing the boat with all his blood pumped. Atleast thrice the boat got stuck in the mud but he went to knee down shallows and tugged it out. He also caught a couple of huge crabs. I have never seen such huge crabs in my life. One crab weighed 500-700 gms atleast.He took the boat far deeper and then my voice started acting erratic. Yes, I had my veins out,I was scared to go further.Madhi kept on telling me that there were no animals so stay relaxed,but I was scared what if the boat gets stuck completely and some snake curls down from the roots.I went on taking snaps for hours and finally he took me out to the main stretch. It was amazing.I knew that I had to come back again for one reason, My sweetheart. She would have been the happiest person in this galaxy. After spending an hour or so in a few more canals which were not that deep and dense, Madhi rowed me back to the same from where we had started. This guy knew his job,I was more than happy so offered him another two
Life at Pichavaram
hundreds but he took one and requested to post his photos I took. I loved this guy.

After which,I took the bus from Pichavaram to Chidambaram and immediately from Chidambaram to Chennai which took about six and half hours to reach home.

A sanpshot of Pichavaram :

How to go : Rail/Bus : Nearest station is Chidambaram and from there need to take buses/taxis to Pichavaram which is just 15 kms. Bus fare is just 7/- and Taxi from Chidambaram to Pichavaram and back would cost around 700/-

Where to Stay ; Pichavaram has a TTDc bungalow with not much no: of rooms else Chidambaram has plenty of accommodation options that fits within your pocket size.

What to see : Mangrove Forest and plenty of birds.

The boat ride starts from 9 am to 6pm.

Charges : 2 seater rowboat - 220/- for 2 kms/2 hours
4 seater motor boat - 400/- 5kms/2 hours (but motor boats will not go dense inside the forest)
8 seater motorboat - 800/-/2 hours

Please carry your own food as options are limited. Unless you are a freak like me,better to hire a taxi from Chidambaram
Amazing Pichavaram
otherwise buses ply in every one hour from Chidambaram to Pichvaram.

People speak broken English so language could be a problem. Try to reach there as early as possible as riding a boat at 12 noon may not be comfortable. Keep sufficient drinking water with you while riding.Try avoiding weekends as local folks might like to make a trip to this place and you may see a lot of people waiting for boats as they have a limited number of row men.

Once again,thanks for reading this,hope you liked.

Best,
Sumit

India must have more adverts per square mile than any other country in the world, certainly more than any country I have visited anyway. Indian towns are filled to the brim (and often well over the brim) with a sensory overloading array of billboards, posters and signs, you will often even find advertising painted on the side of peoples homes. Every centimetre of space seems to have been claimed by advertising, nothing but nothing is sacred. One of the things that has most surprised me is the amount of advertising that is dedicated to cement. Cement is perhaps the most heavily marketed product in India, I would even hazard a guess that there are more adverts for cement than there are for mobile phones, Bollywood films and soft drinks combined. There are countless cement brands and you will find adverts for them in every town, village, wall in the middle of nowhere and also continuously on radio and TV. I have even noticed a few programs on Indian television are sponsored by cement manufacturers! This plethora of cement advertising struck me as strange initially but I guess it’s not that strange when you consider that India is a country which is

advancing/growing rapidly and a country where most construction is generally done by the property owners i.e families build their own homes. The only type of advertising that is more numerous than cement advertising is political advertising, which is so abundant in quantity it is both disturbing and laughable. You literally cannot drive more than 20 metres in any town big or small without seeing some form of political advert, often the same one you saw a few metres down the road. The sight of a (usually ugly) politicians giant face looking down at you can feel a bit Big Brother-esque at times, surely advertising in such quantities is not only a wasteful use of resources but also bordering on propaganda. I’m sure Goebbels would approve.

Sorry got a bit side tracked there, back to the case in hand.

Pondicherry was the governing and administrative centre for the handful of tiny colonies France used to control in India, the town is now famous for its Gallic influence which is visible in the towns design, it’s architecture and customs. Despite not belonging to France these days, (control was relinquished in 1954, Rough Guide, 2011) the French still keep a high

As you can tell by my minimal and rubbish photos there was not much to see in Pondicherry!
commission here as well as various government buildings connected to for example trade. It all feels a bit like the French are trying desperately to hold on to some remnants of past glory, but now have nothing more than the tips of their fingers on the prize. Give it a rest France, the days of empire are long gone.

Pondicherry is a relatively pretty, if not a little dull town. The first few blocks by the seafront contain some nice looking French colonial style buildings and the streets in this section are noticeably less chaotic and chocked with traffic than the blocks that follow behind (which are just like any Indian town i.e complete madness). There is little to do in Pondicherry but it is a pleasant enough place to wander for a few hours. We were all however very excited about the opportunity to eat an actual beef steak, beef is a very rare commodity in largely Hindu India but the French influence in Pondicherry means that cow is very much on the menu here. No I can thank the French for something other than Daft Punk! Peter and myself visited supposedly the best restaurant in town, Le

Club, to try the towns ‘legendary’ French cuisine. I had a sirloin steak with a blue cheese sauce, I asked for my steak rare and it came out blue (how very French), fortunately I don’t mind my steak raw. The sauce was a little salty and thick but still worked well with the steak, the fries that came with the steak were fantastic, really fantastic in fact, the side salad was limp and fairly pointless. Overall I enjoyed my meal but was a bit underwhelmed considering the restaurant was supposedly the best in town and the cost of the food here was dramatically higher than the other restaurants in town.

Other than being famous for being a French enclave Pondicherry is also famous for the Auroville Ashram, which is actually based 12km outside of town. The ashram is actually more like a commune where people from all over the world come to live life an ‘alternative’ self sustaining life style (and smoke lots of pot). I didn’t actually get the chance to visit Auroville as you have to book in advance which I didn’t realise beforehand, it’s a real shame I couldn’t go as I’m sure it would have

been a fascinating experience. There are however signs of Auroville all over Pondicherry, for example most of the people wondering the streets look like they are Auroville hardcore meditators (and Auroville hardcore pot smokers) and many of the hotels/hostels/shops in the city are owned by Auroville and staffed by Auroville devotees. I would love to visit an Ashram one day to see how I found it, I suspect I wouldn’t get on with it very well and would probably get really bored but still I would like to give it a go one day.

We left Pondicherry the following day and headed to our next destination Mamallapuram. Supposedly most people visit Mamallapuram to see its famous temples, especially the shore temple which is built close to the sea and as such has been weathered and smoothed in a unique way by the salty sea air. For us cultural neanderthals however the main attraction was the beach, restaurants with WIFI and for the girls (stereotypical but true) the touristy clothes, jewellery and curios shops. The temple was ok, but it was so hot when we visited that none of us wanted to spend much time there. The beach, which I would describe as fairly average, was littered with signs of the local fishing industry (boats, nets etc) and was backed by scruffy palms, grass and restaurants. While it was not the prettiest beach, it was still a beach and we were pleased to be by the coast again, especially as we had anticipated the beach in Mamallapuram would be an open human toilet rather than something usable. I started my day by indulging in a rather large Thali lunch which was pretty good but not outstanding, I then spent the rest of my time exploring the town, frolicking in the sea and even doing a little bit of shopping, well trying to do shopping, but in reality failing miserably. Apparently the traders of Mamallapuram only sell really awful Peter Panesque trousers in colours that would make even a blind man cry.

The real big event for the group in Mamallapuram however was the farewell party we would hold in the evening for those that would sadly by leaving the tour tomorrow. Unfortunately it was not to be a night of good food or quick service for that matter either. Things started off badly when the waiter tried to sell us fresh fish at quadruple the rate we had paid in Varkala and at a price which would have even seemed a dear at home. In the end we didn’t buy any fresh fish as the waiter would not reduce the prices below a ludicrously inflated rate, it was a foolish strategy on the restaurants behalf as we are a group of 20 and would have purchased a lot of fish if the price was right. Following this incident I was a little annoyed and apprehensive about what was to come but not to the point of serious concern, at this point they still in mind had plenty of time to come good, the food will probably be great I told myself. I decided I would order the seafood platter which at 450rps (5.50 gbp) was comparatively expensive but with a line up of grilled fish, prawns and calamari served alongside vegetable fried rice I thought it would be worth the higher than usual outlay, especially as tonight was a special occasion. After placing my order I went downstairs to give the parents a call using my newly acquired telephone credit. It was really great talking to Mum and Dad, for various reasons it had been difficult to phone home prior to this point so it was really nice to finally be able to have a long chat and hear the news from home. After a 45 min chat to the parents I returned to the restaurant to find that no food and only a few drinks had been served, half of us were still missing our beers, how hard can it be to open a few beers? What on earth had they been doing for 45 mins? This was starting to become ridiculous and I was starting to get seriously hangry (hangry = when you get angry because you are so hungry, thanks for this one Jenny). Apparently the restaurant had run out of cold beer despite Jenny (tour leader) warning them earlier in the day that 20 of us would be coming in and wanting plenty of drinks. I did eventually get a semi cold beer (I’m still not sure where it came from) and my seafood platter after well over an hour’s wait and after some people had already eaten their whole meal. When my plate arrived I felt close to tears, what was this plate of misery and despair doing in front of my eager eyes, surely this could not be mine? Very quickly my despair turned to anger, I had hit boiling point and began to physically shake with rage. Never before has the gap between expectation and reality been starker, I had been sold a deluxe BBQ fishy dream and had been served a diabolical monstrosity a sewer rat would steer clear of. On my plate were 3 badly burnt prawns that tasted of carbon and two pathetic and sad looking tiny fish which looked and smelt like they were probably already past their best in the Jurassic period. I did foolishly try a nibble of the fish and as expected it was truly rancid. My calamari and vegetable rice had obviously been so embarrassed by the state of the prawns and fish that they decided not to show up at all, can’t say I blame them. I’m not a massive fan of complaining in restaurants and typically take the British view that it’s best to smile and pretend everything was great, don’t want to cause a scene now do you. However occasionally something annoys me so much that I have no choice but to make a formal complaint, tonight was justifiably one such occasion. I called the waiter over and pointed out the missing items (calamari and vegetable rice), the hideously black carbonised prawns and above all the dangerously gone off fish. In my most forceful and serious voice I told the waiter that I wouldn’t be paying for my meal and wouldn’t be having any of his funny business telling me otherwise. I did offer however to pay 100 RPS for the prawns as I had eaten them by this point, they were disgusting but I was bloody hungry. The waiter of course didn’t agree at first but I wasn’t going to be overruled, this food was not only terrible but also potentially dangerous. I can feel the rage building up inside me just remembering the experience! In the end they agreed to only charge 100 rps, which was still too much really. I didn’t order anything else as I wasn’t convinced the kitchen could prepare it in less than 5 months and even then who knows what I would actually get, maybe a putrefied rat curry? Sonia did however very kindly share her Chicken Tikka curry and rice with me so I did at least have something to line my stomach. Sounds like the night from hell right? Especially when you consider it wasn’t just me who had a bad food experience. However, for some reason halfway through the night the beer, wine and thus good times started flowing. One of the waiters bought round 2 bottles of just about drinkable local rum which he shared with us, encouraging us all to do shots that were so large they made you gag a little. We had forgotten about the dreadful food and prior terrible service and were now very much having a great time. I have come across a few instances in India where an establishment is very much better at being a bar than a restaurant, this was certainly one such case, as was Rock and Roll in Varkala. So after a very unpromising start things dramatically improved and we all ended up having a really cracking night. It was in the end a fantastic farewell party for a fantastic group of people who really did deserve a good send off.

It was a late night in the end, some of us headed off to bed at the rather unsociable hour of 03.00am, tomorrows early start would be a challenge. Maybe that last kingfisher strong wasn’t such a good idea........

March 1st 2012
Published: March 11th 2012


The drive from Mallaparum to Chennai was not a particularly long one, but we had left early as the truck needed repair work done on it in a garage in Chennai and thus needed to get there as early as possible. This normally would have been fine, but given that we were (most of us anyway) hideously hungover from the previous nights farewell party, an early start was most unwelcome. Already this was starting to be a bad day. Today was always destined to be a sad/bad day however as it was leaving day for many great people whom I had come to know and love. Today we would be saying a sad farewell to the legends that are Sally, Sarah, Bill, Carol, Colin, Marge and Luciana, as well as my very good friends Peter (room buddy for 6 weeks) and Sonia. Upon arrival however my mood was picked considerably by news that Chennai had an American Dinner which served bacon and sausage for breakfast, get me a tuk tuk immediately, I’m there! It took around 10 mins to get us from the hotel to the dinner, although this felt much longer with the heavy weight of anticipation hanging over us. After 10 torturous minutes we arrived, upon arrival I jumped out of the tuk tuk and excitedly ran to the entrance of the dinner, hooray it was bacon and sausage time! With great anticipation I went to open the entrance to the dinner only to then be confronted with the grey shutters of despair, OH NO! The dinner was closed and the lack of human activity inside and out made it look like it wasn’t opening any time soon. Dejected and secretly very close to tears I/we decided we would come back later for dinner and head to KFC instead for breakfast (because you can’t beat 3 pieces of greasy fried chicken at 10.30am, unless it’s 3 pieces of greasy bacon and sausage of course).

I literally did nothing in Chennai, I did not go to explore the sights, I did not go to any museums, I did not go shopping, hell I didn’t even go for lunch. There is apparently little to see in Chennai (not that I could tell you if there was anyway) and to be honest after several days on the go and the previous nights heavy partying, I was keen to have some time to just sit around, sleep and indulge in some much needed slothfulness.

At 17.00 it was time to say goodbye to my very good buddy Sonia, it was an emotional farewell and we were all (myself in particular) sad to see her leave. Sonia I wish you the best of luck in your exam, you are being missed. Shortly after Sonia’s departure it was time for our pre departure meeting with the new people who were joining in Chennai. I hate it when a leg finishes and a new one starts, firstly and perhaps most obviously because you tend to lose people who have become really good friends, in this instance two of my closest and some mighty fine others. Secondly though I hate it because you have to meet new people and I’m always scarred that the new people will be complete assholes and will hate me. I’m not really sure where this fear comes from as on each occasion the new group members have been really great and within 48 hours (or less with beer) we are getting on like old friends. However it is a problem that plagues me and I do find it a real shame that I tend to view the thought of meeting people I don’t know with negativity and dread, which in itself is strange as I tend to get along with most people at least reasonably well. Anyway I’ll save the psycho analysis for a professional when I have a break down in later life..... Peter made a poignant and valid observation saying that he felt sorry for the new people joining in Chennai as they would have to try and blend into a group of people who had known each other for up to 8 weeks (6 weeks in my case). That certainly put things into perspective and made me realise that my concerns and worries were not only trivial but also rather self indulgent. As it turns out (as it always does) the new people were great, we had an English couple, a solo female traveller from Norway, a scots man (better not say British), a Australian gentleman and two English men join us. Once again I was the only bloke under 40 on the truck, however I wasn’t to bothered by this as I had come to realise in recent weeks that being the only young male on a truck full of interesting and beautiful girls isn’t too bad at all <span>:-)

After the pre departure meeting we met with the remaining people from the last leg and headed off for our final supper. Once again we headed towards Sparky’s American Dinner only this time we were really, really hungry and really, really looking forward to a burger. I won’t beat around the bush. Yes, once again it was ******* closed. Oh great. As it turns out Sparky’s had been closed down for 2 weeks and would be closed for another 2 weeks for renovations. There were accusations made within the group that the tuk tuk drivers knew Sparky’s was closed but took us anyway so that they could make a fare. Whether this is true or not I cannot tell you, I can tell you however that the tuk tuk drivers did make a double fare as upon finding Sparky’s was closed we headed straight back to a restaurant on the same road as our hotel, make of that what you will. We did eventually get some food and very good it was too, unfortunately we were all a little terse after the Sparky’s experience and perhaps also because our restaurant of choice did not sell beer. As such, our farewell meal was not perhaps as jovial as well had all hoped, still it was a great meal and it was nice to spend some time together before the inevitable sad goodbyes. My final goodbye of the day and perhaps the most poignant was to my ex room buddy Peter. We had become close over the past 6 weeks and formed a perhaps surprisingly close friendship, something I’m sure neither of us would have anticipated on day one. For me it had been a real education learning that age does not necessarily have to define your personality and outlook on life. Peter is as sharp, witty, carefree and up for it as anyone I know of my own age and was often much more up for doing/trying things than the ‘younger’ people on the tour. Peter I hope you are enjoying smoking your Cuban cigars at your free will and I hope plans for your summer of sailing are progressing well. I look forward to joining you in the Adriatic for a stint in 2013 if I don’t see you sooner.

Tomorrow we would be heading for Tirupati to visit the temple of Lord Venkateshwara, the busiest and richest temple in India (supposedly).....

Hi!

God, I've had a tough few days. Sometimes India can be a bitch.

It wasn't bad in a near-death way, just night buses with overweight man next to me, overpriced hotels with people that woke me up at 5.30 to get me to check out, feeling sick, nothing working, no water or electricity and a general bad mood - bad. So, just India-bad.

But! Now it's all better. I'm in a gorgeous little town, a world-heritage sight full of temples and rock carvings. I have a tiny little room, that I'm paying close to nothing for, a hope that I will make it out of Delhi somehow, and if I don't I just pay some ridiculous sum of money for a nice hotel room and go clubbing. Yay!





So, here's the deal. I don't really want to see the Taj Mahal. I know, it's a must-doo-must-see-must-not-die-without-it, but I just can't be bothered. It's a detour, it's full (!!!) of tourists, it's just a building.

There, I've said it. It might be a bad idea, as I just might end up doing it anyway if I can't get the train I want, but .. There's so many other things I would much rather spend my money and time on. Like the golden temple in Amritsar, a camel safari, a nice curry, the bazaars in Delhi and Mumbai, maybe even something ridiculous like a huge stone Shiva figure that I've been eying all day.



I must say, even with all it's annoying aspects, I love this country. Where ells does the rickshaw driver ask you to come to his house and meet his family, the women bathing in their saris, the spice plantation workers ask you to join you for their coffee break on the ground, the local struggling man use his only day off to show you around his town, the families gather around to get a photo taken with the foreigner, the cyclists carry huge piles of empty pots and pans on their backs, the street food taste as good as any restaurant food and elderly ladies hug you from behind in the line to the temple?

Cute.

Krishna's Butter Ball
Its been a while since I last wrote but I've ben very very busy doing nothing at all.

After leaving Kovalam I popped up to Trivandrum which is only a few miles up the road to catch a flight to Chennai (Madras). Spent the night there but didn't really do alot except eat, drink and sleep. Durring the day there was a huge march/demo on the main road outside the hotel. Not sure what it was all about but quite a few people were carring big pictures of uncle Joe Stallin, Karl Marx and Lenin so i'm going to take a stab in the dark and say it was something to do with the communist state government.

Had an uneventfull flight from there up to Chennai but only passed through on my way an hour down the coast to Mamallapuram. I had planed on a few days there before moving on but I really liked it and am running out of steam a bit so stopped for ten days in the end. Its only a small place large village rather than a town and is famous for the five rathas (temples carved out of solid rock), rock carvings, Krishna's
Sunbathing Cow
butter ball and local rock carvers.

I'd seen most of the sites in the first few days so spent about a week just wandering around watching the carvers at work and lounging in the garden of the place I was staying reading and watching the resident troop of monkeys up to no good. Had to be carfull not to leave anything unattended or the next thing you know theres a monkey up a tree wearing your Y fronts on his head.

The only downside to the place was the constent power cuts. Its a big problem in tamil nadu so the torch i bought with me was worth its weight in gold.

After leaving mamallapuram it was a quick trip through Chennai again for the flight to Mumbai for the last few days before flying home. I had my name called over the tanoy at the airport as secruity weren't happy about something. Luckily they just wanted to search my hold luggage, had visions of the old rubber glove and the inability to sit down for a week!!

So I'm now right back where I started 3 months ago in Mumbai. Saw some more filming going
Rock Carving
on this morning right next to the place i'm staying, hung around again in the hope of bollywood stardum but it wasn't to be just ended up having a barney with the secruity bloke about weather or not i could take photos. He said I couldn't I gave him a lesson in some of the more colourfull words in the English language.

So thats it for another year will see some of you in a few days and will continue with the blog in December, have no idea where it will be from so let me know if you have any ideas.

Madurai (17)
Madurai
Weetje : dansen is zeer belangrijk voor Indiërs. Naar verluid even belangrijk als seks! De klassieke Tamil dans telt 108 heilige posities. Standjes, zeg maar (...of was ik toch in het verkeerde boek aan 't lezen?).



Neen hoor, ze staan allemaal afgebeeld op de oostelijke gopuram van het Nataraja Tempel (Chidambaram)



















Maandag 20/02/2012 - Van Trichy naar Madurai











De Chaos in Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) is nog een graad erger dan wat we tot hiertoe al hebben ervaren. Maar ook chaos went. Wat niet went is het onophoudelijk getoeter van wat maar rijdt! In alle toonaarden. Te pas en te onpas.











De Sri Rangatanathaswamy tempel, gewijd aan Vishnu, gaat door als de grootste in India. In feite lijkt het meer op een ingesloten stad dan op een gebedsplaats. Om binnen te geraken moet je maar even door 7 'gopuram's' (rijkelijk/overdadig versierde poorten, waarvan de grootste 73 m hoog is. Eigenlijk begint de tempel zelf bij de 4de
Trichy (2)
omwalling. Spijtig genoeg is het interessantste deel enkel toegankelijk voor Hindoes.



Een verscholen trapje laat je toe een glimp op te vangen van het gouden dak van het 'inner sanctum'.











Je kunt er uren, zelfs dagen in het doolhof van gangen verloren lopen, maar voor leken als wij, valt er weinig te zien. Zij het de gebruikelijke drukte van pelgrims en brahmanen, die, deze keer, 3 verticale strepen (teken van Vishnu) op het voorhoofd dragen. Een beetje teleurstellend na de tempels van de voorbije dagen.











De 437 treden naar de Rock Fort tempel, hebben we gelaten voor wat ze waren. De planken van onze voeten zijn al dermate geteisterd, dat deze beklimming ons net een brug te ver leek.











Op weg naar Madurai stoppen we nog even aan een crematieplaats, of beter gezegd waar de rituele verstrooiing van de assen in de rivier wordt gehouden, 10 dagen na de crematie. Je kan je er ook wassen en zelfs een lekker plonsje doen... (je zult
Trichy (3)
dan wel even je grootouders of geburen of enige onbekende onderweg moeten groeten als ze voorbij drijven...)



















Dinsdag 21/02/2012 – Madurai











Volgens Lonely Planet mag Chennai zich het hart van Tamil Nadu noemen, maar Madurai claimt haar ziel te zijn. En waarschijnlijk terecht ook.











Buiten Chaos (het gaat nog altijd crescendo!) staat Madurai - letterlijk de 'stad van honing' - nog voor een prachtig tempelcomplex : de Sri Meenakshi Temple. 6 hectare groot, 12 'gopurams' en een myriade beelden gewijd aan Meenaskshi Amman, de 3-borstige godin met de 'visogen'. Vergis u niet : 3 borsten is onvolmaakt, maar 'visogen' zijn volgens de Tamil-dichtkunst het summum van perfectie.



En wie is nu Meenakshi? Gewoon een andere naam voor Parvati. Niet eens een avatar of andere gedaante, neen. Gewoon een andere naam. Je zou voor minder de tel kwijtraken. Shiva, haar echtgenoot, heet hier dan ook, voor de gelegenheid, maar Sundareswarar.



Btw : die 3de
Trichy (4)
borst, die heeft Shiva – de Vernietiger – deskundig... vernietigd! Zonder littekens achter te laten of course. Plastische chirurgie 'avant la lettre' als het ware.











Alle gekheid op een stokje, de tempel is meer dan een bezoekje waard!

Weird temple at Southern tip - Looks like it was designed/inspired by Disney World
Today marked two important symbolic events. One, we visited the Southernmost point in India, yey! Two, it was the halfway point for our trip, boo! (well it was yesterday in truth but that ruins the symbolism of today). I should also note that this will be published well after the day in question, so the date of publishing is not the same as the day referred to above.

The Southern tip of India is a fairly unremarkable place, much like Lands End is a fairly unremarkable place, in fact I imagine many countries extremities despite being major tourist attractions are actually fairly unremarkable, if not just plain boring. The Southern tip does have a few things going for it however. Firstly it is the Southern tip of India which is in itself an achievement. Secondly being the Southern tip it is surrounded by water which is handy because it is bloody hot, even though it was technically ‘winter’ when we visited, it was still about 37 degrees. Thirdly Jenny (our TL) designated today a tuna sandwich lunch day, yey! Now that may not sound very exciting to you, but when you rarely get to eat a decent western style sandwich
More cases of animal abuse in India
(with actual mayo!) then the thought and taste of some tinned tuna, a bit of cheap mayo and some warm cucumber seems like a real luxury. It’s actually quite nice that you come to view things like a tuna sandwich (and a hot water shower) as a luxury, it’s nice to appreciate and get excited about things that you would normally be so blasé about.

While at the Southern tip, we dipped our feet into the water, ate (devoured in my case) tuna sandwiches, admired the odd statue of Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar that is built on an island just off the Southern Peninsula and shooed off an army of very persistent hawkers who were selling the crappiest looking fake pearl necklaces I have ever seen.

We left the Southern tip around 14.00 and headed towards Madurai arriving around 17.30ish. For the past few weeks I had almost forgotten we were in India, Kerala is a wealthy state with low levels of poverty and we had been staying in small touristy resorts which were somewhat disconnected from the day to day life of ordinary Indians. However, Madurai (the second largest city in the state of Tamil Nadu) brought home
Walkting towards the water at the Southern tip
with a bang that we were still very much in India. The experience was somewhat reminiscent to the initial culture (and noise) shock I received when arriving in Delhi. Madurai is over populated, noisy, smelly, manic, chaotic and did I mention really bloody noisy? But, in a way it was nice be back in the chaos, we had been sheltered for the past few weeks and it was to feel like we were travelling through real (whatever real means) India again. Upon arrival me and my soon to be ex room buddy (boo!) Peter went for a beer (he really is a bad influence!) at a cheap, working mans drinking establishment. It was a pretty grim place but interesting in it’s grimness nonetheless. We were pretty sure drink would be cheap here given the owners obviously weren’t paying much for the upkeep of the premises, or the upkeep of the refrigerators for that matter judging by the warmness of our beer. Sure enough when the waiter asked us for 150 RPS for two beers (about 2GBP) we felt very happy at the price. However upon receiving 150rps from us the cheeky bugger said “no, no it’s 450 rps”, to which
Cooling off at the Southern tip
we said “no bloody way you cheeky ****”. Ok we didn’t actually say this but we certainly made it clear we would not pay 450 rps (about 5.50 GBP) for two beers. Beer ranges in price but typically you pay between 75-150rps (1-2 GBP) per beer, this greedy **** was trying to charge us 225rps per beer which is more than we paid for beer in Indigo one of Mumbai’s best and most expensive restaurants. We refused to pay more than 150rps per beer (still too much really) and then left a little pissed off but ultimately more concerned about dinner, lunch had been a long time ago and we were hungry.

Tomorrow we would be visiting Madurai one of India’s oldest cities and indeed one of the oldest in South Asia (or so the Rough Guide claims)...........

View of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple approaching from a nearby street
I would like to start today’s entry with a little gloating, never a good way to start I know. I’m sorry to start off in such a rude manner but I’m afraid it really must be done. I would like to let all of you in cold, wet and windy Britain know that to this date it has only rained once since I arrived in India and I don’t believe we have had a single cloudy day. Yes your right, I am a smug ****. The one time it did actually it did so at night so we didn’t even get wet, no surprises for guessing where it rained, my favourite Indian town ever (not), Cochin. Would be wouldn’t it. Anyway it’s pretty damn amazing that in over a month I haven’t seen a drop of rain or even anything but a blue cloudless sky, thank you India. Commiserations to all of you at home.

I was super tired waking up in Madurai, maybe it was the long drive the day before, maybe the 4 bottles of Kingfisher strong or maybe the post Varkala hangover finally kicking in. Whatever it was I was not the only person feeling it, several
The west gate at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple
people appeared to be tired and in a foul mood. Not perfect conditions for what would be a long day with 3 temple viewings. Our long suffering but ever patient tour leader Jenny had a particularly torrid time in the morning by having to deal with an unusually uncooperative group before later getting her foot run over by a motorbike. I was very impressed that Jenny didn’t make a big deal about it at all and just got on with her job/day. It must be tough in these situations to maintain your professionalism, I really admire Jenny and other tour leaders as they really do have to deal with so much.

We were in Madurai to visit the Sri Meenakshi- Sundareshwarar temple, one of the busiest and largest in South India, the Rough Guide describes the temples gopuras (pyramid like structures) as “the greatest man made spectacle of the South”. The temple is dedicated to both Shiva and Meenakshi who were married and lived in Madurai from which they ruled the Pandya kingdom.

The temple was surrounded by a large pedistrianised area, the first (and probably last) I have seen in India, it was heavenly! The temple complex
Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple
is to use a much misused/overused word (often by myself), epic, epic in both size and stature. The four gates to the temple are each topped by large, brightly (some may say gaudily) coloured and intricately carved gopuras) which contain carvings of 1,001 gods related too or incarnations of Shiva/Meenakshi. The gopuras are spectacular, the carving is not only extraordinarily intricate but also impressive in it’s sheer quantity, I imagine the gopuras took a very long time complete (we were probably told how long but I have forgotten, apologies, C- try harder next time). Madurai temple is very much a working temple and was full of local and non local worshippers, apparently around 15,000 people visit the temple every day. It was probably the most spiritual temple I have visited in India, it felt like an Oasis of calm in a town/country of craziness. The temple was full of chanting worshippers (some, including women, with fully shaven heads) and holy men who often appeared in a trance like state. The spirituality and devotion of the worshippers was really quite moving, it felt like a privilege to glimpse people worshipping in a temple which was obviously of great importance to them.
me and a holy man Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple


I really enjoyed the Meenakshi temple but after our visit I was feeling pretty tired, pissy and really not in the mood for the afternoon drive and double temple visit we had scheduled in Trichy, our next stop.

We visited both temples in Trichy, one was built on top of a rock and was unsurprisingly called the rock fort. The temple, which is dedicated to Ganesh was average and nothing worth getting excited about, it did however have pretty decent views over the city, but was it worth the 400 step climb? Probably not in all honesty, but then again I was in a bad mood and it was really bloody hot. The second temple, Sri Ranganathaswamy is apparently the largest Hindu temple complex in India and is spread across 60 hectares. It was impressive in it’s size but the actual temples in the complex were spread quite far apart and not particularly impressive, in fact in parts the temple looked like an unfinished building site (oh dear I was having a day). Ranganathaswamy temple like Meenakshi temple in Madurai is very much a working temple, however it was so crazy and busy that I didn’t get the
Looking down at Trichy from Uchipillaiyar Koil rockfort temple
same sensation of it being a spiritual place, especially with all the motorbikes, rickshaws and cheap tat traders who were making an unholy amount of noise on the outskirts of the complex. It’s a shame that both of the temples in the afternoon were of little interest, although I guess we have been spoilt and a little overloaded with temples on this tour and in all honesty temples aren’t of massive interest to me. On another note we didn’t have a guide for the Trichy temples which probably didn’t help endear me to the temples.

Tomorrow we would be heading to Pondicherry (known as Puducherry these days) where we pleasingly wouldn’t have to look at any more temples.........

Tempeldanseres
Thanjavur
We zijn inmiddels in Madurai beland. We zijn maar 4 dagen in India, en worden overspoeld door indrukken :

- een gids die Stalin heet, en een chauffeur Nelson...

- Engels leren herkennen dat helemaal niet op Engels lijkt...

- tempels in alle vormen en maten...
- je blote voeten verbranden op de oververhitte plavuizen van de tempels...

- de chaostheorie aan de lijve ondervinden...

- ... en de mensenzee!



Zaterdag 18/02/2012 - Van Pondy naar Tanjur






In Puducherry, beter bekend als 'Pondy' zijn er meer katholieke kerken dan tempels of moskeeën. Een van de belangrijkste bezienswaardigheden is de Sri Aurobindo Ashram, mede gesticht door een Franse dame, die bekend werd als 'The Mother'. In India zijn alle meditatieve groeperingen erg in trek. Waar je ook maar in gelooft of wilt in geloven, je vindt heus wel je gading.

Verder is Pondy een heus belastingparadijs : deze autonome enclave in Tamil Nadu is namelijk een afzonderlijke 'staat', die bijzonder taksvriendelijke politiek voert.

Volgens Nelson, heb je daar de grootste verzameling dronkaards in India. Reden : geen taks op alcohol. Dit in tegenstelling met Tamil Nadu,
Nataraja tempel 1
Chidambaram
waar disuasieve heffingen bestaan. Daarentegen wordt in Tamil Nadu wel ganja gebruikt. Illegaal en... zonder taksen!

En de diesel : 42 Roepies tov 44 per liter. 2 Roepies (€0.03) verschil! Nelson geraakt er helemaal van opgewonden. “you see, no taxes!” (voor mij is het verschil <5%! (MISSING)Als dat de Belgische aanslagvoet was, kon ik daar perfect mee leven! Ga dat maar eens uitleggen...).




Op weg naar naar Thanjavur (Tanjore), ook wel Tanjur genoemd, liggen een aantal belangrijke tempels op ons te wachten:

- de Nataraja tempel in Chidambaram

- de tempel van Gangakondacholapuram

- Airatesvara tempel in Dharasuram

- Brihadishwara tempel in Thanjavur zelf.

Hoewel alle 4 gewijd aan Shiva, zijn ze erg verschillend qua stijl, maar vooral qua sfeer.

Nataraja betekent zoveel als 'Lord of the dance', en verwijst naar de danswedstrijd tussen Shiva en zijn echtgenote Parvati. Deze laatste verloor en werd pisnijdig en nam de gedaante aan van Kali, de gevreesde wraakgodin!

We gaan niet teveel uitweiden over alle symbolen en stijlen, we zijn tenslotte zelf maar leken.

De Hindoecultuur neem je met al je zinnen op :

- je blote voeten worden
Nataraja tempel 2
Chidambaram
gekweld door de oververhitte (en niet altijd even propere) tempelplavuizen

- allerlei parfums (en minder fraaie aroma's) prikkelen je neusgaten

- de klanken, het licht...

Dit alles in een schijnbaar complete wanorde





En als je de tempel verlaat keer je terug naar de complete (verkeers)chaos. Nooit gezien. Buiten alle proporties... en toch vloeit het!

Vuilnisophaling
Mamallapuram
Uitgesteld is niet verloren.

Toch heeft het vakantiegevoel op zich laten wachten... en India naar zich laten smachten!

Het was nochtans veelbelovend begonnen : onze vlucht van Brussel naar Frankfurt was precis 'on schedule'.

Op weg van Terminal A naar -B begon de twijfel binnen te sluipen : op de affichageborden, nergens geen melding van een vlucht naar Delhi van 22:10 ???

Na her en der wat tegenstrijdige informatie te hebben verzameld, viel het verdict : de vlucht was gecanceld. We zouden moeten wachten tot de volgende dag.

Inmiddels had de luchtvaartmaatschappij ons een hotel geregeld en overgeboekt op de vlucht van donderdag... Verder aandringen of jammeren had geen zin, er was gewoon geen alternatief!

Wachten... en trachten je niet te ergeren... slapen... wachten... WACHTEN...

... en BALEN!

Donderdag 16/02/2012

Ze hebben er de spanning tot op het laatste in gehouden : zowat de helft van de voorziene vertrekken werden gecanceled!!! 😞 We vernamen later dat er een staking aan de gang was .

Maar rond 18:00 verscheen onze vlucht op de borden, en we konden (bijna) op tijd vertrekken.





Vrijdag 17/02/2012 - Mamallapuram

Mamallapuram


's Ochtends, bij de landing in Delhi, is het reeds 28 graden C .



In Chennai (Madras) over 30 C.



Puffen, maar niet klagen, want we zijn er uiteindelijk geraakt.



We vluchten meteen de drukte van Chennai en trekken door naar Mamallapuram (Mahaballipuram), een klein vissersdorpje met een UNESCO erfgoed site.



Even uitblazen aan zee.








Zaterdag 18/02/2012 - van Mamallapuram naar Pondicherry




Oorspronkelijk gepland om hier 2 nachten te spenderen om een volle dag te kunnen besteden aan het verkennen van de archeologische sites... en wat te bekomen van de jetlag.



Maar we hebben tijd in te halen, dus een tandje bijzetten.



Een spoedcursus Hindoe-mythologie ( je weet wel, van Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva en de respectievelijke echtgenotes en reïncarnaties...), in een behoorlijk verstaanbaar Engels, was een absolute must, maar de verhalen zijn zo ingewikkeld dat we onze versverworven kennis verder zullen moeten bijspijkeren.



Stalin, onze gids (neen, dit is heus géén politiek statement !), leidt ons deskundig rond de belangrijkste bezienswaardigheden :



- de
Image00003
Mamallapuram
gebeeldhouwde rotsen met het verhaal van het lijden van Arjuna (lijden heeft in India wel een heel andere connotatie dan bij ons);



- de vijf Ratha's (strijdwagens)



- het idyllisch strandtempeltje.









Nadien voert Nelson, onze chauffeur (neen, hij heeft niets weg van een admiraal), ons verder zuidelijk naar Puducherry (Pondichérry), een voormalig Frans handelspost. Hier heerst nog een vleugje koloniale nostalgie :



- de Franse kwartieren (de 'blanke stad'😉, met Franse straatnamen als 'Rue Dumas' en 'Rue Surcouf';

- de typische képie van de locale politie;

- de 'Croisette' langs het strand;

Hier worden nog grote festiviteiten gehouden op 14 Juli, al hebben deze nog weinig te maken met de inname van de Bastille...

Ruth and I woke at 3.30am and were checked out and in a cab to the airport by 3.45am the trip at this time of the morning was fast and hassle free. We both leave from the same terminal at Delhi Airport which is a real bonus. On arrival we checked in Ruth's bags for her Singapore flight then lodged mine for Chennai which took significantly longer. I then walked Ruth to passport control we said our semi sad farewell as I know she is keen to go home and then watched her through the glass until she moved beyond and out of sight.

I then headed to domestic departures (where I met my girlfriend LOL) and made my way though having a few moments panic when I forgot to retrieve my small pack after putting it through the scanner. I was almost at the gate when I realised so I sprinted back to where I left it and was accosted by security who began lecturing me, not really necessary as I felt stupid as it was. I then headed for my gate, I was the only one there when they started boarding, but soon the plane began to fill
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
up, the last person on was sitting in front of me, first he tried to jam a huge bloody bag into the luggage rack which crushed everyone else’s belongings and then he immediately laid his seat back. I napped a little on this flight so it was soon over and I had swapped the chilly madness of Delhi for the humid madness of Chennai.

When I disembarked I messaged Padraic to see if he was in Chennai or already in Madurai, fortunately (for me) he had been bumped from a flight and was sitting in the lounge so I joined him there and spent the next four hours drinking beer, eating little sandwiches and muffins and chatting. Finally at 2.30pm we boarded a small forty seat aircraft and banked out over the ocean heading for Tamil Nadu's second largest city.

Madurai is a surprisingly peaceful and a very clean city (compared to those in the North), I saw very few cows and dogs and the ones I did see appear to be in much better condition as well. We were met at the airport by our new driver and visited the fantastic five hundred year old Tirumalai Nayak
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
Palace that had been partially and tactfully restored. The Mariamman Teppakkulam Tank (artificial lake) with a pretty temple in the centre was our next destination it is generally dry and used by the local kids as a cricket pitch but due to a recent festival we found it full of water and finally the massive and gaudy Sri Meenakshi Temple it is by far the most impressive Hindu temple complex I have seen and a World Heritage site. We walked around the temple for sometime taking snaps it was surprisingly clean inside and the complex was very interesting although I was disappointed to see a temple elephant that looked in poor condition.

It was then on to the hotel I had pre-booked, unfortunately there was no room for Padraic so the driver took him somewhere else. We caught up for dinner on the roof later, the food was quite good but the mosquitoes where menacing.

The next morning we were packed up and on the road by 9am, the driver had over slept (as they do) and I wasn't happy so I let his boss know about it and he soon arrived and we began the long drive
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
to Ooty. The traffic here is light, the sky is blue, there is little garbage strewn about and the cows don’t appear to be eating plastic, I am truly amazed. The weather is also dry like Adelaide so I am in my element.

We drove for five or six hours arriving in mountainous Coonoor in the Western Ghats around 3.30pm the last hour in the mountains was extremely picturesque and I saw a different species of Langur monkey which was a bit of a surprise. On arrival at the station we booked tickets on the toy train to Ooty (Udhagamandalam), all the first class tickets were booked out so we had to put up with cattle class, fortunately it was a short trip and not very interesting I must admit I had expected nicer views. Ooty is a hill station set up by the British in the early 1800's as a cool summer haven, and it is easy to see why, it is pleasant here and although it has grown since the days of the British it hasn’t lost all its charm with many a pretty church. Padraic and I wandered down to the main part of town for
Mariamman Teppakkulam Tank
Madurai
dinner I grabbed some drugs for my stomach and some great homemade chocolate which they sell everywhere. We stopped for a pleasant dinner before returning to the hotel.

The next morning we moved on to the National Park at Mudumalai it was a short drive, so we had most of the day to wait till we went into the park in the late afternoon, so we just watched the cricket in the lodge's entertainment area and enjoyed the relaxing natural setting, there are quite a few monkeys here and some pretty birds.

At 3.30pm we headed for the park where we were loaded on a noisy old bus and driven around for about thirty minutes and saw nothing, this of course made me extremely angry so I tried to find another way to get in and see another tiger, unfortunately there is no other way, and they rarely see any major wildlife here. We then watched some villages bathing their elephants in the river before returning to the lodge.

Kort
Hey hey!

Det her bliver en hurtig update, bare saadan for at befrie mig selv for at vaere haabloest bagud.

Lige nu er jeg i Madurai, stadig Sydindien, saadan lidt midt i det hele i staten Tamil Nadu (se kort, hvis jeg kan finde ud af at tiilfoeje det). Madurai er endnu en storby, langt mere kaotisk end Mysore og langt varmere. Men vi bevaeger os snart videre, heldigvis. Indtil da har vi valgt at gaa helt bananas og bruge 200 (!!!) kroner paa et hotelvaerelse med A/C, varmt vand, et toilet med skyl, et rigtigt bad, en bloed seng, en dyne og inkl morgenmad.. Det er helt skoert, og tre gange hvad vi normalt ville bruge paa et hotel, men det er bare saa dejligt!

Mit budget er ikke glad for at jeg rejser rundt med min ven Tom, man bruger mange flere penge naar man er to. Man minder hinanden om hvor rart en skaal med pasta ville vaere, og pludselig befinder man sig paa helt aandssvag dyr vestlig restaurant. Hm.

Naa men anyways! Sidst jeg forlod jer svar jeg paa vej til Ooty, som vi tog fra igaar. Ooty var koldt! Som i fire taepper hver nat, alle butikker fulde af sweatre, man tager sokker paa nar man skal op og tisse om natten - koldt.

Det var skoent at fryse lidt igen, og da det var i bjergene har jeg brugt den sidste uge paa at vandre, bestige bjerge og faa vabler.

Vi fandt en hyggeligt lille hotel med udsigt over the plantaerne, ejet af et aeldre par der mindede mig om en hyggelig onkel og tante eller saadan noget. Vildt soede, villige til at hjaelpe med hvad det skulle vaere. Og de havde denne her kaere lille gamle mand ansat, uden en ploek i munden, han var maaske 1.45 hoej og gik bare rundt og grinede til alle.

Vi kunne ikke lade vaere med at blive der i fem dage, det var bare for rart til at lade vaere.

Men da vi efterhaanden havd set alt hvad der var vard at se, koebt alle de gyselige sweatre vi kunne finde. (Jeg fandt en med en snemand. Jeg aner ikke hvornaar jeg nogensinde vil tage den paa igen, men den var bare saa dejlig at jeg nu slaeber rundt paa den) og shoppet boeger i massevis (igen, hvornaar laerer jeg at jeg ligesom skal baere de her ting og jeg snart ikke kan frasortere mere af mit toej uden at gaa noegen rundt?) syntes vi at det var paa tide at komme videre.

Vi forsoegte os foerst med togstationen. Manden bag disken var ikke glad for at vi saadan skulle komme og stille spoergsmaal midt i hans arbejdstid, saa det fik vi ikke meget ud af. Vi tror vist nok der ikke var plads paa nogle toge.. Maaske. Vi gav i hvert fald op.

Istedet fik vi den brilliante ide at give os i kast med de doedsfaelder man kalder ""government busses"" heromkring. Jasaa.. Ti timer. Paa bjergveje der er placeret som om man taenkte ""Hvordan kan vi goere disse veje mest latterligt smalle og faa presset saa mange blinde vinkler og blinde kurver og blinde turns ind som muligt?""

Heldigvis tog vi dagsbussen i stedet for natbussen, for som vores chauffoer sagde ""I drive bus back to Ooty tonight, no problem!"" og da vi spurgte hvornaar han sov grinede han bare. Naaja, hvem behoever ogsaa soevn? Pf, toesedrenge!

Jeg sad paa forsaedet. Bare saadan at hvis nu vi ramte noget saa ville jeg i det mindste bare ryge ud, det syntes jeg var en beroligende tanke. Og saa kunne jeg straekke benene. Fordel.

Jeg vil ikke give for mange detaljer, lad mig bare sige at jeg var glad for at vi have koebt snacks i massevis og at vi kom ud derfra i live.



Imorgen aften tager vi nattoget til den aller sydligste spids af Indien, hvor tre have moedes: Det arabiske hav, det Indiske ocean og Bay of Bengal (hvad kalder vi det paa dansk?).. Vi kan naa at fange solopgangen da vi ankommer meget tidligt om morgenen. Jeg glaeder mig, det er fantastisk smukt siger folk.

Foerst skal vi lige naa at se Madurai dog. Her i Madurai finder man det kaemplestore tempel Meenakshi Temple for den fiskeoejede, gudinde med tre bryster som jeg ikke lige kan huske navnet paa lige nu. Hun blev foedt med tre bryster, og proffetien sagde at det tredje bryst ville smelte naar hun moedte hendeskommende mand. Det skete da hun moedte Shiva, den hinduistiske gud der er ansvarlig for alt hvad de sker paa jorden, en af de vigtigste guder i Hindu religionen.

Jeg maa sige, jeg er paa mange maader fascineret af hvor komplet meningsloest dette land er. Altsaa, enorme paladser, moskeer og templer. Enorme! Men lige ved siden af disse fantastiske bygninger ligger der mennesker og sover i deres egen affoerring, uden at nogen tager notits af det.

En ting er at det er en del af deres kultur osv osv. Men helt aerligt, det haenger ikke sammen at nogle ting fungerer fuldstaendigt flydende, imens andre ting simpelthen er ved at falde fra hinanden. Naa men nok om det, lad mig slutte af med en lille festivals historie:



En aften i Mysore gik vi en tur, og hoerte musik fra en sidegade. Vi gik derned, og moeder en flok mennesker der staar og stirrer paa to smaa drenge der bliver holdt oppe ved skuldrene af to voksne maend. De to drenge har en form for tavle omkring deres hals med nogle hindu guder afbilledet.

Der bliver trommet helt vildt, og de her to drenge hopper op og ned i total ekstase og ligner nogen der er ved at besvime. Naar de bliver for traette til at hoppe loefter maendene dem bare indtil de kan selv igen.

Bagved deer der en lang raekke religioease maend i en form for hellig dragt der bestaar af et roedt kleade. Det lader til at en af kravene for at kunne baere dette er at vaere lidt for tyk til at det rigtigt kan daekke, men de er vist meget vigtige mennesker.

Saa foelger der en kaempe vogn fuld af blomster og offergaver til en gud (er ikke sikker paa hvilken, det var en meget lille figur i stolen oppe paa vognen) med nogle enorme trae hjul, der bliver hevet frem af diverse frivillige ved hjaelp af kaempe reb. Hjulene saa hele tiden ud til at vaere ved at falde af. Nogle af de anatte i templet begyndte saa at smadre kokosnoedder ned i jorden saa maelk og kokosnoed sproejtede til alle sider, hvilket alle boernene loeber hen for at faa fat paa. Derefter loeber de alle sammen efter en eller anden fyr med en kurv af banener paa hovedet som han kaster efter dem.. Alle griner, vi er totalt maaloese. En hel del kvinder graeder naar vognen kommer taet paa, og de giver deres lille kurv med frugt osv til at ofre til den lille figur af en gud.

Vognen triller forbi (ikke i flyvende fart som man nok kan forestille sig) og efterlader ikke andet end lidt blomsterblade og sinddsygt meget kokos over det hele paa gaden.

Tom og jeg kiggede paa hinanden. trak paa skuldrene og gik ud for at finde noget mad. Hvad kan man sige, this is India.

Arrival


After blast of from Colombo airport we have hardly been mid air for half an hour, when the pilot announced that we should prepare for landing (hence also a really sad and small lunch we got on the aeroplane: pack of nuts and a small pack of apple juice, not impressed, not at all 😊 Sorry Umar, no new photos for you.).So an hour later we touched ground in India, more exactly at the Tiruchirapali airport.

We were standing in line, to have our passports checked, when we noticed 2 rooms with glass doors and 2 beds in them: they were his and hers Entry refusal room. It kinda sends shivers down your spine when you are still waiting in line and we started thinking, how horrible it would be, if we got locked up, as it looked like you were in a zoo of some sorts, everyone could take a peek and see what you are up to. Next to the rooms was of course also an Interrogation room. Welcome to India, eh?

When it was finally our turn, the man demanded arrival forms, which we didn't have. Funnily enough, everyone got one at
Roof
the Colombo airport, except for us. So we had to go back in line and this Indian woman filled out the forms for us. Back in line and we were finally heading towards baggage claim. We took our backpacks and were on our way out of the airport, when we were stopped and asked to produce yet another paper, so we can take our bags out. We had the paper, so we were finally out and met a huge and persistent crowd of tuk tuk drivers. According to our guide book, there were local buses going from the airport to town, so we went to the main road and waited. In the end, tired and a bit confused we took a tuk tuk driver to get us to “Trichy”.
Trichy


We entered into a complete chaos, but it was not time to sit down yet, we had to find a place to stay first. So off we were: first place had rooms available, but when Jan and I went to check one, it only took one look and we almost ran out of the hostel. Next one: full, next one: full, next one: full...you get the picture from here
Madurai temple(s)
onwards. We walked to about 8 different hostels, all were full (apparently there was some big wedding in town for the weekend), one of them was only for business purposes (you know, “business”, when you rent the room for half an hour 😊), and then we found one. It was a bit more expensive, but it was clean, and they had room (Ashby hotel, 800rp per night)..

OK, to the next mission: finding food. There were loads of local restaurants, so we walked into one that was quite packed, we wanted to sit down, when we were told to move to another room, so we did, and we were told to move to another room, a compartment, which was completely separate from the rest of the place, it was closed up, but it did have AC. We felt so weird, we turned and left. And we went to the neighbour, where we were so nicely welcomed and there was no problem with where we could or could not sit. In that first restaurant, we discovered the joys of eating with your hands: your food is served on a banana leaf, and whatever you order is thrown on that leaf,
Portrait no 1.
People asked us to take their photos all the time. Unlike in Indonesia we didn't have to pose with them
and then the fun starts, you mix your rice with different curries, and stuff your face with the assistance of your right hand. AWESOME, I will never eat with a fork and a spoon any more 😊 (although I lied, I just ate muesli with a spoon this morning).

So, that was that for our first day in Trichy, I think all we did, was check out the bus station and the schedule for the buses for our next destination, and that was it. Oh, wait. Another thing we discovered in India: real coffee, Indian coffee, with loads and loads of REAL milk. Yum, yum.

The next day we had plenty of time, before we had to check out (in India hotels don't have a designated check out time, you rent your room for 24 hours). So we decided to at least do something in Trichy and we went to see the famous fort. Arriving to town centre with a local bus, fun, fun, fun, we stepped onto a street and were finally greeted by India. Jan was walking around saying: “I am loving it. I am taking it all in. It's crazy, but I love it!” And
Portrait no 2.
it was chaotic, but it's the kind of chaos, that is, well, endearing. People wearing colourful clothes, so many different noises, people staring at you, but never impolitely, just out of pure curiosity. Walking the gazillion stairs to the top of the fort, there were so many locals, who just wanted Jan to take a picture of them, all smiling like little children.

After experiencing the phenomenal views of the city from the fort, we went back to the hostel, picked up our stuff and went to the bus station, hoping we wouldn't have to wait long for the bus. We got there, they hauled us up to a bus and literally 5 minutes after arriving to the bus station we were on our way to Madurai.
Madurai


They told us the bus ride to Madurai should last about 4 hours, so I braced myself to spend the next 5 to 6 hours on the bus. But I was proven wrong, only 3,5 hours later we arrived to our second destination in India, Madurai. We chose a hostel from the guide book and were lucky for a change, they had room, the price was reasonable and it

was clean. Score!!! Oh, the name of the place is Sri Devi, and we wre paying around 450rp.

Madurai is one of the oldest cities in south Asia and is known for the vast and colourful temples of Sri Meenakshi – Sundareshwarar Temple. We were actually staying just round the corner, so we took a sneak peek the first day.

The next day, looking for a good local place to get breakfast, the hotel manager suggested we go to a place called Modern Restaurant, which became our main food supplier for the next 2 days. The place was nothing special, just one of the local restaurants, but the people there were so nice, and it was always packed with locals, so that it always a good sign. We completely gave up on having normal breakfast, so we are getting into the habit of starting our day with one of the local bread substitutes (dosa, poori, parota, chapati – all so very yummy) and some curry. We would stop again at the restaurant for the mid – day meal (meals are divided into 3 parts in India, specific food available for breakfast, ready meals for lunch, and then another
Trichu - view from the temple
group of food for dinner). Mid – day meal is awesome and fun, as you get to be a bit messy again. You buy a coupon first, than sit your ass down and the procession of men bringing individual food items begins: you get your banana leaf first, then the rice man brings you rice, slam dunk, it's on your “plate”, the curry man brings 4 saucepans around, and puts a ladle of each of the sauces/curries on top of your banana leaf, then the padam man comes round, and you get one on top of your rice – unless you are Jan and are crazy about padams (tastes and looks like huge crisps) and you get 2, and another man brings you a different kind of sauce that you use to moisten your rice, and then last but not least, you get the sweets. And then you can dig in and make a huge mess and enjoy the food, which is of course eaten with your hands. 😊 You can tell I love the meals.

OK, enough of food. We went around the temples the next day, which were just amazing, so colourful, but the majority of the
Internet caffe
Batteries to allow PCs to work during many, many power cuts
action was taking place around the four towers (that are placed in a vast rectangle in the middle of the city). You can always count on masses of people gathering around the temples, there are many shops there, families sitting down on the pavements, people chatting...you could just sit down and observe. Oh, and I got my first batch of expensive jewellery there: 5 bracelets, which are changing shape every day and cost around 30rp (about 40cents) and a “wedding ring” (cheap piece of …), for 10 rp – I need to seem to be married, as I will get less attention that way, apparently. 😊

After seeing the main sight we were already looking at how to get to our next destination and we went to get some info from the main train station, where we found out, it wasn't as easy as we though. You have to wait in a long line first, to not purchase a ticket, but to get on the waiting list. Then, after you purchase the fake ticket, you are asked to come back in the evening, so thy can confirm your ticket and establish whether you can travel or not. Lucky for
Coffee, coffee, coffee
Can be found at any corner..for 7rp,
us that we are tourists, as they have some special quotas for tourists and you usually get a bed or a seat on the train. But we saw people booking 1, 2, 3 months in advance. We had the fake ticket, but then Jan found a store that sells Canon cameras, specifically dSLRs. He was really sad when our camera broke and was so thrilled with the idea that he could purchase an SLR camera and use it for the remainder of the trip. So we decided to stay in Madurai for another night (as they were expecting a camera next day. They had one SLR only), which meant, it was back to the train station for me, trying to explain we were not travelling that evening.

And some more admin followed. They can't just change the date on the ticket, so they told me, I have to fill out a cancellation form, cancel the ticket, come back the next day, fill out the reservation form, and get the “fake” ticket again. I decided to try my luck, so I filled out both forms, made sure I went to a male clerk behind the counter and played on my
Tree baskets
“damsel in distress” card. And it worked, we got the fake ticket on that same evening.

The next day was camera purchasing day. But things got a bit complicated: according to Jan's research the price was a bit high, we could not get any money from the ATM, and when we wanted to pay by card, they wanted to charge an extra 2%. Nothing went right, and Jan completely lost all will to even look at the camera. So we decided it would wait, and that our little Canon camera will have to do. I am happy with that, but Jan, the artist, is not to thrilled about the outcome. But the photos he is taking are still amazing, so I hope it will do for him.

We were pretty much just wondering around for the remainder of the day, waiting for the train (22.50 departure). When we got to the train station and located our carriage we were a bit surprised when we saw the sleeper. It was just so funny and weird, but after we climbed on the top level (you literally felt as if you were sleeping on a bunk bed in a submarine), it
More portraits
was actually quite comfy and to be honest, I slept like a baby. We departed on time (shockingly) and 9 hours later, we were in Varkala.

Driving directions to Madurai is simple.Drive towards Electronic City and you are on NH7.Drive straight on NH7 - the road goes straight to Kanyakumari passing through Salem Madurai. Madurai is about 450 Kms from Bangalore it will take maximum 5.30 hours.The road is 4 lane you have to cross 7-8 tolls and shell out Rs 500 till Madurai.I was able to manage 120Km/hr till madurai with small breaks did Bangalore Madurai in 4.30 hrz.

1 hour we lost in Madurai city to find out directions for Rameshwaram.Madurai to Ramehswaram is 180 kms and its 2 lane NH in very good condition but you cant mantain the same speed you did Bangalore - madurai.Another 3 hrz to to Rameshwaram.

Rameshwaram is a small laid back temple town of religious importance- wrong, its not just the temples you will find the finest beaches here in Rameshwaram.Check out the map of Rameshwaram, 1 side its Indian Ocean other side its Bay of Bengal.You can see 2 different colors mixing into 1.1 day you can easily spend on the beach and 1 day visit temple.

Train to Coimbatore
Soon filled up with talkative travellers to a major city, albeit completely unknown to me.
I’m writing this on the train from Kochi. Around me is a cacophony of enthusiastic conversations (men’s and women’s voices) in Indian language(s) and the faint English conversations of our group. Every few minutes tea and coffee vendors walk quickly through the car chanting, “Chai Chai Chai” or Coffee Coffee Coffee”. We are in a “second class air condition chair” car. It has been specially cleaned because a government minister is travelling on it. The interior is somewhat worn and the windows are dirty, but the seats are comfortable.

Outside pass the scenes common to our travels, although now the proportion is more towards fields and plantations and only a few villages, no doubt because of the constraints in laying tracks. (10:10 a.m.)

I am now writing in bed (with a hot water bottle at my feet to ward off the 5° chill) in Ooty, after a day of hard but exciting travel. Getting off the train in Coimbatore was adrenaline inducing. We were asked by our organizers to disembark immediately to allow room for the porters to get our cases down from the overhead racks and off the train. This was a five-minute stop. My case came off
Porters
Thankfully all our cases were taken from the train before it picked up speed!
first to my relief. Trouble was, of course, that people were trying to get on the train at the same time. Three porters struggled mightily, but the train started with the three porters and two cases still on. JK vociferously demanded the porters complete their job, while two of our group gasped in fear of losing their belongings. The slow departure speed did let the porters bundle the cases and themselves out the door.

Our new driver consulted with JK and L__, who had to announce there was no time for lunch. The train was late and traffic was bad because of Republic Day (Independence Day). L__ stopped the bus to buy oranges and bananas and cookies, and a bit later for a toilet in a hotel (very clean squat toilet). Then we battled horrendous roads – some under construction, some thoroughly deteriorated. After about an hour we were on to the new road – still rough (maybe it’s the bus springs) but much faster. We had another train to catch.

Fairly suddenly, we were rising fast into the Nilgiri mountains, completely forested or cultivated and quite high – elevation about 3000 metres in Ooty. The road was

Seen from the train, a local hotel for visitors to the hill country.
twisty and much narrower than our roads, with cars, buses, tuktuks and motor cycles passing each other and the trucks. Ignoring the dangers required complete faith in the driver plus a studied concentration on the beauty of the vistas. The views were stunning – folds of the earth clothed in greenery and swathed in what could have been translucent mist – but which was smoky pollution all the way to the top. Very disconcerting. The most thrilling view near the top was an almost vertical hillside draped with Flamboyants in bloom! Once in a lifetime!

At Coonoor we got on a small train to climb to Ooty. Thanks to aggressive driving, we were more than half an hour early. This train didn’t seem to take luggage (maybe a separate car), and in each compartment there were eight people, almost knees touching. (The driver and bus went by road, so this train ride was an entertainment.) Once we started it was quite exciting – the views alternated cut-banks and deep, wide mountain vistas. All the windows – more like window walls – were open. We all hung out, taking pictures, most of which probably won’t turn out because of the

We got underway after checking that the cows were not hurt by being bumped by the train.
speed – always a tree in focus when the camera snapped. I kept switching from video to still cameras, unable to decide which was better, until I gave up and just enjoyed the ride. There were several stations along the way, because this is a transportation method for hill residents. We contributed to pollution with chugs of black smoke, supplemented on steep grades by flames coming out of the train’s coal-fired engine. Surprising to me was the number of hill towns – only a few minutes between each.

After an hour we were in Ooty, and a five-minute drive brought us to the Savoy Hotel: 180 years old, once a school, and for 100 years a hotel. Guest cottages in rows were scattered about the grounds where by day many lawn activities were organized. We only had time for a rest before the well-served set menu dinner, which included delicious white fish, fried in butter.

Hotel 1
Travel Period - Mar to Apr 2009

Chennai, Mahabalipuram & Kancheepuram

This was my 2nd trip to India. A very short trip indeed.

We arrived in Chennai International Airport and our pre-booked vehicle was waiting for us. We had a grand welcome from the hotel (Ambica Empire) - presenting us with garlands 😊

The check-in was quick and we got settled in our room. The weather was very humid and staying in an air-con room was a neccessity. We had hired a driver to bring us around for our trip. We had lunch (typical south indian Thali) and it was absolutely delicious and cheap!

After that, we did the usual touristy stuffs:

(1) Spencer Plaza

(2) Marine Beach (super crowded)

(3) MGR memorial (both my parents were fans of his movies)

After this, we went for a bit of shopping for indian traditional clothes.

We left early the next morning for our next 2 destinations, Mahabalipuram and Kancheepuram. We will just stop by these areas as we need to reach Madurai by night fall. In Mahabalipuram, we stopped by one of the temples which had really nice hand craftings on the
hotel 2
stones. All these must have been done by the hands of some gifted scuplturer. Next, we arrived into Kancheepuram where we stopped by a store/factory and the owner showed us how Kancheepuram (famous worldwide) silk is being made. You would be expecting a big factory with big machines doin the silk but it wasnt. It was in a small room and each corner of the room were 2 machine, obviously made up of wood and the worker , an old man was doing it manually. Amazing!!

We reached Madurai at night time just time for dinner. We stayed over for a night at GRT Regency. The next morning, we made our way to the famous Meenakshi Amman Temple. This huge temple was estimated to have 33,000 sculptures in the temple. We had to pay a small sum to be nearer to the deities than the rest of the devotees (it happens in India when you are a tourist or rich). We did walked around the temple and noticed many beautifully painted sculptures.

Chennai itself was a crowded city with horns blazing its way through just like any other cities in India. The people are very warm. Although I
hotel 3
only spent a day or 2 in chennai and its cities, I hope to come back and spend more time on the streets and taking in the sights as well.

Ooty 1
Travel Period - Mar to Apr 2009

We arrived at Ooty just in the nick of time. Why? Its because on that day, it was ""Save The Earth Day"" and all electricity will be cut temporarily and we wouldnt have managed to check-in.

Our trip from Madurai to Ooty was a bumpy one. The roads were so narrow yet the driver skillfully managed to manuvore the vehicle well. As we were reaching higher, we could glance down and see how high we were. People with fear of heights will definately shiver at the look of it. As nighttime falls, the temperature dipped further. We had a minor accident on our way up. Another vehicle was speeding behind us and hit our car, near the bumper. There was a small fight, well just verbal one as my dad and uncle were there to back up the driver.

We checked-in and were given lots of candles to lit when the lights went off. We got a room that gave us a view of the bonfire that the hotel arranged for all the guests. We were too tired from all our travelling that we just stayed in our room.

The
Ooty 2
next morning, we had lots of sightseeing to do. We had breakfast first, variety was that great. Then did some snooping around the hotel and took pictures. We headed to the Lake where there was also a bazaar and market as well. We did some shopping and Ooty is famous for its nilgeri oil for all ailments. I managed to catch the toy train (actual train) which looked very cute.

Well, this sums up my trip to India. I must admit that this was indeed a really short trip due to my work. India, as always, as been interesting. I hope to explore other parts of India, especially the northern states and of course Taj Mahal.

Temple Ooty
So as I said last time have moved on to Ooty. Passed through two Tiger reserves on the way here, didn't see any tigers, not that I expected to as we were on the main road through the middle of it, but did see a few deer, a few dozen eagles and about four million monkeys. I also saw a jackal but that was in the car park of the guest house not in the park. There was sign at the entrance to the park telling drivers not to blow thier horns so as not to scare the animals. That was one big waste of a sign. Horn blowing while driving is like some form of tourettes here and no amount of signs is going to change that.

Ooty's nice and warm in the day but can get very chilly even cold at night. Despite this nowhere seems to have any heating so in the restaurants at night everyone is sat there in thier hats and coats. Ooty town itself is ok but nothing special. Like most places Iv'e seen in India there seems to have been very little thought put into town planning/building. So Ooty sits like some grubby
Sugar Cane sellers
little scar of concreate boxes and open sewers surrounded by fantastic countryside. All rolling hills, tea plantations and mist cloaked forest. Its a shame really you just have the feeling it could be so much better.

I spent most of my time there out of town and up in the hills which was fantastic except i need a better set of legs.

Apparently it used to be called ""snooty Ooty"" back durring the days of British rule as all the rich colonials used to decamp up here when it got to hot down on the plains.

It was the festival of Pongal while I was there which from what I could gather is a sort of harvest festival. All the cows were spruced up to look their best with a quick wash and painted horns. Sugar cane seemed to be big on the menu with everyone taking bags of it home and some places hanging it outside. The cleaning ladies at the guest house all drew designs outside the door which I took a rather rubbish picture of. Out of Ooty I saw a few elephants also all done up in their finery which would have made
Pongal Pictures
a nice picture but I was tearing by at break neck speed on a bus at the time.

So all in all Ooty town I could take or leave but the surrounding countryside is great for walking and if you've got a wooly hat the climate is perfect. And if you do make it here kabab korner is great for tandoori of any kind.

Said at the begining that i was now in Ooty which I was when I started writing this but have now moved on again and arrived yesterday in Fort Cochin in Kerala which at first look is just my sort of place. More about that next time.

Birthday Dawn
For a January baby, this is bliss!
My birthday surprise was sitting in the private outdoor shower at 6:15 a.m., enjoying the pre-dawn calls of birds. Then, on the front veranda of my chalet, the chorus diminished as the deep orange sun rose directly in my view east, through pink and blue tinged clouds over the Bay of Bengal. The surf pounded strongly giving a constant auditory sense of heavy rain, although the day is fine and the temperature is suited to sitting outside.

Birthday celebrations continued through lunch. At breakfast our fellow travellers wished me Happy Birthday, as did a German woman who overheard them, and also my special chef (sous-chef he murmured once). Suffering mightily from allergic reaction to the perfume in my room, I went outside to the fresher air on the veranda for breakfast, where L__ joined me, as eventually did V__. After I had already consumed fruit bread and omelet, my chef came around greeting guests and offered to make me another dish. Too flattered to refuse, I happily consumed a delicious dosa with turmeric-coloured potato salad, white coconut sauce and green coriander sauce - the colours of the Indian flag.

The bus took us to Mahabalipuram, affording views
Krishna's Butter Ball
All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't move Krisha.
of morning life in the villages: women walking in colourful saris, men enjoying breakfast, shop keepers of both genders opening up for the day.

At the archeological park, we first stopped at a rock called “Buddha’s Butter Ball”, a gigantic round rock perched in what looks like a precarious manner on a hill of rock; however, even when they had put all the soldiers around to the task, the colonial British had failed to move it. At the end of a short walk along on to the granite hill, we viewed carvings of the gods in what was called a cave, although it was more a depression in the rock. As with yesterday, several of the main and most intricately carved gods, such as Shiva and Parvati, were in niches, with small amounts of vegetable dye still visible.

Our next visit was at a marvelous high relief carving, the largest after Anchor Wat, according to the guide. The story of the long penance of Arjuna was portrayed with numerous gods represented as animals supporting him in the jungles of the Himalayas. Large elephants dominated the foreground, and Shiva towered over the emaciated Arjuna, who stood on one leg without food

Marvellous carving extending 29 metres long and 13 metres high. Also known as the Descent of the Ganges.
or water for more than a decade.

Next we visited the five “chariots”, one for each of the five brothers in Mahabarata – oddly the brothers don’t seem to be portrayed at all. Each small temple is dedicated to a god, usually Shiva and Parvati again of course. Also in this complex of temples were beautiful carvings of a relaxed lion, elephant and bull – the last much beyond life size.

In all these temples there were lots of Indian families enjoying the Pongal festival/holiday, which has now extended four days. Women were wearing bright saris, many gold-bordered and figured. No one minds if we take their photos, and quite a few ask us to, even though they will never see the pictures except on the screen of the camera. Some had camera phones and asked for our photos. (This happened a little in Chennai also – very friendly and happy to see tourists.) As the day went on, the crowds grew, and on our way back to the hotel we saw that the police had erected barriers against cars and were also controlling the massive foot traffic.

Our final temple was the Shore Temple on the coast
Varaha Temple

of the Bay of Bengal. The whole park and all along the coast were devastated by the 2004 Christmas Day Tsunami, but all is now restored and the people are better off, according to the guide, with their new houses and boats. Although the Shore Temple is an archeological site, as were the others today, some people treated the altars as active places of worship. Most people just tramped around looking at the intricate carvings.

The temple complex has been eroding through the centuries, with apparent old attempts at control, pre-dating concrete. None of these temples have the carved towers of more recent temples, but each of the three sections has a sacred centre with a carving to be worshiped: a reclining Vishnu and two Shivas.

Now was time for a little shopping. We stopped for a few minutes to look at a shop that sold mass-market replica stone carvings. Our real destination was a small shop kept by a master carver where he sells the work of his students. These intricate carvings of Shiva, Parvati and Ganesha, and many more were done in the round, not with unfinished, flat backs as in the first store.

Lunch was at a
Mahabalipuram
One carved structure for each of the brothers in the Mahabarata. Hard to learn the story; easy to admire the artistry.
beachside resort under a festival tent. I bought wine and beer for all to celebrate the day (about $36 or 1726 rupees for ten people). Three of us shared a bottle of Indian Sauvignon Blanc. The buffet lunch was good, with lots of variety, but we had been spoiled by some previous spectacular buffet meals. We rounded off the experience by shopping in a nearby clothing store, where I bought a pajama (loose pants) for 200 rupees ($4) to relax in hotel rooms.

Which is what I did upon returning to the hotel. I was quite tired, as I haven’t been sleeping well because of being sensitive to the scents they use for “refreshing” the room. With front door and door to the shower open to air the room, I lounged outside on the swinging bed with the remainder of Sharpe’s Trafalgar to read (didn’t quite finish it). When the sun got too hot I went to the very large free-form pool and swam all the way round a few times, lounging in-between. Surprisingly, with the pool and deck in the shade and an onshore breeze, I was too cold and had to return to my room.

Who wouldn't be jealous of such a colourful new village!
This did give me time to pack for tomorrow.

As a surprise after dinner, the chef brought out a birthday cake; I blew out a couple of candles and cut the first piece. By now even the wait staff knew I couldn’t eat the cream-filled cake. And, the surprise was thin because L__ had to reveal the secret at lunchtime when the waiter tried to get me to order a cake then. A card signed by all was indeed a nice surprise. A memorable day.

Leaving Chennai
Love the vivid colours and wild juxtapositions!
We left Chennai in good time, about 9:00, to drive for about two hours on bumpy roads with occasional smooth interludes. As we drove out of the city, we saw many private universities and hospitals, most specializing in one or a few disciplines. Most were examples of the newest and boldest buildings in the city; they were set amongst innumerable squat, cement buildings. Fairly often a temple, some small some large, would appear amongst the jumble and, occasionally they were also gateways into the commercial-looking compounds of gurus.

Gradually the view became more rural, although never unpopulated. Villages seemed to be accumulations of buildings with a few vendors and shops. Large, modern, and multi-storied buildings in compounds indicated the landlord’s home. Because of the Pongal holiday, no one was working in the fields. Often women were wearing red saris in celebration, and sometimes men were wearing red shirts.

As predicted, the roads were bumpy and slow to travel. For a while the highway was just rather rough. Then the road was deteriorated asphalt – inches-deep ruts on the sides, potholes, and broken pavement. Thus we came to Kanchipuram, home of the best silk weavers and best sari collections. Along

the street for about a kilometre or more were open-fronted shops spilling colourful saris and fabrics for men’s clothes. Vendors flapped open the tightly folded cloths for customers to examine. Ranks of parked motorbikes (or two-wheelers as they are called here) hemmed in customers and vendors alike.

Our stop brought us to an indoor store, Sri Varadha Silk House. On the nearest counter were heaps of silk scarves. I asked immediately about the saris and was ushered over to another counter. Before leaving Calgary I had used paint-tint-cards from Home Depot as samples to decide on a tangerine orange and mahogany wine red for curtains/drapes in the living room and dining room, so I was able to be quite specific in my choices – so specific that the seller asked me to come round the counter to point at exactly the ones I wanted to see. The orange one was easy to pick but the dark red was harder. The first I thought would do was truly expensive, so he pulled another that I actually preferred because the gold was in a leaf pattern, not polka-dots. The saris are folded tightly in a standard shape about 8”x12” – incredible

since they are 48”x6 metres. As small “packets”, about two dozen were neatly stacked on each shelf. One of my saris included an additional metre for the blouse and one did not. Our country guide, JK, was concerned and was chiding the seller and warning me. I leaned over the counter to advise him sotte voce that I was going to make drapes. He visibly brightened and said that gave him an idea, because his wife had 250 saris and wore none!

Then commenced the bargaining. We got partway through, with me having trouble figuring the dollar equivalent – shouldn’t have been difficult, because there are about 50 rupees to the dollar. That’s what stress does for you! As I learned in my lessons in negotiating, I deflected by going to the scarf pile to add to my purchases. The seller actually came over and said they were waiting for me! I maintained my semi-indifference, curtailed my usual desire to give in too soon, and got them all for a price that made the storeowner a bit annoyed – must be right! From over 12,000 rupees down to 9500 rupees ($190), below which he would not go. A happy
Khambaranathar Temple

time!

On to the real event of the day, the Sri Ekambareswarar Temple, an overwhelming structure. The temple tower rises so far into the sky that you have to bend backwards to see it. Outside the entrance we deposited our shoes at a shop that sold a variety of small items and also provided this shoe service. Throughout this large temple were many large carvings of Shiva and his many attributes. At one side shrine, after a donation, a “guru” blessed us with sandal wood paste. Around the perimeter were 1080 (magic number) Shiva lingams.

Our next visit was to the small Makshi Temple on what seemed to be a small side street. We removed our shoes in the bus and walk along the street with a fair number of celebrants. Again, the women were glowing in their red saris decorated with gold borders. Several stalls were doing a brisk business selling souvenirs and objects or fruit to be used as offerings for worship. The temple itself was small and we didn’t go inside, just walked around the courtyard. Most exciting was the decorated elephant near the gate. It was very tame but generated lots of laughter and giggles

In fairly short order we were back on the bus, feeling rather hot and dusty. Nevertheless, on to the next temple! Kailasanatha Temple is now an archeological site, dating from the eighth century in the Pallava dynasty. The sandstone has worn down, although there is one section showing how hundreds of years ago a restoration was done, surviving as a blackened surface on the old sandstone. Current restorations are underway using a slightly lighter coloured stone to show where the new supplements the old. The meditation niches preserved the lively carvings of Shiva very well, one with a bit of paint left, indicating that we are seeing much less than once was. Few people were visiting this temple, letting the peace settle into me, and giving us a very close look at the intricate designs and carvings.

Finally we had a short stop to see a master weaver at work on a gold-bordered sari. The gold is around a silk core, providing a thread that is woven into the fabric itself. Weaving is a highly skilled craft, and this weaver worked in a space just big enough for the loom and himself.
Sacred Elephant
At Makshi Temple this well-cared-for elephant delighted all of us.
Of course, because of the holiday, almost no one else was at work.

Another couple of hours on the bus brought us to the fabulous resort of Fisherman’s Cove. Each person has a spacious chalet with a veranda furnished by table, chairs, and swinging daybed, and a private outdoor “rain” shower. Within my view, the surf of the Bay of Bengal pounded a hypnotic rhythm. After a rest, I did dabble in the waves, pursued in a desultory manner by a single vendor of souvenirs. But my swimming was in the pool because the sea flag was red.

Unfortunately I have a horrible and severe allergic reaction to the cleaning products and warm oil mosquito repellant used in the chalet. Even leaving the doors open to the clear air inside is almost futile.

For some pleasant yet unidentified reason, one of the chefs showed me particular favour this evening. He was most solicitous of my dairy-free diet and thus made my visit very personal. He asked if I wanted him to make a special dish for dinner, to which I said yes, of course. It was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten, but I have no

Kapaleeshwarar Temple
We started late this morning, thank goodness. Breakfast was a plentiful buffet with many Indian and Western choices. I had a peppery Indian bean stew with bacon and toast, and papaya and a fingerling banana.

Our tour took us first to the Kapaleeshwarar Temple. Our first experience of removing our shoes and putting on the “spare” socks we were advised to bring. We entered the temple complex, which was dominated by a huge Hindu temple tower. This is a flat-sided, sugar-loaf shape, covered with fabulous, painted carvings of the Hindu gods, particularly those related to Shiva (as this is South India). Several other smaller roofs were similarly covered with carvings. We walked the short distance to one of these, the wedding hall - basically a large veranda-type place where the wedding party would congregate. We walked around the main temple, as did many others because this was the Festival of the Sun, a Hindu holiday long-weekend. (Pongal Festival) On one side was a corral for about eight cinnamon-coloured cows. One of the worship areas (no photos allowed) was dedicated to the nine planets, so there were nine statues about eighteen inches tall arranged inside a kiosk. The worshippers walked around it three times:

detail
once for self, once for family, once for community. We walked around it once. The main worship area was virtually hidden by a line of people waiting to do their devotions; this area was forbidden to non-Hindus.

Back on the bus, we drove through the streets, which were not too full because of the holiday. Everyone was wearing their best clothes. Women were very attractive in their deeply dyed, gold-edged saris. Many children had clothes made of silk and gold sari fabric. Flower-sellers made more colour on the streets with their yellow and red carnations.

The bus drove along Marina Beach, 13 km long and apparently the second longest in the world. Lots of people were walking along in their bright clothes. We passed through the Fort St George area where the British enclave was. And arrived at San Tome, or the St Thomas Basilica, which is reputed to be built over the remains of Thomas the Apostle, although our professor says scholars dispute this. Nevertheless, we went down into the museum and crypt for St Thomas – where they were about to celebrate First Communion for a girl. We were allowed to view the special St Thomas cross, and they waited for us.
Shakti peacock


Upstairs and out again, we walked around the pure white neo-Gothic church shining beautiful in the sun. Since this was Sunday a service was underway, with the most melodious congregational singing.

Back on the bus we returned to Fort George and the Fort Museum, which is a three storey stone building with the galleries around a long atrium. It now houses an impressive collection of Chola dynasty carvings of Shiva and the associated gods, such as Parvati, his wife, and Ganesha, her son. (Ganesha in part represents that all humans and animals are part of the same spirit.) With endless repetition, I am beginning to identify some gods by their symbols. This is made more difficult by each one having several symbols and a number of avatars. Shiva is associated with snakes, particularly cobra. The museum also has a number of lingams, of which we will see many more tomorrow.

Lunch was in an ultra-modern, large restaurant with an excellent buffet featuring a wide variety of Indian foods both vegetarian and non, a few Chinese dishes and a few Western. Attentive and friendly waiters served the soup and appetizers. Although some people really liked the “Indian bread”,
Flower seller
I didn’t as it had little flavour and a heavy texture. I saw them making it by drizzling concentric rings of dough on to a griddle to shape a five-inch flat bread.



Returning to the hotel, V___ offered to include anyone who wanted in his walk around town. D___ and I were enthusiastic, although the others wanted to nap. The walk was longer than I expected, from 3:00 – 5:30. At first V___ was in search of two shopping malls. The very near one was Spencer Mall, which was a bit dim inside with a fair number of customers for the sari, jewelry and clothing stores. I stopped to look at some scarves, was lured in and successfully bargained for a lovely pale turquoise and pink shawl, down from 2000 rupees (ridiculous) to 400 - he would not go lower. Now V___ was interested in finding Express Avenue, for which he received contradictory directions. I was struck by how easy it is for him to approach men in the street and quickly ask and move on. With minimal retracing of our steps, crossing a huge intersection without being run over (there were lights, which helped), and avoiding being
San Tome Basilica
run down by speeding tuktuks on the side streets, we discovered the big new mall, which is not on Express Avenue but which is named Express Avenue.

Lots of young men and women and families were strolling in the mall, enjoying the holiday. Some of the stores were American or European chains, such as Levis. This didn’t interest us. As we left the mall, D___ somehow struck up a conversation with a doctor and his son, who wanted their photo taken on the son’s iPhone. Photos and extended greetings all around.

Now V___ wanted us to go Marina Beach, which required a tuktuk ride. He speaks Hindi and quickly arranged for us to squeeze into the passenger seat of a three-wheeled transport scooter with a yellow-cab canopy and body. We rushed through the traffic of cars, tuktuks, motorbikes, and buses. Hard to believe I was actually taking such a risk and enjoying the company that enabled a behaviour both bizarre (to me) and common (to Indians).

At our destination of the Gandhi monument, we took photos and walked out onto the sand – maybe about 400-500 yards across. Many vendors of ice cream, kid’s rides, balloons, and other seaside
Pongal kolam
Chalk designs seen in public and home places
amusements were doing a desultory business. The beach wasn’t as crowded as I expected. We walked up to some long, narrow fishing boats with their wooden anchors stowed – possibly drag anchors. For the most part, people pursued their own interests and left us to pursue ours.

Now V___ wanted to go to San Thome Basilica again, which we could see in the distance. Like many churches, its tall spire disappeared as we came closer. We walked for about twenty minutes. All directions from passers-by encouraged us to continue straight on, until we recognized the school attached to and across the street from the basilica. This time we could go inside because there was no service on yet. Folk art carved panels depicting the life of Jesus reminded me of the church of the Black Christ in Panama. The church was more brightly lit than any I had ever seen, and it had a relatively simple nave.

Finally we took another tuktuk to the hotel, which was farther away than any of us thought. Now 6:00, there was just time for a brief swim in the deep dusk in an ultra-long outdoor pool. The buffet dinner was extensive with many Indian

vegetarian and non-veg dishes. I fell for the mutton curry – very tender meat and well flavoured.

Railway Museum
I have now left Mysore where I had a great time. Its my favorite city so far.

While there I visited the railway museum which my guide book said was very interesting and well worth half a day. I'd say it was a little bit interesting and well worth half an hour. Never trust the books.

Also had time at the Maharajas palace which was very interesting. Its a little bit of a walk from the gate where you pay to go in and entrance to the palace. Security is quite tight and before they let me in they put my bag through an x-ray machine saw the camera in there, no photography is allowed inside, and I was pulled to one side and told to go back to the main gate and drop it off at a locker. I gave the guard my best ""you've got to be joking look"" slipped him ten rupees with a promise to leave it in my bag and I was in. Once inside I was confronted with a thousand other visiters all snapping away merrily right in front of the guides who took not a blind bit of notice. I bet it
Railway Museum
didn't cost them all ten rupees.

The palace is huge and only part of it is open to the public which is a good job or it would take all day to get round. Its all a bit over the top as far as decoration goes but was well worth the vist.

Had a very nice day out at Mysore zoo. I've been to a lot of very badly run poor zoos in asia but this was a very good one. More monkeys on the outside of the cages as inside.

After a few more days of general wandering I booked a mini bus from Mysore up to Ooty in the Nilgiri hills. It was an early start of what turned out to be a not very good day. I was the first pick up but was assured it would only take 20 minutes to pick up everybody else. It took 2 hours which put me in a bit of a grumpy mood as it wasn't a very comfortable bus. The driver was a lunatic who kept trying to overtake when there was clearly no chance of making it. After a few near death experiances I felt
Mysore Palace
the need to let him know that if he tried to kill me again we'd be having more that a few words.

It was meant to be a direct trip of about four hours but an hour after leaving Mysore we stopped for breakfast, then stopped again to look at some goats then only a few miles from our destination we stopped again for an hour at a lake so everyone could go for a boat ride. I was not best pleased and had a right moan at the bloke in charge. I think the idea was that we'd all get bored and take an auto rickshaw the last few miles into town but stuborness had taken over so I sat it out. Finanly we left for the last little bit of the journey and got within less that a mile of our drop off point when we stopped for lunch!! At this point I went into a purple headed rage which wasn't helped when I was told it was only a five minute walk to where I wanted to be which begged the question why didn,t you drop me off first. As i was close to getting chucked
Temple at Mysore Palace
off the bus anyway I gave up and walked the last bit. So my four hour day had turned into an eight day and I had turned into a miserable old bugger. Oh well I suppose they can't all be good days.

Only been in Ooty for a day so nothing to tell you yet except it gets very cold at night due to the alltitude and I've had to dig my jumper out of the bag for the first time this trip.

Not sure yet where I'm going next but will let you all know when I get there.

Dancing Nataraja
The Dancing Nataraja is an important symbol of India. This statue is in the hotel lobby.
Our 24 hours plus of airports and airplanes wasn’t so bad – I forced myself into a kind of sleep after dinner on the way to Frankfurt. On the way to Chennai I had several genuine naps, interspersed with looking out the window. The sky was clear over most of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. As we went over the Caucasus Mountainsby the Caspian, I finally disturbed my seatmate to get at my camera in the overhead compartment. Just caught the end of the snow capped ridges as the sun set. The pattern of weather was obviously from the northwest as most of the snow was on that side of the mountains in a scene of white and greeny-gray, deepening as the sun set into an orange rim.

The night was deeply black when we arrived in Chennai at about a quarter to midnight. After waiting in the long lineup at immigration and then collecting our luggage, we stepped out into florescent-lit darkness, punctuated by the many horns of the many cars meeting the many passengers. After a few minutes, we walked through the chaos understood only by the Indians to our full-size bus, which drove into the fairly quiet streets of Chennai. First impressions were of lots of one-to-three-storey concrete buildings, all shuttered for the night. I was surprised that there was no unusual smell to the air as there is in Africa.

Our hotel (Vivanta by Taj Connemara) greeted us with garlands and juice. Lovely honey-coloured marble and modern rooms. To bed about 2:30 a.m.

Look out Dad
The tour guide moves in for the kill...
Namaskaram!!



Re-visiting Kerala was, for lack of better descriptors (can someone please forward me some new adjectives other than amazing and incredible? I use these words far too often when I blog!), amazing and comforting. As I mentioned in the last posting, Kerala is really home-y to me and it was nice going back to a couple places that I had been before and sharing them with Mom. We went immediately from Kannur to Fort Cochin, an old colonial-ish town on the coast that I went to once when I was here last time. It's pretty un-India in that there is less traffic and noise than usual and there are lots of old churches and Dutch and Portugese buildings instead of temples. I left Mom to sightsee on her own for the first day since I had pretty much seen everything and I took the day to work on a correspondence course that I'm taking while here (this was a terrible idea on my part – but one that I am resignedly sticking to!). The following day we went on a backwaters boat tour to see some of the countryside that Kerala is famous for.


Toddy!
""Don't worry, it tastes better than it smells!""

The tour was admittedly touristy, but we had a great guide who was really funny and kept hitting on my mom all day – and I kept telling him that I was going to tell my dad about it but the guide just laughed. He is also apparently an Ayurvedic (traditional Indian medicine) doctor so he was taking everyone's pulse and telling them about their health. We took a boat and cruised around the backwaters, these long, interconnecting rivers that function as watery highways that people still use for commerce and for getting around in the remote parts of the state. We also got to drink toddy, which is a local moonshine brew made from the sap of coconut flowers, and smells really bad but tastes good! It ferments throughout the day so that at night when I went to have a little nightcap I loosened the lid of my bottle, the cap shot off and hit the ceiling of my room! I ended up not drinking the rest...



Then came the part of this trip that I have been most looking forward to – visiting Thiruvalla, the village where I volunteered the first time I came
Backwaters
Beauty.
to India, and Santha, my “Indian Mum”, who is hands-down the strongest woman I know. Those of you who read my blogs from last time I was here will know the story (hahaha but you can always go back and re-read it if you need refreshing!), but the short version of it is that Santha is married to an abusive husband but can't get out of the marriage and in trying to help other women and serve as an example she is working for the women's organization, Sevika Sanghom, that I volunteered with last time I was here.



The whole train ride to Thiruvalla my stomach was doing flips, partly because I was excited but also partly that Santha had only gotten the email that we were coming the day before and I didn't want to be a burden on her or interrupt her weekend. The second we saw each other on the train platform though, we broke out into huge smiles and ran towards each other, me dropping my bags all over the place, and just gave each other the hugest hugs, laughing and crying at the same time. It was amazing to me that, 2

years (almost to the day) that I had first arrived in Thiruvalla and met Santha, I was able to come back and visit her again. It also meant the world to me that I was able to introduce my mom and Santha to each other, both of my Moms, living half a world away from each other. It turned out that she had declined going to her cousin's wedding and picking her husband (who is a monster) up from the hospital so that she could come meet our train, but it didn't matter to her because, in her words, “It feels like my daughter is coming home”. Yup, the tears were really going at that point!



We spent the afternoon visiting and getting caught up on all of our news – she showed me pictures of her new granddaughter, I showed her photos of my family, we went for lunch and tea, and we visited a bunch of the places I worked at, in particular the old age home where, astonishingly, a few of the older ladies remembered me and even knew my NAME (I basically did not stop crying the entire time I was there hahaha!!),
Varkala
Let's talk about how painful it was to walk back UP the cliff after a day in 40-degree heat!!
and visiting the home for special-needs girls where I worked, as well as the girls' orphanage. I was really excited to hear that some of the girls are off doing higher education, one of them, Asha, is at school for fashion design and another, Manju, is at teacher training school, and it made me so happy to know that they are getting the chance to do what they might not have been able to do if they hadn't come into the organization.



Mom and I stayed at the volunteers' flat and cooked a delicious dinner (well I cooked) of dhal, chappati, bhindi masala and kozhukattai (which is a rice dumpling stuffed with coconut and jaggery and I am sure I have mentioned it before because it is pretty much the best dessert I have ever had), and Santha complimented me on my cooking and how good it was which made me happy since she was the one who taught me and it was good to know that I still remember everything! It was a really short visit, just overnight, but it was still so special. It felt amazing to go back and visit the vegetable market, the

temple, even just the internet cafe, the places that were a part of my daily life for 2 months while I was going through a period of really intense personal growth and exploration, and being in Thiruvalla brought back so many happy memories of learning how to do the simple things, like laundry by hand every night and cooking from scratch every evening and getting water from the well and all these things that I had to do while I lived there that I had never done before, but that taught me a lot of patience (ahem, a trait that I am still working on and probably still will be working on for the rest of my life!). Seeing Santha was also really special, this woman who is my role-model and someone whose spirit is so strong and so unable to be dominated by her horrific husband, who unfortunately she is still living with but who still continues to threaten to kill her and who continues to have affairs with other women, right in the house. She has not and will not stop fighting against the hand that she was dealt in life and it was so comforting to see
Kanyakumari
Most beautiful sunrise, ever.
that, 2 years later, she is still dreaming big about starting up a little farm and community for women where they can escape and live in peace away from abusive marriages.

After visiting Thiruvalla we went to Varkala, a reeeeeeeeeeally touristy beach resort that, again, I had already been to but that was awesome to see again. Our room had a big balcony with a hammock (Pashu, if you are reading this one, the hammock was much MUCH stronger than that in Kudle (plus I was in it by myself) so it didn't break, but even if it had there was a railing on the balcony so I couldn't have fallen off) and a BATHTUB, which I hadn't even seen since I left Canada, and I was reminded and thankful again for the perks of travelling with Mom, who I have decided is no longer allowed to go out shopping on her own because she has no bargaining skills whatsoever and paid way too much money for a purse and shirt. So now shopping is supervised 😊 . We spent the majority of our time in Varkala on the beach with a nice couple we'd met in Fort Cochin
Sabarimala friends!
They loved Mom!
on the boat tour, Barry and Kelly, who were hilarious, doing a lot of swimming and reading and walking on the beach, and of course having one terrifically epic dance party that featured a middle aged Indian guy doing the splits on the dance floor! It was a very relaxing 2 days but I was getting antsy eating non-spicy food (one of the downers of hanging around in major tourist hotspots) and so we left for Kanyakumari after 3 days.



Kanyakumari is on the tip of India, where the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal all meet and where a ton of spiritual stuff has happened, making it both a pilgrimmage spot and a tourist destination for Indians. It was a weird blend of this very holy temple to the goddess Devi Kumari, who from what I gather was a virgin who seduced Shiva by dancing or something like that (I may be getting this mixed up with Meenakshi, whose temple in Madurai we visited yesterday, who was born with 3 breasts but an astrologer told her father that upon meeting her husband the 3rd breast would disappear; she fought a big war against Shiva's
The usual.
These kids were actually REALLY sweet, but we realized that if we stood in one place for too long we risked never being able to leave due to the sheer number of pictures being taken!
army in the north of India and when Shiva himself came down to see who this goddess was who had beaten back all of his soldiers, her 3rd breast disappeared and they got married), mixed with a bunch of souvenir shops selling mobiles made out of shells that really could have been equally as at home in south Florida. I loved it though, there was something really powerful about being at the end of the country, looking out at the sun rising in the east, with absolutely nothing but open, wildly crashing ocean before you (I'm sure no one will be surprised when I said it brought tears to my eyes, followed quickly by lots of laughter as about 35 people wanted to take their photos individually with me). We also went out to the Devi temple on the ocean, where her footsteps from her dance are said to be, and I can honestly say that there was something REALLY moving about that place, too – when I visited the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem and the spot where Jesus was said to have ascended into heaven, I felt some really powerful energy there too and it was similar to
Pretty wind turbines!
Am I a total loser if I find wind turbines beautiful? Hahahahaha!
what I felt at the temple in Kanyakumari – whether or not a goddess really did dance there and whether or not there really was a Jesus who went up into heaven, I can't say, but I do know that I was hit with the same feeling of the place being really, really sacred and special.



We went by train to Madurai, where there is, as I mentioned above, a huge and gorgeous temple to the goddess Meenakshi and the god Shiva, and it is on this train that I saw thousands upon thousands of wind turbines, looking like big white birds spinning in the sky, and that made me so happy, and also made the single. lone wind turbing at Toronto's waterfront look pathetic by comparison! As usual the train was a full-sensory experience. South India in particular is absolutely gorgeous, with the palms, rice paddies, mountains in the distance, and it is just so lush and verdant and fertile that it fills you up with so much positive energy. Travelling by train right now is also a unique experience due to the sheer number of pilgrims going to Sabarimala, which is a holy place in
Madurai gopura
The unbelievably intricate and gorgeous statues on the entranceway to the Madurai temple.
Kerala that is worshipped by devotees of Ayappa, the son of, incidentally, a gay union between Shiva and Vishnu (well, sort of – the gods wanted to test Shiva to see how good he was at resisting temptation, so Vishnu got all dressed up like a beautiful woman and went to seduce Shiva. The plan backfired though, because apparently Shiva is NOT good at resisting temptation, and a son was born of their get-together, Ayappa) (please also note that my re-telling of the Hindu stories, legends and history is approximate and subject to my own interpretation of things – I told the story of Kali to Chris, a British friend of mine who really IS well-versed in Hindu philosophy, and he burst out laughing at what I had come up with). Sabarimala time sees millions of men dressed in black, barefoot and carrying packs of food, clothes and blankets on their heads, walking and taking the train to the temple that apparently gets almost as many visitors as Mecca!



So the trains are crowded but no less fun and intense, the food is still as spicy as ever and we are leaving tomorrow for Mumbai, where I
Dance off!
My favourite statues in the Madurai temple for sure: Shiva and Meenakshi having a dance-off!
fully intend on finding a role in Bollywood that is a step up from my last role in a commercial with Deepika Padukone and where my mom can make a little pilgrimmage of her own to some of the places mentioned in the book Son of the Circus by John Irving (another excellent read).



Spicy love from Hindustan!

p.s. I have had numerous hilarious exchanges with rickshaw drivers wanting to take us to a place where they get a cut from bringing business to a hotel. It is of course frustrating, but always makes me laugh because of the absurdity of conversations I wind up having. A typical exchange with a commission-seeking rickshaw driver looks like this:



Me: “We would like to go to the New College Guesthouse”



Driver: “Sree Devi Guesthouse?”



Me: “No, New College Guesthouse.”



Driver: “OK, Sree Devi Guesthouse.”



Me: “No, we want to go to New College Guesthouse. No Sree Devi.”



Driver: “Madam, Sree Devi Guesthouse is very good price. We go there.”



Me: sigh....

I realised that I have to hurry up a little bit because my friend Sepp from Kiel wants to visit me in Chennai in about 3 weeks, and if I want to fulfill my plan of going to the very South of Inida it are still 1500km.

Because the days in India are quite short also the distances I make are not so big. Before India it was no problem to ride more than 100km a day. But here I havent made more than 100km in one day except the one day without luggage where I took my MP3 player. After the night at the beach in Goa I decided to make 100km again. And I made it. I was going to the Cotiago Sanctuary in the South of Goa. And it was really nice. I havent seen any leopard or so but it was an awesome silence and nice jungle I was wandering in. So on 31.12. I already was leaving Goa again. Since the alcohol is so cheap in Goa that I bought a bottle of Cashew schnapps. I realised that after the last puncture I have lost my air pump. I couldnt believe it, how could I
DSCF3180
lose my air pump? So I bought in the next town a new pump. It is a really big one! But it is working very fine.

My battery of my bordcomputer was quite empty at least it said so. I changed the battery and it isnt working at all anymore. But dont worry, the stop watch is still working so I can stop my daily riding time. And the distances I estimate by my maps and the road signs. So you still can enjoy my statistics 😊

New years eve I was celebrating with the schnapps and mango nectar. I was awakened by loud biting aunts in the entry of my tent. Unbelievable that they were so loud. But luckily, my tent was closed and they couldnt come into my tent.

In Karnataka, the next state after Goa I just cycled through. Although I was on a National Highway the road was often very bad. And the more I was coming to the South the more noise was on the street. I was often listening to music so it was a bit better. Here the mosquitos are also much more present than in the first days in

wildlife sanctuary in Goa
Maharashtra. I was surprised to have no problems with mosquitos there but now I have to hurry up every evening to build up my tent to flee away from them. However, n the tent is it often very hot and I am sweatening a lot. I start sleeping without any sleeping bag but during the night it is getting colder so that I have to crawl into it.

Some news of my companions: Bert from US cycled in Israel Jordan, Egypt , Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand (with some flights in between) and is now back at home. Chris and Meint made it from Teheran over Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan to Kashgar in China with the cycle. But for both it was too cold and Chris took the train to Beijing and Meint was flying to Nepal where he spent a month as backpacker. I think Chris is continuing to Australia as far as possible with bicycle.

After three days I came into Kerala. Again a different language, different people. The men are often wearing wrap-around skirts. You see again many mosques and women in black clothes. Even the letters are completely different from the devangari alphabet. So I have agaion
DSCF3187
no idea what is written on the signs. I often must think of Europe, also with a unique currency and no passport controls at the borders, but different cultures, different languages, different countries.

I got again many spots as in Serbia for example, I thinkl it is from the heat and the effort. But they have gone again after a few days.

Sometimes I made a rest at a beach. Very nice beaches, often without any person there! But in general it is very crowded along the coast in Kerala. My RoughGuide says it is the most denelky populated region in hole India. And I feel it! There is no place where you can be alone for a few minutes. And then the horrible noise of the crazy honking of everybody. I have no problems with the smell, the chaos, the litter, the heat, mosquitos,... but the noise I cant get used to it. In the evening I had many problems to get a sleeping place. The towns or villages or whatever along the road didnt stop. I was happy when I found a green area in the middle of a town where I could stay. And it

is funny that in such places I was mostly not disturbed the whole evening, night and morning, although all people could see me.

In the middle of Kerala at the coiast there is a little enclave, Mahe, belonging to Puducherry, another very little state. There were many alcohol shops so that I allowed myself a bottle of wine. That night I stayed at a beach. Some locals came and stared at me without saying something or made some fancy movements with their hands that I didnt understand. I thought the one guy wanted to have some food of me. After a while a bigger group came to me and one said to me that there are often snakes. Everywhere snakes! Even at the beach. They showed me a place where no snakes can come to. I tried exceptionally to sleep without a tent but that was a fault. The mosquitos annoyed me muchso I couldnt sleep. At one o'clock or so the police came, wanted to see my passport and was asking what I am doing there. Thei said it was not so safe there, that there are some thieves. I nevertheless wanted to stay there and they said,
DSCF3193
okay but dont complain tomorrow at the police. No problems with any thieves but many problems with the mosquitos!

One evening when I couldnt find a sleeping place I was riding in the night. Was not so bad as I thought and it was quite nice not to have the hot sun. But that was the only evening I did this, else I ride only in the daylight.

Some days it was really hot, it reminded me to the hot days in Turkey. I just went from one juice shop to the next and tried nice fruit juices and shakes and ice creams😊

In Kottayam I decided to go directly to Tamil Nadu and not make the longer way to Trivandrum and then backj to Chennai. The time was getting too close. I had to cross the ghats I was making 1000m elevation in one day. I dont know if I had such steep mountains so far. There were tea plantages everywhere where I also decided to sleep. I thought there was a nice meadow but suddenly my feet were completely sunk in mud. Nice! But I found a dry place to stay. In the night it
DSCF3195
was extremely raining. Once a guy came and said something like Buga, buga, beega, Caruba! Probably Malayam, the language spoken in Kerala. I said ""sleep, sleep""and made the corresponding handsign. ""Buga, Baruga!"" I answered the same and he was going away. And for this conversation I had to open my tent, that everything got wet! After a while the same game with another person. But then they let me alone. The next morning I was awakened buy one of the guys at 7am and he showed with hand signs that I should not stay there. He showed in a direction where maybe a hotel was. But now I didnt need any hotel anymore, so I left the tea plantage.

I was going to the Periyar Sanctuaryat the border to Tamil Nadu. First I missed it and I was riding down with much speed to about 400 m altitude. There I was said I am already in Tamil Nadu and I have to go back. Again upwards, maybe 400m. 10 min. down, 1h up...I was a bit disappointed because I couldnt go into the park with my bike. The normal way is to take a boat trip or to take
DSCF3199
no...
a tour guide which you had to book in advance. The second alternative sounded better, but another day staying there I wasnt going for that. So I took the touristical boat trip. And as I thought it was quite boring. Of course, the animals are running away by such a noisy boat going along the lake. When the staff said: ""Look, a deer!"" Everybody was getting to his feet and making pictures. But from a big distance we could see two elephants and wild pigs and a buffalo. Next to the boat we have seen two otters. An Indian tourist group m,ade much fotos of me and my bike. Maybe I was the most interesting being they have seen in the park 😊

Tamil Nadu I liked much more than Kerala, not so crowded and you easily find sleeping places 😊 In restaurants the food is served on palm leaves, very cool! In the days I arrived here there is a festival, especially celebrated in the countryside. As far as I have understood are the cows celebrated. They are often coloured, their fur and their horns. And in the villages there comes from big loudspeakers loud music, with a
DSCF3200
no...
very bad quality. I often was awakened by this music.



My two tent bars are broken now. Now the tent is a bit unstable there is little space inside and it is not drying so easy. But it still works. Hopefully I can get it fixed in Chennai!

One day I was staying at a lake. One guy asked me where I want to go now and I said I want to look for sleeping place. He was discussing something with another guy. I said:""For example here!"" Because I liked this place and was annoyed of their disussion. They found it quite funny I think that I want to stay there and said:""I like this place!"" They said something about cold, mosquitos, snakes, but no reasons not to stay there with my tent. They phoned to some friends and aftyer a few minutes the half village was watching me pitching my tent up. Every newcomer was greeted with the words:""...I like this place!..."" accompanied with some laughter. Didnt know that this sentence was so funny... The next morning when I got up a guy saw me and he whistled to the village that everybody could join
DSCF3201
no...
the morning show of the strange crazy foreigner that likes that place.

I went to Puducherry in a bar restaurant. It was noon, but it was very full and loud and all people drinking. I had two beers and a little snack there. I was a bit drunk. I think I am not used to drink anymore. In the near I was also in the sea, seemed to be a famous beach by the locals. But it was funny that they just stood around. Not like at us, where everybody is lying at a towel or so. Only few were in the water, mostly little children. However, that didnt keep me from having a nice refreshing bath.

From Puducherry I followed the coast to Chennai. I had a little misunderstanding with Sepp, I thought he will arrive at Friday night in Chennai, but it was on Sunday night. So I had suddenly 2 more days where I was quite lazy, was often in an internetcafe and wrote some diary.
