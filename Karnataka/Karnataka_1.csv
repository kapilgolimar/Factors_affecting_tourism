After an evenings practise, we felt we were fully prepared for our sold out performance to what seemed like half of Tirunelveli. It was surreal turning up and being cheered walking through a sea of 7000 school girls, eager to hear our number. We were treated to a performance of their own, at which point the nerves kicked in. After a quick welcoming from the headmistress, we hit the stage and belted out possibly the worst version of 'Oh Happy Day' you will ever not hear - unless you come to our celebration evening and watch the recording! This was followed by an equally painful version of 'Wonderwall'. The students loved it, despite not having a clue what we were singing about!



We then went on a tour of the school where we answered questions the students had and signed autographs (we are really celebrities now!) We exchanged questions and answers and were shocked to find out that there was a class of 170 students! Mr Butterworth would have a heart attack! We then spent the remainder of the afternoon chilling out, recovering from the experience and signing more autographs when getting stopped for them in the street! Another amazing day.

<p>After 4 days of hard grind, a day of rest and recuperation was gratefully received.</p><p>The early morning crew went out for their 6am run. Even at this time the temperture must be 70-80 degrees.</p><p>After breakfast, we all went on a tour of a local temple. None of us were really prepared for the size and majesty of this holy building. We wandered around it for 45 minutes and were all moved and impressed by the scale, craftmanship and reverence in which the indigenous people held it. A great visit was topped off by a meeting with an elephant. For a few ruppees donation he would bless an individual by taking their note in his trunkand then resting it on their head. Unfortunately for Jake he sneezed at him instead.</p><p>After the temple, the group had a chance to do some shopping. A number of the group purchased saris. Quite a few of the males in the group, bought lightweight Indian cotton suits, which they later wore to dinner much to the chef's delight. As the only westerners in sight, we continued to be looked at with a mixture of curiosity, delight and friendliness.</p><p>One of the best bits about the trip so far has been how the students have really taken the initiative in making the most of the experience. A group of the lads had organised a cricket training session for some of the deaf students earlier in the week. Today they organised another 2 hour session in their free-time, which again was a great success. Other students have organised football games against the locals or have taken it upon themselves to offer their help in teaching lessons, such as art. Some have taken it upon themselves to start their working day earlier, beginning at 8am rather than at 10am.</p><p>The feedback from the Principal of the school and from our host has been hugely positive and they've been blown away by how much the students have achieved in such a short amount of time. Praise indeed.</p><p>Tomorrow, we will be visiting a local girls school. 7,000 students attend - over 4 times that of Overton. Pretty daunting in itself. Even more nerve-racking is the fact that we will be attending their whole-school assembly and have been invited to sing a song as part of the assembly. Tonight has been desperately spent learning the words to 'O Happy Day' and fine-tuning our performance. Fingers crossed...</p>

Friday - One half of the group continued working on building a kitchen area for a local school. The local press got wind of our endeavours and sent a photographer down to the school to see what was occuring. Celebrity status ensued and a few of the group let their newfound fame go to their heads by trying to hog the camera. The party's divas have now been identified and will be outed at the celebration dinner back in Sutton (14th Sept). Work went really well and the kitchen went from little more than two feet tall to a whopping six feet.

The second group continued to renovate one of the building at Chittenden Deaf School, where we are staying. This meant a great deal of physically demanding jobs, such as smashing plaster of walls, scraping paint off the structure and sanding it down. One thing in particular put the trip in perspective. On the first floor balcony is a bed and a small locked chest. It's pretty much the life's possessions of one of the deaf wardens who works at the school. He was an orphan from birth and was taken in by the school. He has lived there for over 50 years and lives on a metal bed (no matress) with a pillow and a few items locked away in a small chest. It really did help to hit home how lucky we all are.

Both groups worked tirelessly and had some downtime in the late afternoon to head into town to buy some local delicacies - Pringles, Coke and Dairy Milk. One more Project day and then we get a day's break on Sunday.

So far we have had a brilliant time. All the youngpeople have now experienced working in a bakery and we are now completing two building projects. These consist of, a kitchen and toilet at a local primary school in a near by village and a warden accommodation at the deaf school.



It is very different here, and we feel like we should be on the 'Only way is India' as we have acquired celebrity status for no reason! The food is amazing and everyone has been adventerous at trying everything. We are well looked after in the school we are staying at, and everyone is very appreciative of the work we are doing. The boys have been busy setting up lots of cricket and football tournaments. Although they are one nil down after losing against 400 Indian students!



We have now all ventured into the local town and have experienced how manic it is! The internet cafe only has five computers so if you haven't heard from your son/daughter yet it will be that they haven't had a chance to get in there yet, or they have been too busy having a fabulous time, many of them saying the internet can wait until they get home! Yes really!



We are now off to have a sign language lesson, followed by dinner and then practise for our performance on Sunday to 7000 students! We will update again when we can, and hopefully add some pictures if we work out how to on these computers!

Hi,



Sorry for the delay in updating - this is the first chance we have had to get on the internet. We have all arrived safely after a long journey. The train ride was amazing and we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We have been very busy visiting the school, playing games with the students etc. We have started on the project today, whilst a group worked in the bakery. Everything is fine, and everyone is well. We will hopefully be able to update more regularly from now on.

What is it with ‘non-veg’ restaurants and sleazy rowdy men? Why is it that if an un-escorted girl enters a ‘non-veg’ restaurant post 6pm, then SHE is what’s being served! At least in India.

Well appetites apart, Coimbatore Railway Station has a variety of lodges and accommodation for nearly every type of traveler. I, being one of the lesser value ones, chose a single-occupancy (very fancy word for a not-so-fancy place) room at Raja Lodge, just behind KR Restaurant (a landmark here), for Rs 300/- per night. If I must rate it then I’d give it a 1.5 on 10.

Actually, it depends, if you’re an Indian sportsman then it’s a 6.5, but if not then it’s 1.5. I think every Indian sportsman has stayed in conditions far far worse and even appreciated some of those. We’ve traveled for competitions unreserved in foul smelling general compartments, slept on baggage instead of beds, and bathed in bathrooms with taps for showers and curtains for doors (with holes in them too). So this place is really not that bad…in comparison.

But what was great, even for non-Indian non-sportsmen, was where I stayed in Ooty. Montauban Guest House – once the residence of a French designer called Ettines (after whom the road that the guest house is on is called Ettines Road) who lived in Ooty in the 1920s (Sorry, but that’s about all the history I can deal with for one place) – is my favourite place to stay. After staying there for 6 nights (I could have stayed there for 6 months) at Rs 650/- per night, I have decided to dedicate a few good words to the place.

Its manicured gardens and lawns gives it, and therefore you, a very cared-for air. And although you won’t find on-call butler-suave room-service, if, with kindness, you approach them for any task, it will be diligently and efficiently done ASAP. The rooms are cozy and non-musty smelling – not a spec of dust to be found. They come with proper beds (clean blankets and all), drinking water, tissue, soap, a writing table (with a chair and that’s worth a mention in this country) and a sideboard with plenty of drawers. I love drawers, you never know what you find in them. Oh, and the bathroom is huge and spacious, and tiled, and clean, and western style – with a working flush!!!

I have, now reached the fag end of my tapioca journey, and my jeans have turned from blue to brown. But if you do happen to book a room in one of these lodges opposite the Coimbatore railway station, always try for the top-most floors. You get less peeping-toms, that way.

Dinner was at KR Restaurant, where a sign hiding behind a couple of bicycles reads “Please safe your own vehicles yourself”, and where you will frequently find customers wiping their freshly washed hands and mouth on the curtain that separates the washroom from the restaurant, and where ‘calli flower masala dosas’ are on the menu, and where, if you’re as lucky as I was, you might get to witness your waiter scratching his private parts while he waits to take your order.

If I may say so, it was almost as if he was trying to pick out something rather troublesome quite deeply buried in there. I’m not sure if he was quite so successful, though.

And, if all that hasn’t tempted you enough to step right in, then I’ll also add, that the food wasn’t bad. Do not try the Chinese. It is, and I’m not saying this sarcastically, the best restaurant on that block. 3 on 10.

But during my 6 days in Ooty, I ate at very few restaurants – I’m not as adventurous with food as I am with accommodation, I’m afraid. One which I consistently ate at is Kurunjis – a tiny outdoor restaurant on the main road about 100 meters from Charing Cross Junction – serves clean, yum, cheap and hygienic food, with very courteous waiters. 10 on 10. Another nice place (I have heard) is Shinkows (Chinese).

In Conoor, where my Tapioca friends were staying in their cozy and comfy homestay, I ate at a Chinese restaurant called Dragon something. For one thing the waiter was a young Mongloid-featured lad with a very funky hairdo. That was enough to pull me in. Mongloid men with funky hairdos are one of my all-time favourite dishes. And although he wasn’t on the menu, the food we did order, was quite good; better than the supposedly French restaurant called La Belle Vie where the waiter actually apologized for bringing the dish late because he’d “dropped it” on the way. That’s 3.5 on 10 for the Belle and 6.5 for the Dragon. We topped that with ice cream and hot chocolate from the café coffee day next door and that was excellent 8.5 for CCD.

So, two crisp Rava Roast Dosas, one itchy waiter, one filthy curtain and a safety sign later (of course minus the calli flower dosa) I walked back to my little concrete cave and called it a night.

In the morning I caught my train back to Bombay which started its journey 2 hours behind schedule and changed two engines en-route making us a total of 6 hours late by the time we got into Bombay. Welcome to India.

Inaugaration
The Meatless Travelers
The first day of the Ricksaw Run....

Festivities started off at 10:00 AM with a parade of rickshaws around Fort Cochin. A few speeches, including the Chancellor of Cochin, later was the official inaugaration and we were off by 11:00AM!

After an hour of navigating around Cochin city traffic, we finally hit the Highway. Inspite of today being Easter Sunday some spots still had significant bus and truck traffic. Outside of the inevitable damage we are constantly inundating our clutch with, we are trying to ensure our Rickshaw is getting the TLC it deserves with regular stops, ""petrol/oil breaks"" and checking of air pressure. We definitely underestimated the curiosity and excitement of the Indian population when seeing us drive around in a rickshaw, with some cars driving alongside just to get a better look

Tomorrow we set out early for Bangalore, with the goal of reaching there before 6:00 PM

Sorry for this late backup, but here it is!

My friend Sepp arrived in the early morning on my birthday, 23.1., in Chennai. Outside the airport it is (like everywhere) extremely loud due to the much traffic that wants to go to or away from the airport. For people that dont want to flight it was forbidden to get into the airport or you have to pay a visitor ticket. Of course, I didnt buy such a ticket, so I had to wait outside. I had the feeling that Sepp was the last passenger who came out. Immediately a taxi driver came to us. We said we want to have a prepaid taxi. He said, yes, of course he is a prepaid taxi driver, 450Rupees. Very funny. If he were a driving a prepaid taxi, he would not have to look for the passengers and besides that I had found out before that it costs only 300 something. So we went to the pre paid taxi stand. The taxi driver joined us. It is very interesting to see that in India they all work together if it is about getting some money from tourists. The guy at the taxi stand
Photo 63
laughed at me as I said that it costs only 300 something, and he said we have to go with the driver and pay 450. Since it was in the middle of the night we didnt want to discuss and we went with the taxi. We had to pay after the ride. I think thats why it is called ""prepaid"" 😊 Sepp was quite afraid when he saw how the taxi driver was driving. Although there was almost nothing on the streets. I said he has to wait until the morning... The driver even didn't know the exact address of our hotel, but I recognized the area and said that we will find the hotel on our own. A Riksha-Driver said he will take us to the hotel for 20 Rupees. Since Sepp didnt want to walk in the middle of the night we agreed. But the Riksha driver had no idea where the hotel was either. However, we arrived finally at our hotel.

The next day many Rikshaw drivers were annoying us. Normally I am always on my bike, so that they don't get the idea to ask me if I need a ride. But here every driver
BILD1804
the family who wanted that we bring their story to the public
asked us and some even followed us for half an hour. When we wanted to ask someone for the way, we had to be careful that no riksha driver was seeing that because else they immediately offered their riksha:""Get in! I will bring you there!"" One riksha man was offering us to bring us to the beach for 10 Rupees. We agreed. He started to show us some temples and so. We said we just want to go to the beach. He said with a few Rupees extra he will do a city tour withe us. No, thank you. When we come to some shops our ride will be free. No, thank you. Just to the beach. That will be 50 Rupees. No, you said 10 Rupees. Nono, 10 Dollars. Thats bullshit. No ride in the city costs 10 Dollars. He said, no ride in the city costs 10 Rupees. So I wanted to get out, but Sepp still wanted to argue. After a while we got out and paid the 10 Rupees. The driver shouted after us: ""Crazy tourists!""And we said ""crazy Indian"". We had no idea where we were, but after a while we found the beach. We
BILD1805
heard that Chennai has the world's largest beach. To have a bath there is not recommended because many litter is put into the sea. We were happy that not only we but also Indian tourists were asked to buy some kitsch or to pay for a picture on a horse. We went to a bike shop area and looked for a bicycle for Sepp. They all had a standard single speed bike but could put some gears on it. Sepp chose a bike with six gears. We were said to take the bike the next afternoon. In the evening we celebrated the arrival of Sepp and my birthday in a bar.

The next day I tried to get new bars for my tent. But most people that we asked even didnt know what a tent is. Although we tried several shops and areas where the people,that did know what a tent was, sent us, we didnt find any tent or even tent bars. I was a bit surprised, that such a huge town (Chennai is the fourth biggest town in India) has no outdoor shops. That was in Teheran a bit different...

We met a homeless family. They
BILD1806
there were their old houses
wanted that we make fotos of them and the poor area. The man was trying to tell us something on Tamil which we couldnt understand. He couldnt speak English. As he recognized that I know some Hindi words he called excitedly his wife who was able to speak Hindi. But my Hindi was not good enough to understand her. He invited us for a tea. Actually we wanted to pay it but he was faster. He led us a whikle around the area and wanted that we make some pictures. After a while he found some youth who translated what he had tried to explain us.Their houses were broken down by the government with no chargeback. He wanted from us that we bring his story to the newspapers. We said that we are just tourists and no reporters. But I promised to make a note in my blog about this. He was very disappointed about that and was going away immediately. We felt very pity with him but we didnt know how to help him.

We were in the cycle shop to get Sepps bike. We were told that the guy who had to build the bike hasnt arrived
Photo 64
this day to work. Ahhh, okay???? One could think that they are not interested in our money. I would have gone to the next shop I think, but Sepp gave them a next chance and we wanted to take it tomorrow noon.No problem! (Of course not, how could we think that it could be a problem?)

In the evening we were in a dance performance.We weren't too excited so we went out in the pause again. There we met a funny old guy. Who said that we have to come tomorrow again, there will be a great singer. We went together to a restaurant. Two women also joined us, the guy was not very lucky with that. He said to me women always make only trouble. The one woman said all the time that she needs some money for the marriage of her daughter. We have heard before that there is still the problem in India that some families are still forced to ruin theirselves for the marriage of their daughter. Although it is already forbidden by law. The guy was ashamed of her and of the situation and wrote on a paper for me, that he has not
BILD1808
we met many people that liked Hitler and the Nazis
enough money for us all. I answered that it is no problem and that we can pay the bill.

The next day we were again at the bike shop. The bike was still not ready they couldnt get the gears on it. Sepp still wanted to stay at that shop and looked for a ready bike that costed much more. He finally bought a bike that was much more expensive than the original one but compared to Germany still really cheap, of course. They had no panniers there, so Sepp had to put his big backpack on the carrier.

We rode out of the city. Respect to Sepp who managed to ride through the mega city with a new bike much luggage, crazy traffic and left traffic. In the evening we stayed in a hotel called farm house which we thought would be quite cheap. No, it was not cheap, it was quite luxury. We said its too expensive but we asked if we can build up our tents there.They offerd us a room for 700R instead of 2800R so we took the room. In the hotel in Chennai I traded my Rough Guide to the new edition
Photo 65
local hooligans
which also was much thinner. I was happy about this, but in the evening I saw, why it was so thin: the pages of much chapters were pulled out.

We went to Mamallapuram where some historical buildings are. There were also many Indian tourists and they all wanted to make pictures from us.

We continued to Pondicherry which wis a french colony. The streets there are often still named in French. Pondicherry seemed to be a bit richer and cleaner as the cities that we have seen before. We stayed along the coast till Nagapattinam and had some nice baths in the Bay of Bengal. One night where we made rough camping a few youths said to us that there it is dangerous because of wild animals. We decided nevertheless to stay there. One guy was joining usand drank some brandy with us. But with the time he was getting more and more excited that it is so dangerous where we are. He was getting louder and started to ennoy us really. He could not really explain what the problem was and said something like: ""Dang-aaa!In-aaaa!Out-aaaa!Tent-aaaa!"" We didnt know how to get rid of them and went into
Photo 66
dance performance in Chennai
the tent. He went away but came a few minutes back.We shooed him away. But after a while he came back and was trying my helmet and twiddled with my bike. I was getting very angry and then he ran panically away. Maybe he just was drunken.

The next day Sepp was in a very bad mood. In his tent it was really wet and cold. He had stomach cramps and diarrhoea and could not sleep. I think the two flat tyres and the 4 kids watching him in the good morning show hasn't raised his mood I think...

We went from the Eastern coast to the Ghats in Western Tamil Nadu. On the way we visited some temples. Always the question: ""May I have a photo, please?"" What we think is quite crazy, is, that many people also want that we make a picture of them. We dont knw them, they dont know us, they wont get the pictures somewhen, but they like it to be photographed. In Trichy (actually Tiruchchirappalli, but since the English colonists couldnt pronounce it, it is just called Trichy) we saw a big nass of pilgrims coming to a little temple.They arrived
Photo 67
with drums and other music and with idols. They smashed coconuts in a container.We learned that from that day on starts a month for a special god of this temple. They start to pilgrimage from here and everywhere in South India to a town called Palani. The next days we have seen thousands of them. There are three main days where they arrive there.

We were often in restaurants. It is so tasty and cheap and there are so many restaurants, that it doesn't make sense to make your own food. There are sometimes so many staffs for so little guests that 5 staffs are standing around our table and give us new water or rice or anything thats going to finish. A meal costs often less than an Euro, so you cant imagine that so many people can live of that. On the other hand they are often confused if you order after the main course something else. They often bring the bill before we have finished and they have to change the bill a few times. As if they want to get rid of us and don't want our money. Others are smarter and recognize that we
Photo 68
eat a lot and offer us after the second portion much other stuff that we have to try. In total we are quite happy that we ride every day, so that we dont have to matter about the amount we eat.

Often when people see us building up our tents (actually, I had no place in India, where at least a few people saw me in the evening or in the morning camping), they warn us or say we cant stay there. They often cant explain why and the most time we insist on staying there and they go away. Maybe they just cannot understand that we rich tourists stay voluntarily at a uncomfortable place.

There are often lakes where the people wash theirselves. One night we were at such a lake and had a nice washing session. Two locals came there and said we cant wash there. They couldnt explain why and we thought now it is too late, we are already ready. The next morning I was there again. In the night I had diarrhoea and I was too slow so that some stuff got on my undertrousers. I wanted to wash me and my clothes
Photo 69
when we are agreed about the direction we can start:)
again in the lake and this time two locals warned me before I was getting in.This place was used as toilet place...Maybe this time it would be the right place for me 😊 but I went to the real washing place they showed me.

Sepp was often moaning that he is exhausted and cant anymore and needs some rest, but was the most time faster than me, especially when it was going upwards. We went to Kodaikanal in the Ghats. It was 2 days very steep upwards. The first day we asked for a hotel. ""In 4 km"". Okay, thats doable. After 5km there was a little village. We asked again. ""Just 5 km upwards."" We were not going for another 5km, so we asked if its not possible to sleep somewhere here. We could sleep behind a school. We thought that we won't be alone there for a long time. But we were not disturbed that night and the morning. We were told that the school starts at 8am, but at 8am nobody was there, so they probably just told us so to that we vanish in time. The landscape around Kodaikanal was amazing. But it also was
Photo 70
quite cold, we had to wear long clothes. In Kodaikanal there was very often power breakdown. In our hotel we had not hot water either, except from 7.30am-8am when we extra were awaked to fill the water in containers. Sepp was very cold in the night, for me it was okay, I had a warm sleeping back... We were offered a better room with electricity and hot water the whole day for 300R extra. We said we dont need the better room, but the next two days Sepp was a bit annoyed especially about not having warmth. We wondered what the locals are doing here in the evening or night. It is getting dark at about 6pm. We found one bar that also closes at 9 or so. One evening we saw a procession with loud music. we learned that there was celebrated the day of St. Thomas. Thats probably what they do. There are so many festivals and processions that you can make party nearly every time 😊 Downhill it was not so great fun as expected! The streets were very bad so that we had to ride very cautious. Due to a big road hole I got a
Photo 71
puncture. There were many monkeys who where quite aggressive. One monkey was offending and hitting me to get some cornflakes that I had in my hands.

We went to Palani where at this time millions of pilgrims come to a special temple. We were in the temple one day after the three main days but it was still very crowded. All the people wanted again that we make pictures of them. The next days we still saw on the roads thousands of pilgrims going to that place. They all are barefoot. The next day we saw a big river were many pilgrims were washing. It was amazing to see the coloured people and clothes in the water. Of course, we also had a bath there!

One evening we were in a bar were a guy joined us. He could not speak a full sentence in English and tried to talk to us in Tamil all the time. We spent him some beer. He was ordering some new drinks for us and wanted also to drink of it. We were a bit annoyed about him and we said to the staff, that he can sit next to us and
Photo 72
drink his beer, but he has to pay his own beer, that we want no common bill but an extra bill for him and for us. The bar man could nearly no English, too, just understood ""bill"" and brought us the bill. We hadn't the intention to pay at that moment and ordered more. After every order they brought us the updated bill. Quite funny!

There is a very tiny train going to another hill station in the ghats, Ooty (actually Udagamandalam, but as many other cities, there is a short form that everybody can pronounce 😊). This train seems to be just for tourists, also many Indian tourists. Although the train was starting very early in the morning, there was a party atmosphere, especially in the neighbour cabin. We didnt stay in Ooty because it is said to be similar to Kodaikanal and we had not so much time anymore. So we rode downhill on the same day. I think it was the steepest descent I ever had. We had to break all the time. That was not so fun.

We went to the Mudumalai National Park. When we arrived there we were first told that it
Photo 73
geckos everywhere
is not allowed to go there with two wheelers. But then we also could get inside and saw also many mopeds in the park. At dusk we made a private jeep tour and the next morning a official bus tour. Then we rode outside again and we realised that that is the best way to go through the park. You dont disturb the animal with your noisy vehicle and can see more animals.

After the park we wanted to go to the neighbour state Kerala. We decided to do a night ride. At dusk we saw a bar and we thought that we can drink a beer first. There were two rooms, one without A/C and one with. The first room seemed to be more fun, there were many people laughing and having fun. The second one was quite boring, it was cold and dark and nobody there. So we wanted to go to the romm without A/C but we couldnt sit down there. We were immediately led to the second room. But after a while it was also quite funny. We made much pictures and discussed nonsense. Some people could speak better Hindi than English so I tried
Photo 74
some Hindi again. From the one beer it became a few and some brandies or whiskys... The bar was closing at 9pm so we still could do our night trip. Sepp had no light but thats normal in India, I have never seen a bike (except mine) with light. The back light even some mopeds or trucks dont have. That night we slept for a few hours under palm trees without our tents.

Our last aim was Calicut at the West coast, the Arabian Sea. We have heard of a resort where you can make boat trips on the backwaters. As we arrived there Sepp could see my face expressing panic because it was very luxurious and seemed to be very expensive. We nevertheless entered. We should sit down on very luxurious seats at the reception. We had some compunctions to sit there because we were so dirty and did not seem to fit to this place. As the reception told us the prices for the boat trips our assumptions were confirmed. It was too expensive for us. But we arranged a date for a Ayurvedic massage for the next day which was really great! After the massage we
Photo 75
decided to go to a cinema. But that was not so easy. We were send from one cinema to the next and they all were closed at that time. Finally we found a cinema with the movie ""Spanish Masala"" in Malayalam. It was quite nice although we havent understood much of the dialogues, of course. We were surprised about the huge, comfortable and very modern cinema. Maybe the best cinema we have seen yet. But the sound was too loud for us. In the middle of that night it was knocking at our door of our hotel room. We first thought that we watched TV too loud, but that was just a staff who started to paint me when we read some newspaper at the reception of the hotel and wanted to finish it.

The last day in Calicut we made a short cycle trip to the nice Kappad beach, where I already have been alone. (Where I first was warned from locals of snakes and was shown another, safe place, and later the police awaked me in the middle of the night to say me that that place is not safe because of thieves)We were lying there in

the sun, so that our stomaches also got a sunburn😊 The water was so warm, that it was not very refreshing to swim there.

We took the train back to Chennai. We had to put our cycles to the parcel office. They couldnt promise that the bikes come with our train to Chennai. We didnt feel very comfortable with this statement! The train was driving the whole night from 8pm to 8am. We had a nice sleeper wagon. We havent thought of a blanket or so and was getting cold in the night. So I could not sleep very well there. Sepp said he could sleep very good. We thought we were already champions with parcel in trains because we aölso had to put our bikes to parcel with the train to Ooty. But we had to learn that Chennai is a bit bigger than Ooty. We had to go from office to office and nobody could tell us were our bikes are. After a while we were told that we have to come back later and see if they are there then. They only arrived at 3pm but they arrived! It took some time to get a hotel,
Photo 77
all hotels are full. This phenomen we also had in the other towns. In germany the hotels would be very lucky if they had so much guests all the time! The room we got was very bad and expensive. One woman was brushing the dust from one corner to the next and wanted to have some tip for that. Even after that, everytime she saw us she was begging. And that in her hotel. I havent seen that before.

While I was taking some money from an ATM, Sepp found a person who was interested to buy his bike. He paid 9000R and the guy wants to pay him 4000R if he gives him the bill. In the evening there was also another interested guy that had paid him 2500R immediately. But he refused. He couldnt find the bill again and the next evening he only got 2000R from the first guy. Better than nothing! He was happy to get rid of it. The last day Sepp was a bit ill. He had to vomit into a dustbin. Nobody noted that. Seems to be quite normal there. We were in a little park with zoo in Chennai and went

early to bed. And again I could leave him much stuff to reduce my luggage. Sepps flight back to Germany was in the morning of the 18.2.

It was a really great time! Thank you so much for your visit!

Tur til pondicherri som ligger ca. 150 km syd for Chennai.

Min første weekend i Indien afsted med et par kollegaer.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pondicherry

Lørdag:

Afslapning ved rooftoppool og generel dovenskab, om aftenen på byens hotteste natklub som lukker kl 22.30.
Denne del af Indien er MEGET konservativt...

Søndag:

Sove længe og se lidt af byen.

Blev velsignet af en elefant😊

En mand stjal vores sko i håb om at få penge for at have passet på dem, han endte dog ikke med at få en Rupie.

Til sidst en tur til Auroville som er et lille samfund, som de fleste nok ville kalde en sekt, startet af både vesterlændinge og indere.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auroville



Alt i alt en god weekend at starte Indien-eventyret på😊

We started on 31st March 2012 toward Kanyakumari from Bangalore at around 4 PM in the evening. It took around 1 hour to dodge the traffic and get out of the city. But we all were excited for this long trip. I forgot to tell you guys that the entire trip was a road trip so lots of driving involved 😊 (Best way to travel in India). Our first stop was near Krishnagiri On a Fuel station. We had our dinner in McDonald’s. Just make sure fill your self here because you wont get anything good after that. We stopped to refuel in couple of places. Complete road is a 4 Way higway NH7 so you can speed upto 120-160KMPH but be careful of coming wrong side traffic. We reached Kanyakumari before the sunrise, but got very disappointed by the crowd and the clouds. It is not worth staying in kanyakumari. So we head toward Kovalam, Kerala after freshen up in a restaurant.

Billede af flyveren der fløj mig fra København til Dubai
Denne handler kort om min udrejse til Chennai, lejligheden jeg bor i og mine første indtryk fra det mærkelige land Indien...

Udrejse:

Afsted kl 14.00 fra Kbh, via Dubai (kort mellemlanding 3 timer) til Chennai Indien.

Fik ingen søvn under turen, så var godt smadret da jeg landede kl 8.10 lokal tid (3.40 Dansk tid).

Noget af et kulturchok, gammel smadret lufthavn mennesker overalt og lugt, varme og larm. Blev heldigvis hentet af en kollega og vores chauffør Manu.

Køreturen fra lufthavnen til kontoret hvor jeg lige var inde og sige hej, var også noget af en oplevelse, de kører som død og helvede og man bruger hele tiden horn og lygter. Har faktisk skræmmende nok stort set vænnet mig til det nu..



Lejligheden:

Lejligheden er lækker, traditionen tro er der vagter over det hele, selv om de vist nok sover det meste af tiden. Selvom det er et utroligt lækkert kompleks jeg bor i, er en af vores naboer et lille slumkvarter, sådan er det vist bare i Indien😊

Deler lejligheden med en kollega (fra en anden afdeling), han er oprindeligt franskmand men snakker dansk, og jeg tror nok vi
P3200165
Fra dubai Lufthavn
skal komme til at få det hyggeligt.



Diverse indtryk:

Mænd der går hånd i hånd eller nusser hinanden er i Indien gode venner og ikke homoseksuelle, det er noget grænseoverskridende, men åbenbart ganske normalt.

Mange indere bruger ikke toilet-papir, men ""spuler sig"", så hvis der vådt på gulvet når du kommer ind på et toilet er det let at gætte hvorfor.

Arbejdslønnen for lavtlønsjob er noget der minder om 40 kr om dagen (28 dage om ugen, 10-12 timer om dagen).
Da det er så billigt er der folk til ALT, f.eks. har vi på kontoret (hvor der er tre printere) en gut der tager printene ud af printeren og giver dem til en, meget stenet😊
En autorickshaw (tre hjulet knallert taxi), koster ca. 1-2 kroner at køre i per kilometer (alt inklusiv).

Min dag på et offentligt kontor for at få en ""residential permit"".

Forestil jer et kontor med to skranker i to seperate (meget varme) rum, en 50-100 ansøgere og nogle ansatte der har fået skrankepave nykker.
Man starter med at sidde i kø, så bliver man efter en times tid sendt til skranke 1, de kigger lidt på bunken
P3200166
Fra Dubai Lufthavn
af papirer man har med, bladrer lidt tilfældigt i dem og skriver lidt noter. Så bliver man sendt ind i det andet rum til skranke 2, uden egentlig at vide hvad man skal foretage sig der. Efter man ved at spørge sig lidt for hvad man egentlig skal her og lidt køsidning ender man ved en skranke hvor personen gør det samme som personen i det første kontor. Så bliver man sendt tilbage til det første kontor hvor historien gentager sig. Efter en 3-4 gange frem og tilbage mellem de forskellige kontorer og skranker, og vel at mærke samme personer, (2-3 timer senere) får man en kvittering hvor der står at man kan hente det en anden dag.
Her var jeg så fræk nok til at spørge om jeg ikke kunne få den samme dag, da jeg skulle bruge den til at hente nogle ting jeg har fået sendt med luftfragt. Efter en lang diskussiuon aftaler vi (meget mod skrankepavens vilje) at jeg kan komme tilbage 2 timer senere, kl 16.00, for at hente den. Da jeg kommer tilbage kan jeg godt se at det kommer til at tage tid da jeg har pisset på hendes sukkermad. Jeg ender med

at få den ca. 18.30, hvor jeg er den ENESTE person tilbage i venteværelset og de lige har provokeret mig lidt med at sidde og hyggesnakke og tage billeder af hinanden. Men jeg behøver i det mindste ikke at komme tilbage og skulle igennem det cirkus en gang til, så jeg kalder det en succes😊

Ooty
Elles cueillent le the a la main ou avec une serpe comme celle du druide Panoramix.
24 mars 2012, Ooty

En arrivant à Ooty, comme la ville n’a de charmant que son nom, nous nous sommes mis à la recherche d’un hôtel un peu excentré pour profiter du calme et de la fraîcheur des montagnes. Nous cherchions en compagnie d’un Allemand que nous avions rencontré dans le bus. Nous avions trouvé un hôtel génial, soit un YWCA installé dans un vieux bâtiment religieux en pierre et en bois, avec des salons meublés style 1940, un parc, un jardin et une chapelle. On avait même une bible dans notre chambre! Le charme fût brisé quand on nous a annoncé qu’une seule chambre à un prix vraiment raisonnable était libre, ainsi qu’une deuxième de luxe qui ne valait pas son prix exorbitant. On a pensé la prendre une nuit et changer le lendemain matin pour une plus raisonnable, mais le maître d’hôtel nous a dit qu’elles étaient toutes prises pour minimum deux nuits. Comme l’Allemand voyageait seul, on ne lui a laissé la chambre raisonnable et on a continué notre recherche à pieds, avec nos gros sacs sur le dos, affamés, fatigués et bougons. L’heure suivante n’a été que déception. On est donc revenus au super hôtel en
Ooty
Ecoliers
demandant un lit dans le dortoir, qui coûtait des peanuts. Miraculeusement, une chambre à prix raisonnable était à ce moment libre, et pour autant de nuits qu’on voulait! La morale de l’histoire : demander toujours le plus cheap pour vous faire offrir le raisonnable!

Donc, comme la ville de Ooty n’est pas vraiment charmante et que les parcs nationaux sont actuellement fermés au trekking, on s’est informé pour un tour campagnard. Pour la modique somme de 10$, une ballade de 3 km dans les plantations de thé et la visite d’un village en compagnie de 15 autres touristes nous était offerte. Ce n’est pas si cher, mais l’option gros-groupe-à-la-queue-leuleu ne nous tentait guère. Donc pour 0,25$, on s’est improvisé notre propre tour d’une dizaine de kilomètres traversant 6 villages, des boisés et des plantations de thé!

Accompagnés du même Allemand et de 3 autres Israéliens tous très sympathiques, on a pris un autobus qui nous a laissé à la croisé de la route principale et d’un petit chemin de campagne. On avait avec nous une carte où étaient identifiés les villages et non les routes. Mais ce n’était pas un problème puisque que les nombreux villageois que nous
Ooty
L'heure du the chez un paysans. Devinez ou sont les femmes ?!
croisions nous indiquaient le bon chemin à suivre, et même des raccourcis à travers les plantations de thé! Tout le monde que nous croisions nous saluaient, nous souriaient, voulaient nous aider, nous parler. L’un deux nous a même invité à prendre le thé chez lui! Tout compte fait, je dirais que nos rencontres avec les villageois étaient encore plus belles que les paysages! Il en est toujours ainsi quand on sort des sentiers battus et du carcan touristique. Ce n’est finalement pas si compliqué et tellement plus enrichissant comme expérience!

Pour le retour, on a rejoint la route principale pour embarquer dans le premier autobus qui passait en direction de Ooty. Arrivés en ville, on est allé tout le groupe ensemble boire une bière avant le souper, chose qui ne fût pas facile! En fait, à Ooty, ils n’en vendent pas dans les restaurants, il faut aller dans un bar… si on peut appeler un bar! My god, c’est l’endroit le plus miteux où je suis allée de toute ma vie! Il faut d’abord acheter ce qu’on veut boire au rez-de-chaussée à un gars qui se trouve derrière une grille. On a demandé two cold beers, il nous a
Ooty
Merci mme pour votre the, votre mari nous l'a bien servi. Et surtout merci pour votre beau sourire!
donné deux bières tablettes en nous disant que c’est natural cold… Il n’est peut-être pas sexy le barman, mais pas mal futé! Et pour ceux qui veulent un drink, tu dois acheter le kit au complet et faire toi-même ton mix, que tu emportes avec toi si jamais tu quittes sans l’avoir fini. Ensuite, on monte au deuxième où il n’y a que des tables en bois avec des petits tabourets en plastiques, que des hommes, et que des indiens. Pas de musique, pas de billard ni de babyfoot, pas de pop-corn. Juste de la boucane!

En compagnie de Stephen et de Lis (nous croyons que ce couple Allemand-Israélien a débuté à Ooty), on a quitté Ooty pour Munnar, Ô combien plus joli !!! La route a été très longue mais en valait définitivement la peine. En 11 heures, on a pris 4 autobus locaux pour faire le trajet tortueux. Le dernier tronçon était tout simplement magnifique, tout comme notre ballade d’aujourd’hui. Je n’ai jamais rien de vu de tel!

Je garde le meilleur pour la prochaine chronique... Bye!

Ilana – c’est mon nom en Hebreu, qui signifie arbre. Hey ben!

Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary
'Yes, you can go to Vedanthangal alone'

This was the first statement from my wife as I woke up.But I knew there were some hidden constraints underneath.

'What's the condition?',i asked

She smiled and said,'No camera (except ur cell phone),your budget would be 100/- and still need to write a blog with photos,once you come back'

I said yes,but I was thinking how to make it possible.

I started from my place in Chennai around 10am.Before that I took 3 cigs: from my packet and she deducted 15/- for that,so I was left with just 85/-.

I knew the route,so it wasn't difficult for me to point the place but the 'big' question was how to make it with just 85/-.

I took a bus/train and reached Chengelput bus stand.This was a funny place. And even though I could speak Tamil,people were finding it too hard to understand me. After a lot of questions exchanged,One guy just pointed a 'V' and left.I was sitting at the Chengelput bus stand and decoding what the big mystery behind this 'V' was. Suddenly,I saw a bus '121V', brain clicked, and I asked the conductor whether this was
Avianic 'India'
going to Vedanthangal Bird Sanctuary. The guy said in pure Tamil out which i could figure out only 'Padalam'. I heard about this place before so hoped in. The bus dropped me at Padalam Junction. It was like a small 'Freeway spot' with a few shacks around. There were absolutely nothing else. I knew I had to go another 15km from this place to reach Vedanthangal. With no options left,I started walking. Suddenly, i saw one auto fellow with a few passengers just whisked me from behind.I asked him whether he knew about Vedanthangal BS. He nodded,i again hoped in. This vehicle was overflowing with local crowds. And with someone's generousity I managed a corner somewhere inside.I didn't know I was actually on someone's lap that too an old lady. God !! Finally,he dropped me at Vedanthangal Sanctuary around 2pm and surprisingly I was the only person showed up.

I got the tickets and went inside. 'God !! where is this place',was my first interaction. All I could see 'birds'. The world starts and ends here with 'birds'. I didn't know from where they are which class they belong to,but all colorful 'Avians' greeted me wiith their wings flapping
Painted Stork
in this scorching afternoon. With my knowledge,I could spot Painted Storks,Open Billed Storks, Blue Heron and so many. And once I climbed up the watch tower it was 'all white' as far I could see. Most of the birds were busy picking twigs for their nests or nurturing their egss. I spotted some storks with a very unqiue posture. I wasn't sure whether they were showing their 'rear window' to me. After spending 4 hours, I followed the same route way back home. Yes, you would be asking me, whether I could make it within 85/-.

Here's the list :

Bus to Guindy Rly Stn - 5/-
Train to Chengelput - 10/-
Bus to Padalam Junction - 7/-
Auto (in share) - 10/-
Ticket in VBS - 5/-
Return to Chengelput by bus from VBS - 7/-
Train to Gunidy - 10/-
Giundy to my 'home sweet home' by bus - 6/-
I bought a bottle of water - 12 /-
And 2 packs of small Parle Gs - 8/-


So it comes to 80/-.

I still had 5/- left, so I bought a rose for her and said,'I've made it and this one for
Ready to take off
you'.

Thanks all for reading this !!

Little Egrett
'Sir,birds are fine but beware of snakes and they are poisonous too'

This was the first statement from my boat man Madhi and we were hovering around the dense channels of Pichavarm Mangrove Forest.

Couple of years ago, during a java discussion, I was comparing West Bengal with
Tamilnadu. Starting from The Himalayas, Darjeeling when our discussion reached Sunderban,

my peer Sriram said,

'Dude,Sunderban may be the best but we have Pichavaram'

I asked with raising eyebrows, 'Where the hell is that?'

'Just 20kms from Chidambaram Town and don't you know it is the 2nd largest Mangrove forest after Sunderban'

I said,'Man, you must be joking or getting high and dry after two cappuccinos'

Sriram said,'Na,You can refer to any book or site, my information is correct, i've been there'.

It was way back in Spetember,2009 and since then somewhere deep down the core, Pichavaram was
creating a shell. Finally, in March,2012,the shell transformed to a tour.

I started from Pondicherry early in the morning at 6am.The small Pondicherry guest was good but they had too many airborne inhuman squadrons in my room.Yes,I am talking about the mosquitoes. So with long
Inside Pichavaram Forest
stretched and frequent 'yawns',I asked the conductor at the Pondicherry Bus stand,'Chidambaram?'. With a smile he nodded. This is what I like best about Tamilnadu, wherever you travel, you have buses in quick intervals. The bus was almost vacant. Like every 'first boy' does in school and what I never did in my entire educational life,I took the first seat,next to the driver.There were hardly 10 people in the bus.The young lad was at his best.We crossed Cuddalore (24kms from Pondicherry) in no less than an hour.The Pondicherry-Karaikal Port road is amazing and too good for a ride. After a few hop ons and ins,we reached Chidambaram bus stand.It was exactly 9am.Distance between to Pondicherry to Chidambaram is around 78 kms.I was 'starving' for a smoke.I had one then gradually walked inside the terminus. Chidambaram is a divisional town like our Burdawan or Siliguri.I asked one fellow about the buses to Pichavaram.He guided me to the end of the terminus and said that I should look for Bus no '3B'.After 20 minutes I saw a '3B' came inside the stand and before I could grab a seat all the college students had their bags 'marked' in them.I managed a corner
Pichavaram
and was thinking about my next plans. Suddenly, one lad asked me,

'Anna,where are you from?'

'Chennai',I said

'Do you work for CSC?', the guy asked

'yes', I replied

'So my elder brother does and I will work there one day' and offered his seat.

I was surprised with this 'suburb hospitality' that atleast someone heard about my company name here with such respect even my CEO doesn't have for sure. Later,I found that he could figure it out from the backpack I was carrying. It has a CSC logo printed.With those giggling young college students which I was really enjoying their company,I reached Pichavaram at 10:30 am. The bus drove back through the same Pondicherry Road for about 6 kms and then took a right turn towards Killai village and drove further down to Pichavaram.

I never understand that why I always show up being the 'only and lonely' person to
every spot. It was small boathouse with a watchtower on the left and ticket counter on the right.I also found one TTDC guest house and restaurant attached. However, I walked to the ticket counter and surprisingly saw the same person whom
Core Area
I asked about the bus to Pichavaram in Chidambaram bus stand.

'So you took the right bus',he smiled

'My presence answers your question’, I replied with a big 'Bengali' smile.

He was describing the fares for the boat rides,rules and regulations.I paid for 2 seater row boat for two hours.One young lad,hardly in mid twenties named 'Madhi' greeted me with a traditional Tamilian smile.When I was asked about my native and after listening the name 'Bengal',he went on for about a 10 minutes brain jammer with 'what Sunderban has and this place doesn't have'.This is what I like about The Tamilians that they never show what they have. Things apart,I was surprised with his knowledge about the 'Flora and Fauna' of Sunderban and this place. I thanked that 'Ticket Counter guy',I knew he had his best man with me and it was gift of travelling in the same bus from Chidambaram.

'Sir, this two km stretch we need to cover in two hours.I will take you to the 'Dasavatharam'(Famous movie of Kamalhasan'😉 shooting spot and return.Madhi said with a wicked smile.

I knew the drill,I took two hundreds out of my pocket and said,
'I
Dove
have seen Dasavatharam,and I am not interested. Take me deep inside you can'

He grabbed one of them and said,

'Sir,I am taking you to a very scenic and dense canal,but it is risky if the boat gets stuck in mud,we both have to push it.I will make it to a 5 kms ride,but do you have water to drink? as I may need because I will be rowing the boat much faster.If you like then pass on the second note else I don't need'.

I had two bottles of water with me and took them out,kept infront of him,'go ahead'.

He switched route immediately and took me deep inside the forest. Initially it was all enjoyable but after 20 minutes when the forest started getting dense, I was getting my heartbeat rising.It was all green and covered with dense thick mangrove roots. I watched atleast ten different types of birds what I had hardly seen before. At some places the mangrove trees covered and created a thick shed above that you barely could see the sunlight. I was trying to get hold of a root like Tarzan and then Madhi warned me about the snakes
Pichavaram Forest
which eventually turned me into a 'good boy'.Madhi was rowing the boat with all his blood pumped. Atleast thrice the boat got stuck in the mud but he went to knee down shallows and tugged it out. He also caught a couple of huge crabs. I have never seen such huge crabs in my life. One crab weighed 500-700 gms atleast.He took the boat far deeper and then my voice started acting erratic. Yes, I had my veins out,I was scared to go further.Madhi kept on telling me that there were no animals so stay relaxed,but I was scared what if the boat gets stuck completely and some snake curls down from the roots.I went on taking snaps for hours and finally he took me out to the main stretch. It was amazing.I knew that I had to come back again for one reason, My sweetheart. She would have been the happiest person in this galaxy. After spending an hour or so in a few more canals which were not that deep and dense, Madhi rowed me back to the same from where we had started. This guy knew his job,I was more than happy so offered him another two
Life at Pichavaram
hundreds but he took one and requested to post his photos I took. I loved this guy.

After which,I took the bus from Pichavaram to Chidambaram and immediately from Chidambaram to Chennai which took about six and half hours to reach home.

A sanpshot of Pichavaram :

How to go : Rail/Bus : Nearest station is Chidambaram and from there need to take buses/taxis to Pichavaram which is just 15 kms. Bus fare is just 7/- and Taxi from Chidambaram to Pichavaram and back would cost around 700/-

Where to Stay ; Pichavaram has a TTDc bungalow with not much no: of rooms else Chidambaram has plenty of accommodation options that fits within your pocket size.

What to see : Mangrove Forest and plenty of birds.

The boat ride starts from 9 am to 6pm.

Charges : 2 seater rowboat - 220/- for 2 kms/2 hours
4 seater motor boat - 400/- 5kms/2 hours (but motor boats will not go dense inside the forest)
8 seater motorboat - 800/-/2 hours

Please carry your own food as options are limited. Unless you are a freak like me,better to hire a taxi from Chidambaram
Amazing Pichavaram
otherwise buses ply in every one hour from Chidambaram to Pichvaram.

People speak broken English so language could be a problem. Try to reach there as early as possible as riding a boat at 12 noon may not be comfortable. Keep sufficient drinking water with you while riding.Try avoiding weekends as local folks might like to make a trip to this place and you may see a lot of people waiting for boats as they have a limited number of row men.

Once again,thanks for reading this,hope you liked.

Best,
Sumit

India must have more adverts per square mile than any other country in the world, certainly more than any country I have visited anyway. Indian towns are filled to the brim (and often well over the brim) with a sensory overloading array of billboards, posters and signs, you will often even find advertising painted on the side of peoples homes. Every centimetre of space seems to have been claimed by advertising, nothing but nothing is sacred. One of the things that has most surprised me is the amount of advertising that is dedicated to cement. Cement is perhaps the most heavily marketed product in India, I would even hazard a guess that there are more adverts for cement than there are for mobile phones, Bollywood films and soft drinks combined. There are countless cement brands and you will find adverts for them in every town, village, wall in the middle of nowhere and also continuously on radio and TV. I have even noticed a few programs on Indian television are sponsored by cement manufacturers! This plethora of cement advertising struck me as strange initially but I guess it’s not that strange when you consider that India is a country which is
Seafront at Pondicherry
This is a photo from google and not my own, I forgot to take photos here!
advancing/growing rapidly and a country where most construction is generally done by the property owners i.e families build their own homes. The only type of advertising that is more numerous than cement advertising is political advertising, which is so abundant in quantity it is both disturbing and laughable. You literally cannot drive more than 20 metres in any town big or small without seeing some form of political advert, often the same one you saw a few metres down the road. The sight of a (usually ugly) politicians giant face looking down at you can feel a bit Big Brother-esque at times, surely advertising in such quantities is not only a wasteful use of resources but also bordering on propaganda. I’m sure Goebbels would approve.

Sorry got a bit side tracked there, back to the case in hand.

Pondicherry was the governing and administrative centre for the handful of tiny colonies France used to control in India, the town is now famous for its Gallic influence which is visible in the towns design, it’s architecture and customs. Despite not belonging to France these days, (control was relinquished in 1954, Rough Guide, 2011) the French still keep a high

It all feels a bit like the French are trying desperately to hold on to some remnants of past glory, but now have nothing more than the tips of their fingers on the prize. Give it a rest France, the days of empire are long gone.

Pondicherry is a relatively pretty, if not a little dull town. The first few blocks by the seafront contain some nice looking French colonial style buildings and the streets in this section are noticeably less chaotic and chocked with traffic than the blocks that follow behind (which are just like any Indian town i.e complete madness). There is little to do in Pondicherry but it is a pleasant enough place to wander for a few hours. We were all however very excited about the opportunity to eat an actual beef steak, beef is a very rare commodity in largely Hindu India but the French influence in Pondicherry means that cow is very much on the menu here. No I can thank the French for something other than Daft Punk! Peter and myself visited supposedly the best restaurant in town, Le

Club, to try the towns ‘legendary’ French cuisine. I had a sirloin steak with a blue cheese sauce, I asked for my steak rare and it came out blue (how very French), fortunately I don’t mind my steak raw. The sauce was a little salty and thick but still worked well with the steak, the fries that came with the steak were fantastic, really fantastic in fact, the side salad was limp and fairly pointless. Overall I enjoyed my meal but was a bit underwhelmed considering the restaurant was supposedly the best in town and the cost of the food here was dramatically higher than the other restaurants in town.

Other than being famous for being a French enclave Pondicherry is also famous for the Auroville Ashram, which is actually based 12km outside of town. The ashram is actually more like a commune where people from all over the world come to live life an ‘alternative’ self sustaining life style (and smoke lots of pot). I didn’t actually get the chance to visit Auroville as you have to book in advance which I didn’t realise beforehand, it’s a real shame I couldn’t go as I’m sure it would have

been a fascinating experience. There are however signs of Auroville all over Pondicherry, for example most of the people wondering the streets look like they are Auroville hardcore meditators (and Auroville hardcore pot smokers) and many of the hotels/hostels/shops in the city are owned by Auroville and staffed by Auroville devotees. I would love to visit an Ashram one day to see how I found it, I suspect I wouldn’t get on with it very well and would probably get really bored but still I would like to give it a go one day.

We left Pondicherry the following day and headed to our next destination Mamallapuram. Supposedly most people visit Mamallapuram to see its famous temples, especially the shore temple which is built close to the sea and as such has been weathered and smoothed in a unique way by the salty sea air. For us cultural neanderthals however the main attraction was the beach, restaurants with WIFI and for the girls (stereotypical but true) the touristy clothes, jewellery and curios shops. The temple was ok, but it was so hot when we visited that none of us wanted to spend much time there. The beach, which I would describe as fairly average, was littered with signs of the local fishing industry (boats, nets etc) and was backed by scruffy palms, grass and restaurants. While it was not the prettiest beach, it was still a beach and we were pleased to be by the coast again, especially as we had anticipated the beach in Mamallapuram would be an open human toilet rather than something usable. I started my day by indulging in a rather large Thali lunch which was pretty good but not outstanding, I then spent the rest of my time exploring the town, frolicking in the sea and even doing a little bit of shopping, well trying to do shopping, but in reality failing miserably. Apparently the traders of Mamallapuram only sell really awful Peter Panesque trousers in colours that would make even a blind man cry.

The real big event for the group in Mamallapuram however was the farewell party we would hold in the evening for those that would sadly by leaving the tour tomorrow. Unfortunately it was not to be a night of good food or quick service for that matter either. Things started off badly when the waiter tried to sell us fresh fish at quadruple the rate we had paid in Varkala and at a price which would have even seemed a dear at home. In the end we didn’t buy any fresh fish as the waiter would not reduce the prices below a ludicrously inflated rate, it was a foolish strategy on the restaurants behalf as we are a group of 20 and would have purchased a lot of fish if the price was right. Following this incident I was a little annoyed and apprehensive about what was to come but not to the point of serious concern, at this point they still in mind had plenty of time to come good, the food will probably be great I told myself. I decided I would order the seafood platter which at 450rps (5.50 gbp) was comparatively expensive but with a line up of grilled fish, prawns and calamari served alongside vegetable fried rice I thought it would be worth the higher than usual outlay, especially as tonight was a special occasion. After placing my order I went downstairs to give the parents a call using my newly acquired telephone credit. It was really great talking to Mum and Dad, for various reasons it had been difficult to phone home prior to this point so it was really nice to finally be able to have a long chat and hear the news from home. After a 45 min chat to the parents I returned to the restaurant to find that no food and only a few drinks had been served, half of us were still missing our beers, how hard can it be to open a few beers? What on earth had they been doing for 45 mins? This was starting to become ridiculous and I was starting to get seriously hangry (hangry = when you get angry because you are so hungry, thanks for this one Jenny). Apparently the restaurant had run out of cold beer despite Jenny (tour leader) warning them earlier in the day that 20 of us would be coming in and wanting plenty of drinks. I did eventually get a semi cold beer (I’m still not sure where it came from) and my seafood platter after well over an hour’s wait and after some people had already eaten their whole meal. When my plate arrived I felt close to tears, what was this plate of misery and despair doing in front of my eager eyes, surely this could not be mine? Very quickly my despair turned to anger, I had hit boiling point and began to physically shake with rage. Never before has the gap between expectation and reality been starker, I had been sold a deluxe BBQ fishy dream and had been served a diabolical monstrosity a sewer rat would steer clear of. On my plate were 3 badly burnt prawns that tasted of carbon and two pathetic and sad looking tiny fish which looked and smelt like they were probably already past their best in the Jurassic period. I did foolishly try a nibble of the fish and as expected it was truly rancid. My calamari and vegetable rice had obviously been so embarrassed by the state of the prawns and fish that they decided not to show up at all, can’t say I blame them. I’m not a massive fan of complaining in restaurants and typically take the British view that it’s best to smile and pretend everything was great, don’t want to cause a scene now do you. However occasionally something annoys me so much that I have no choice but to make a formal complaint, tonight was justifiably one such occasion. I called the waiter over and pointed out the missing items (calamari and vegetable rice), the hideously black carbonised prawns and above all the dangerously gone off fish. In my most forceful and serious voice I told the waiter that I wouldn’t be paying for my meal and wouldn’t be having any of his funny business telling me otherwise. I did offer however to pay 100 RPS for the prawns as I had eaten them by this point, they were disgusting but I was bloody hungry. The waiter of course didn’t agree at first but I wasn’t going to be overruled, this food was not only terrible but also potentially dangerous. I can feel the rage building up inside me just remembering the experience! In the end they agreed to only charge 100 rps, which was still too much really. I didn’t order anything else as I wasn’t convinced the kitchen could prepare it in less than 5 months and even then who knows what I would actually get, maybe a putrefied rat curry? Sonia did however very kindly share her Chicken Tikka curry and rice with me so I did at least have something to line my stomach. Sounds like the night from hell right? Especially when you consider it wasn’t just me who had a bad food experience. However, for some reason halfway through the night the beer, wine and thus good times started flowing. One of the waiters bought round 2 bottles of just about drinkable local rum which he shared with us, encouraging us all to do shots that were so large they made you gag a little. We had forgotten about the dreadful food and prior terrible service and were now very much having a great time. I have come across a few instances in India where an establishment is very much better at being a bar than a restaurant, this was certainly one such case, as was Rock and Roll in Varkala. So after a very unpromising start things dramatically improved and we all ended up having a really cracking night. It was in the end a fantastic farewell party for a fantastic group of people who really did deserve a good send off.

It was a late night in the end, some of us headed off to bed at the rather unsociable hour of 03.00am, tomorrows early start would be a challenge. Maybe that last kingfisher strong wasn’t such a good idea........

March 1st 2012
Published: March 11th 2012


The drive from Mallaparum to Chennai was not a particularly long one, but we had left early as the truck needed repair work done on it in a garage in Chennai and thus needed to get there as early as possible. This normally would have been fine, but given that we were (most of us anyway) hideously hungover from the previous nights farewell party, an early start was most unwelcome. Already this was starting to be a bad day. Today was always destined to be a sad/bad day however as it was leaving day for many great people whom I had come to know and love. Today we would be saying a sad farewell to the legends that are Sally, Sarah, Bill, Carol, Colin, Marge and Luciana, as well as my very good friends Peter (room buddy for 6 weeks) and Sonia. Upon arrival however my mood was picked considerably by news that Chennai had an American Dinner which served bacon and sausage for breakfast, get me a tuk tuk immediately, I’m there! It took around 10 mins to get us from the hotel to the dinner, although this felt much longer with the heavy weight of anticipation hanging over us. After 10 torturous minutes we arrived, upon arrival I jumped out of the tuk tuk and excitedly ran to the entrance of the dinner, hooray it was bacon and sausage time! With great anticipation I went to open the entrance to the dinner only to then be confronted with the grey shutters of despair, OH NO! The dinner was closed and the lack of human activity inside and out made it look like it wasn’t opening any time soon. Dejected and secretly very close to tears I/we decided we would come back later for dinner and head to KFC instead for breakfast (because you can’t beat 3 pieces of greasy fried chicken at 10.30am, unless it’s 3 pieces of greasy bacon and sausage of course).

I literally did nothing in Chennai, I did not go to explore the sights, I did not go to any museums, I did not go shopping, hell I didn’t even go for lunch. There is apparently little to see in Chennai (not that I could tell you if there was anyway) and to be honest after several days on the go and the previous nights heavy partying, I was keen to have some time to just sit around, sleep and indulge in some much needed slothfulness.

At 17.00 it was time to say goodbye to my very good buddy Sonia, it was an emotional farewell and we were all (myself in particular) sad to see her leave. Sonia I wish you the best of luck in your exam, you are being missed. Shortly after Sonia’s departure it was time for our pre departure meeting with the new people who were joining in Chennai. I hate it when a leg finishes and a new one starts, firstly and perhaps most obviously because you tend to lose people who have become really good friends, in this instance two of my closest and some mighty fine others. Secondly though I hate it because you have to meet new people and I’m always scarred that the new people will be complete assholes and will hate me. I’m not really sure where this fear comes from as on each occasion the new group members have been really great and within 48 hours (or less with beer) we are getting on like old friends. However it is a problem that plagues me and I do find it a real shame that I tend to view the thought of meeting people I don’t know with negativity and dread, which in itself is strange as I tend to get along with most people at least reasonably well. Anyway I’ll save the psycho analysis for a professional when I have a break down in later life..... Peter made a poignant and valid observation saying that he felt sorry for the new people joining in Chennai as they would have to try and blend into a group of people who had known each other for up to 8 weeks (6 weeks in my case). That certainly put things into perspective and made me realise that my concerns and worries were not only trivial but also rather self indulgent. As it turns out (as it always does) the new people were great, we had an English couple, a solo female traveller from Norway, a scots man (better not say British), a Australian gentleman and two English men join us. Once again I was the only bloke under 40 on the truck, however I wasn’t to bothered by this as I had come to realise in recent weeks that being the only young male on a truck full of interesting and beautiful girls isn’t too bad at all <span>:-)

After the pre departure meeting we met with the remaining people from the last leg and headed off for our final supper. Once again we headed towards Sparky’s American Dinner only this time we were really, really hungry and really, really looking forward to a burger. I won’t beat around the bush. Yes, once again it was ******* closed. Oh great. As it turns out Sparky’s had been closed down for 2 weeks and would be closed for another 2 weeks for renovations. There were accusations made within the group that the tuk tuk drivers knew Sparky’s was closed but took us anyway so that they could make a fare. Whether this is true or not I cannot tell you, I can tell you however that the tuk tuk drivers did make a double fare as upon finding Sparky’s was closed we headed straight back to a restaurant on the same road as our hotel, make of that what you will. We did eventually get some food and very good it was too, unfortunately we were all a little terse after the Sparky’s experience and perhaps also because our restaurant of choice did not sell beer. As such, our farewell meal was not perhaps as jovial as well had all hoped, still it was a great meal and it was nice to spend some time together before the inevitable sad goodbyes. My final goodbye of the day and perhaps the most poignant was to my ex room buddy Peter. We had become close over the past 6 weeks and formed a perhaps surprisingly close friendship, something I’m sure neither of us would have anticipated on day one. For me it had been a real education learning that age does not necessarily have to define your personality and outlook on life. Peter is as sharp, witty, carefree and up for it as anyone I know of my own age and was often much more up for doing/trying things than the ‘younger’ people on the tour. Peter I hope you are enjoying smoking your Cuban cigars at your free will and I hope plans for your summer of sailing are progressing well. I look forward to joining you in the Adriatic for a stint in 2013 if I don’t see you sooner.

Tomorrow we would be heading for Tirupati to visit the temple of Lord Venkateshwara, the busiest and richest temple in India (supposedly).....

Hi!

God, I've had a tough few days. Sometimes India can be a bitch.

It wasn't bad in a near-death way, just night buses with overweight man next to me, overpriced hotels with people that woke me up at 5.30 to get me to check out, feeling sick, nothing working, no water or electricity and a general bad mood - bad. So, just India-bad.

But! Now it's all better. I'm in a gorgeous little town, a world-heritage sight full of temples and rock carvings. I have a tiny little room, that I'm paying close to nothing for, a hope that I will make it out of Delhi somehow, and if I don't I just pay some ridiculous sum of money for a nice hotel room and go clubbing. Yay!





So, here's the deal. I don't really want to see the Taj Mahal. I know, it's a must-doo-must-see-must-not-die-without-it, but I just can't be bothered. It's a detour, it's full (!!!) of tourists, it's just a building.

There, I've said it. It might be a bad idea, as I just might end up doing it anyway if I can't get the train I want, but .. There's so many other things I would much rather spend my money and time on. Like the golden temple in Amritsar, a camel safari, a nice curry, the bazaars in Delhi and Mumbai, maybe even something ridiculous like a huge stone Shiva figure that I've been eying all day.



I must say, even with all it's annoying aspects, I love this country. Where ells does the rickshaw driver ask you to come to his house and meet his family, the women bathing in their saris, the spice plantation workers ask you to join you for their coffee break on the ground, the local struggling man use his only day off to show you around his town, the families gather around to get a photo taken with the foreigner, the cyclists carry huge piles of empty pots and pans on their backs, the street food taste as good as any restaurant food and elderly ladies hug you from behind in the line to the temple?

Cute.

Krishna's Butter Ball
Its been a while since I last wrote but I've ben very very busy doing nothing at all.

After leaving Kovalam I popped up to Trivandrum which is only a few miles up the road to catch a flight to Chennai (Madras). Spent the night there but didn't really do alot except eat, drink and sleep. Durring the day there was a huge march/demo on the main road outside the hotel. Not sure what it was all about but quite a few people were carring big pictures of uncle Joe Stallin, Karl Marx and Lenin so i'm going to take a stab in the dark and say it was something to do with the communist state government.

Had an uneventfull flight from there up to Chennai but only passed through on my way an hour down the coast to Mamallapuram. I had planed on a few days there before moving on but I really liked it and am running out of steam a bit so stopped for ten days in the end. Its only a small place large village rather than a town and is famous for the five rathas (temples carved out of solid rock), rock carvings, Krishna's
Sunbathing Cow
butter ball and local rock carvers.

I'd seen most of the sites in the first few days so spent about a week just wandering around watching the carvers at work and lounging in the garden of the place I was staying reading and watching the resident troop of monkeys up to no good. Had to be carfull not to leave anything unattended or the next thing you know theres a monkey up a tree wearing your Y fronts on his head.

The only downside to the place was the constent power cuts. Its a big problem in tamil nadu so the torch i bought with me was worth its weight in gold.

After leaving mamallapuram it was a quick trip through Chennai again for the flight to Mumbai for the last few days before flying home. I had my name called over the tanoy at the airport as secruity weren't happy about something. Luckily they just wanted to search my hold luggage, had visions of the old rubber glove and the inability to sit down for a week!!

So I'm now right back where I started 3 months ago in Mumbai. Saw some more filming going
Rock Carving
on this morning right next to the place i'm staying, hung around again in the hope of bollywood stardum but it wasn't to be just ended up having a barney with the secruity bloke about weather or not i could take photos. He said I couldn't I gave him a lesson in some of the more colourfull words in the English language.

So thats it for another year will see some of you in a few days and will continue with the blog in December, have no idea where it will be from so let me know if you have any ideas.

Madurai (17)
Madurai
Weetje : dansen is zeer belangrijk voor Indiërs. Naar verluid even belangrijk als seks! De klassieke Tamil dans telt 108 heilige posities. Standjes, zeg maar (...of was ik toch in het verkeerde boek aan 't lezen?).



Neen hoor, ze staan allemaal afgebeeld op de oostelijke gopuram van het Nataraja Tempel (Chidambaram)



















Maandag 20/02/2012 - Van Trichy naar Madurai











De Chaos in Tiruchirappalli (Trichy) is nog een graad erger dan wat we tot hiertoe al hebben ervaren. Maar ook chaos went. Wat niet went is het onophoudelijk getoeter van wat maar rijdt! In alle toonaarden. Te pas en te onpas.











De Sri Rangatanathaswamy tempel, gewijd aan Vishnu, gaat door als de grootste in India. In feite lijkt het meer op een ingesloten stad dan op een gebedsplaats. Om binnen te geraken moet je maar even door 7 'gopuram's' (rijkelijk/overdadig versierde poorten, waarvan de grootste 73 m hoog is. Eigenlijk begint de tempel zelf bij de 4de
Trichy (2)
omwalling. Spijtig genoeg is het interessantste deel enkel toegankelijk voor Hindoes.



Een verscholen trapje laat je toe een glimp op te vangen van het gouden dak van het 'inner sanctum'.











Je kunt er uren, zelfs dagen in het doolhof van gangen verloren lopen, maar voor leken als wij, valt er weinig te zien. Zij het de gebruikelijke drukte van pelgrims en brahmanen, die, deze keer, 3 verticale strepen (teken van Vishnu) op het voorhoofd dragen. Een beetje teleurstellend na de tempels van de voorbije dagen.











De 437 treden naar de Rock Fort tempel, hebben we gelaten voor wat ze waren. De planken van onze voeten zijn al dermate geteisterd, dat deze beklimming ons net een brug te ver leek.











Op weg naar Madurai stoppen we nog even aan een crematieplaats, of beter gezegd waar de rituele verstrooiing van de assen in de rivier wordt gehouden, 10 dagen na de crematie. Je kan je er ook wassen en zelfs een lekker plonsje doen... (je zult
Trichy (3)
dan wel even je grootouders of geburen of enige onbekende onderweg moeten groeten als ze voorbij drijven...)



















Dinsdag 21/02/2012 – Madurai











Volgens Lonely Planet mag Chennai zich het hart van Tamil Nadu noemen, maar Madurai claimt haar ziel te zijn. En waarschijnlijk terecht ook.











Buiten Chaos (het gaat nog altijd crescendo!) staat Madurai - letterlijk de 'stad van honing' - nog voor een prachtig tempelcomplex : de Sri Meenakshi Temple. 6 hectare groot, 12 'gopurams' en een myriade beelden gewijd aan Meenaskshi Amman, de 3-borstige godin met de 'visogen'. Vergis u niet : 3 borsten is onvolmaakt, maar 'visogen' zijn volgens de Tamil-dichtkunst het summum van perfectie.



En wie is nu Meenakshi? Gewoon een andere naam voor Parvati. Niet eens een avatar of andere gedaante, neen. Gewoon een andere naam. Je zou voor minder de tel kwijtraken. Shiva, haar echtgenoot, heet hier dan ook, voor de gelegenheid, maar Sundareswarar.



Btw : die 3de
Trichy (4)
borst, die heeft Shiva – de Vernietiger – deskundig... vernietigd! Zonder littekens achter te laten of course. Plastische chirurgie 'avant la lettre' als het ware.











Alle gekheid op een stokje, de tempel is meer dan een bezoekje waard!

Weird temple at Southern tip - Looks like it was designed/inspired by Disney World
Today marked two important symbolic events. One, we visited the Southernmost point in India, yey! Two, it was the halfway point for our trip, boo! (well it was yesterday in truth but that ruins the symbolism of today). I should also note that this will be published well after the day in question, so the date of publishing is not the same as the day referred to above.

The Southern tip of India is a fairly unremarkable place, much like Lands End is a fairly unremarkable place, in fact I imagine many countries extremities despite being major tourist attractions are actually fairly unremarkable, if not just plain boring. The Southern tip does have a few things going for it however. Firstly it is the Southern tip of India which is in itself an achievement. Secondly being the Southern tip it is surrounded by water which is handy because it is bloody hot, even though it was technically ‘winter’ when we visited, it was still about 37 degrees. Thirdly Jenny (our TL) designated today a tuna sandwich lunch day, yey! Now that may not sound very exciting to you, but when you rarely get to eat a decent western style sandwich
More cases of animal abuse in India
(with actual mayo!) then the thought and taste of some tinned tuna, a bit of cheap mayo and some warm cucumber seems like a real luxury. It’s actually quite nice that you come to view things like a tuna sandwich (and a hot water shower) as a luxury, it’s nice to appreciate and get excited about things that you would normally be so blasé about.

While at the Southern tip, we dipped our feet into the water, ate (devoured in my case) tuna sandwiches, admired the odd statue of Tamil saint Thiruvalluvar that is built on an island just off the Southern Peninsula and shooed off an army of very persistent hawkers who were selling the crappiest looking fake pearl necklaces I have ever seen.

We left the Southern tip around 14.00 and headed towards Madurai arriving around 17.30ish. For the past few weeks I had almost forgotten we were in India, Kerala is a wealthy state with low levels of poverty and we had been staying in small touristy resorts which were somewhat disconnected from the day to day life of ordinary Indians. However, Madurai (the second largest city in the state of Tamil Nadu) brought home
Walkting towards the water at the Southern tip
with a bang that we were still very much in India. The experience was somewhat reminiscent to the initial culture (and noise) shock I received when arriving in Delhi. Madurai is over populated, noisy, smelly, manic, chaotic and did I mention really bloody noisy? But, in a way it was nice be back in the chaos, we had been sheltered for the past few weeks and it was to feel like we were travelling through real (whatever real means) India again. Upon arrival me and my soon to be ex room buddy (boo!) Peter went for a beer (he really is a bad influence!) at a cheap, working mans drinking establishment. It was a pretty grim place but interesting in it’s grimness nonetheless. We were pretty sure drink would be cheap here given the owners obviously weren’t paying much for the upkeep of the premises, or the upkeep of the refrigerators for that matter judging by the warmness of our beer. Sure enough when the waiter asked us for 150 RPS for two beers (about 2GBP) we felt very happy at the price. However upon receiving 150rps from us the cheeky bugger said “no, no it’s 450 rps”, to which
Cooling off at the Southern tip
we said “no bloody way you cheeky ****”. Ok we didn’t actually say this but we certainly made it clear we would not pay 450 rps (about 5.50 GBP) for two beers. Beer ranges in price but typically you pay between 75-150rps (1-2 GBP) per beer, this greedy **** was trying to charge us 225rps per beer which is more than we paid for beer in Indigo one of Mumbai’s best and most expensive restaurants. We refused to pay more than 150rps per beer (still too much really) and then left a little pissed off but ultimately more concerned about dinner, lunch had been a long time ago and we were hungry.

Tomorrow we would be visiting Madurai one of India’s oldest cities and indeed one of the oldest in South Asia (or so the Rough Guide claims)...........

View of Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple approaching from a nearby street
I would like to start today’s entry with a little gloating, never a good way to start I know. I’m sorry to start off in such a rude manner but I’m afraid it really must be done. I would like to let all of you in cold, wet and windy Britain know that to this date it has only rained once since I arrived in India and I don’t believe we have had a single cloudy day. Yes your right, I am a smug ****. The one time it did actually it did so at night so we didn’t even get wet, no surprises for guessing where it rained, my favourite Indian town ever (not), Cochin. Would be wouldn’t it. Anyway it’s pretty damn amazing that in over a month I haven’t seen a drop of rain or even anything but a blue cloudless sky, thank you India. Commiserations to all of you at home.

I was super tired waking up in Madurai, maybe it was the long drive the day before, maybe the 4 bottles of Kingfisher strong or maybe the post Varkala hangover finally kicking in. Whatever it was I was not the only person feeling it, several
The west gate at Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple
people appeared to be tired and in a foul mood. Not perfect conditions for what would be a long day with 3 temple viewings. Our long suffering but ever patient tour leader Jenny had a particularly torrid time in the morning by having to deal with an unusually uncooperative group before later getting her foot run over by a motorbike. I was very impressed that Jenny didn’t make a big deal about it at all and just got on with her job/day. It must be tough in these situations to maintain your professionalism, I really admire Jenny and other tour leaders as they really do have to deal with so much.

We were in Madurai to visit the Sri Meenakshi- Sundareshwarar temple, one of the busiest and largest in South India, the Rough Guide describes the temples gopuras (pyramid like structures) as “the greatest man made spectacle of the South”. The temple is dedicated to both Shiva and Meenakshi who were married and lived in Madurai from which they ruled the Pandya kingdom.

The temple was surrounded by a large pedistrianised area, the first (and probably last) I have seen in India, it was heavenly! The temple complex
Meenakshi Sundareswarar Temple
is to use a much misused/overused word (often by myself), epic, epic in both size and stature. The four gates to the temple are each topped by large, brightly (some may say gaudily) coloured and intricately carved gopuras) which contain carvings of 1,001 gods related too or incarnations of Shiva/Meenakshi. The gopuras are spectacular, the carving is not only extraordinarily intricate but also impressive in it’s sheer quantity, I imagine the gopuras took a very long time complete (we were probably told how long but I have forgotten, apologies, C- try harder next time). Madurai temple is very much a working temple and was full of local and non local worshippers, apparently around 15,000 people visit the temple every day. It was probably the most spiritual temple I have visited in India, it felt like an Oasis of calm in a town/country of craziness. The temple was full of chanting worshippers (some, including women, with fully shaven heads) and holy men who often appeared in a trance like state. The spirituality and devotion of the worshippers was really quite moving, it felt like a privilege to glimpse people worshipping in a temple which was obviously of great importance to them.

I really enjoyed the Meenakshi temple but after our visit I was feeling pretty tired, pissy and really not in the mood for the afternoon drive and double temple visit we had scheduled in Trichy, our next stop.

We visited both temples in Trichy, one was built on top of a rock and was unsurprisingly called the rock fort. The temple, which is dedicated to Ganesh was average and nothing worth getting excited about, it did however have pretty decent views over the city, but was it worth the 400 step climb? Probably not in all honesty, but then again I was in a bad mood and it was really bloody hot. The second temple, Sri Ranganathaswamy is apparently the largest Hindu temple complex in India and is spread across 60 hectares. It was impressive in it’s size but the actual temples in the complex were spread quite far apart and not particularly impressive, in fact in parts the temple looked like an unfinished building site (oh dear I was having a day). Ranganathaswamy temple like Meenakshi temple in Madurai is very much a working temple, however it was so crazy and busy that I didn’t get the
Looking down at Trichy from Uchipillaiyar Koil rockfort temple
same sensation of it being a spiritual place, especially with all the motorbikes, rickshaws and cheap tat traders who were making an unholy amount of noise on the outskirts of the complex. It’s a shame that both of the temples in the afternoon were of little interest, although I guess we have been spoilt and a little overloaded with temples on this tour and in all honesty temples aren’t of massive interest to me. On another note we didn’t have a guide for the Trichy temples which probably didn’t help endear me to the temples.

Tomorrow we would be heading to Pondicherry (known as Puducherry these days) where we pleasingly wouldn’t have to look at any more temples.........

Tempeldanseres
Thanjavur
We zijn inmiddels in Madurai beland. We zijn maar 4 dagen in India, en worden overspoeld door indrukken :

- een gids die Stalin heet, en een chauffeur Nelson...

- Engels leren herkennen dat helemaal niet op Engels lijkt...

- tempels in alle vormen en maten...
- je blote voeten verbranden op de oververhitte plavuizen van de tempels...

- de chaostheorie aan de lijve ondervinden...

- ... en de mensenzee!



Zaterdag 18/02/2012 - Van Pondy naar Tanjur






In Puducherry, beter bekend als 'Pondy' zijn er meer katholieke kerken dan tempels of moskeeën. Een van de belangrijkste bezienswaardigheden is de Sri Aurobindo Ashram, mede gesticht door een Franse dame, die bekend werd als 'The Mother'. In India zijn alle meditatieve groeperingen erg in trek. Waar je ook maar in gelooft of wilt in geloven, je vindt heus wel je gading.

Verder is Pondy een heus belastingparadijs : deze autonome enclave in Tamil Nadu is namelijk een afzonderlijke 'staat', die bijzonder taksvriendelijke politiek voert.

Volgens Nelson, heb je daar de grootste verzameling dronkaards in India. Reden : geen taks op alcohol. Dit in tegenstelling met Tamil Nadu,
Nataraja tempel 1
Chidambaram
waar disuasieve heffingen bestaan. Daarentegen wordt in Tamil Nadu wel ganja gebruikt. Illegaal en... zonder taksen!

En de diesel : 42 Roepies tov 44 per liter. 2 Roepies (€0.03) verschil! Nelson geraakt er helemaal van opgewonden. “you see, no taxes!” (voor mij is het verschil <5%! (MISSING)Als dat de Belgische aanslagvoet was, kon ik daar perfect mee leven! Ga dat maar eens uitleggen...).




Op weg naar naar Thanjavur (Tanjore), ook wel Tanjur genoemd, liggen een aantal belangrijke tempels op ons te wachten:

- de Nataraja tempel in Chidambaram

- de tempel van Gangakondacholapuram

- Airatesvara tempel in Dharasuram

- Brihadishwara tempel in Thanjavur zelf.

Hoewel alle 4 gewijd aan Shiva, zijn ze erg verschillend qua stijl, maar vooral qua sfeer.

Nataraja betekent zoveel als 'Lord of the dance', en verwijst naar de danswedstrijd tussen Shiva en zijn echtgenote Parvati. Deze laatste verloor en werd pisnijdig en nam de gedaante aan van Kali, de gevreesde wraakgodin!

We gaan niet teveel uitweiden over alle symbolen en stijlen, we zijn tenslotte zelf maar leken.

De Hindoecultuur neem je met al je zinnen op :

- je blote voeten worden
Nataraja tempel 2
Chidambaram
gekweld door de oververhitte (en niet altijd even propere) tempelplavuizen

- allerlei parfums (en minder fraaie aroma's) prikkelen je neusgaten

- de klanken, het licht...

Dit alles in een schijnbaar complete wanorde





En als je de tempel verlaat keer je terug naar de complete (verkeers)chaos. Nooit gezien. Buiten alle proporties... en toch vloeit het!

Vuilnisophaling
Mamallapuram
Uitgesteld is niet verloren.

Toch heeft het vakantiegevoel op zich laten wachten... en India naar zich laten smachten!

Het was nochtans veelbelovend begonnen : onze vlucht van Brussel naar Frankfurt was precis 'on schedule'.

Op weg van Terminal A naar -B begon de twijfel binnen te sluipen : op de affichageborden, nergens geen melding van een vlucht naar Delhi van 22:10 ???

Na her en der wat tegenstrijdige informatie te hebben verzameld, viel het verdict : de vlucht was gecanceld. We zouden moeten wachten tot de volgende dag.

Inmiddels had de luchtvaartmaatschappij ons een hotel geregeld en overgeboekt op de vlucht van donderdag... Verder aandringen of jammeren had geen zin, er was gewoon geen alternatief!

Wachten... en trachten je niet te ergeren... slapen... wachten... WACHTEN...

... en BALEN!

Donderdag 16/02/2012

Ze hebben er de spanning tot op het laatste in gehouden : zowat de helft van de voorziene vertrekken werden gecanceled!!! 😞 We vernamen later dat er een staking aan de gang was .

Maar rond 18:00 verscheen onze vlucht op de borden, en we konden (bijna) op tijd vertrekken.





Vrijdag 17/02/2012 - Mamallapuram

Mamallapuram


's Ochtends, bij de landing in Delhi, is het reeds 28 graden C .



In Chennai (Madras) over 30 C.



Puffen, maar niet klagen, want we zijn er uiteindelijk geraakt.



We vluchten meteen de drukte van Chennai en trekken door naar Mamallapuram (Mahaballipuram), een klein vissersdorpje met een UNESCO erfgoed site.



Even uitblazen aan zee.








Zaterdag 18/02/2012 - van Mamallapuram naar Pondicherry




Oorspronkelijk gepland om hier 2 nachten te spenderen om een volle dag te kunnen besteden aan het verkennen van de archeologische sites... en wat te bekomen van de jetlag.



Maar we hebben tijd in te halen, dus een tandje bijzetten.



Een spoedcursus Hindoe-mythologie ( je weet wel, van Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva en de respectievelijke echtgenotes en reïncarnaties...), in een behoorlijk verstaanbaar Engels, was een absolute must, maar de verhalen zijn zo ingewikkeld dat we onze versverworven kennis verder zullen moeten bijspijkeren.



Stalin, onze gids (neen, dit is heus géén politiek statement !), leidt ons deskundig rond de belangrijkste bezienswaardigheden :



- de
Image00003
Mamallapuram
gebeeldhouwde rotsen met het verhaal van het lijden van Arjuna (lijden heeft in India wel een heel andere connotatie dan bij ons);



- de vijf Ratha's (strijdwagens)



- het idyllisch strandtempeltje.









Nadien voert Nelson, onze chauffeur (neen, hij heeft niets weg van een admiraal), ons verder zuidelijk naar Puducherry (Pondichérry), een voormalig Frans handelspost. Hier heerst nog een vleugje koloniale nostalgie :



- de Franse kwartieren (de 'blanke stad'😉, met Franse straatnamen als 'Rue Dumas' en 'Rue Surcouf';

- de typische képie van de locale politie;

- de 'Croisette' langs het strand;

Hier worden nog grote festiviteiten gehouden op 14 Juli, al hebben deze nog weinig te maken met de inname van de Bastille...

Ruth and I woke at 3.30am and were checked out and in a cab to the airport by 3.45am the trip at this time of the morning was fast and hassle free. We both leave from the same terminal at Delhi Airport which is a real bonus. On arrival we checked in Ruth's bags for her Singapore flight then lodged mine for Chennai which took significantly longer. I then walked Ruth to passport control we said our semi sad farewell as I know she is keen to go home and then watched her through the glass until she moved beyond and out of sight.

I then headed to domestic departures (where I met my girlfriend LOL) and made my way though having a few moments panic when I forgot to retrieve my small pack after putting it through the scanner. I was almost at the gate when I realised so I sprinted back to where I left it and was accosted by security who began lecturing me, not really necessary as I felt stupid as it was. I then headed for my gate, I was the only one there when they started boarding, but soon the plane began to fill
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
up, the last person on was sitting in front of me, first he tried to jam a huge bloody bag into the luggage rack which crushed everyone else’s belongings and then he immediately laid his seat back. I napped a little on this flight so it was soon over and I had swapped the chilly madness of Delhi for the humid madness of Chennai.

When I disembarked I messaged Padraic to see if he was in Chennai or already in Madurai, fortunately (for me) he had been bumped from a flight and was sitting in the lounge so I joined him there and spent the next four hours drinking beer, eating little sandwiches and muffins and chatting. Finally at 2.30pm we boarded a small forty seat aircraft and banked out over the ocean heading for Tamil Nadu's second largest city.

Madurai is a surprisingly peaceful and a very clean city (compared to those in the North), I saw very few cows and dogs and the ones I did see appear to be in much better condition as well. We were met at the airport by our new driver and visited the fantastic five hundred year old Tirumalai Nayak
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
Palace that had been partially and tactfully restored. The Mariamman Teppakkulam Tank (artificial lake) with a pretty temple in the centre was our next destination it is generally dry and used by the local kids as a cricket pitch but due to a recent festival we found it full of water and finally the massive and gaudy Sri Meenakshi Temple it is by far the most impressive Hindu temple complex I have seen and a World Heritage site. We walked around the temple for sometime taking snaps it was surprisingly clean inside and the complex was very interesting although I was disappointed to see a temple elephant that looked in poor condition.

It was then on to the hotel I had pre-booked, unfortunately there was no room for Padraic so the driver took him somewhere else. We caught up for dinner on the roof later, the food was quite good but the mosquitoes where menacing.

The next morning we were packed up and on the road by 9am, the driver had over slept (as they do) and I wasn't happy so I let his boss know about it and he soon arrived and we began the long drive
Tirumalai Nayak Palace
Madurai
to Ooty. The traffic here is light, the sky is blue, there is little garbage strewn about and the cows don’t appear to be eating plastic, I am truly amazed. The weather is also dry like Adelaide so I am in my element.

We drove for five or six hours arriving in mountainous Coonoor in the Western Ghats around 3.30pm the last hour in the mountains was extremely picturesque and I saw a different species of Langur monkey which was a bit of a surprise. On arrival at the station we booked tickets on the toy train to Ooty (Udhagamandalam), all the first class tickets were booked out so we had to put up with cattle class, fortunately it was a short trip and not very interesting I must admit I had expected nicer views. Ooty is a hill station set up by the British in the early 1800's as a cool summer haven, and it is easy to see why, it is pleasant here and although it has grown since the days of the British it hasn’t lost all its charm with many a pretty church. Padraic and I wandered down to the main part of town for
Mariamman Teppakkulam Tank
Madurai
dinner I grabbed some drugs for my stomach and some great homemade chocolate which they sell everywhere. We stopped for a pleasant dinner before returning to the hotel.

The next morning we moved on to the National Park at Mudumalai it was a short drive, so we had most of the day to wait till we went into the park in the late afternoon, so we just watched the cricket in the lodge's entertainment area and enjoyed the relaxing natural setting, there are quite a few monkeys here and some pretty birds.

At 3.30pm we headed for the park where we were loaded on a noisy old bus and driven around for about thirty minutes and saw nothing, this of course made me extremely angry so I tried to find another way to get in and see another tiger, unfortunately there is no other way, and they rarely see any major wildlife here. We then watched some villages bathing their elephants in the river before returning to the lodge.

Kort
Hey hey!

Det her bliver en hurtig update, bare saadan for at befrie mig selv for at vaere haabloest bagud.

Lige nu er jeg i Madurai, stadig Sydindien, saadan lidt midt i det hele i staten Tamil Nadu (se kort, hvis jeg kan finde ud af at tiilfoeje det). Madurai er endnu en storby, langt mere kaotisk end Mysore og langt varmere. Men vi bevaeger os snart videre, heldigvis. Indtil da har vi valgt at gaa helt bananas og bruge 200 (!!!) kroner paa et hotelvaerelse med A/C, varmt vand, et toilet med skyl, et rigtigt bad, en bloed seng, en dyne og inkl morgenmad.. Det er helt skoert, og tre gange hvad vi normalt ville bruge paa et hotel, men det er bare saa dejligt!

Mit budget er ikke glad for at jeg rejser rundt med min ven Tom, man bruger mange flere penge naar man er to. Man minder hinanden om hvor rart en skaal med pasta ville vaere, og pludselig befinder man sig paa helt aandssvag dyr vestlig restaurant. Hm.

Naa men anyways! Sidst jeg forlod jer svar jeg paa vej til Ooty, som vi tog fra igaar. Ooty var koldt! Som i fire taepper hver nat, alle butikker fulde af sweatre, man tager sokker paa nar man skal op og tisse om natten - koldt.

Det var skoent at fryse lidt igen, og da det var i bjergene har jeg brugt den sidste uge paa at vandre, bestige bjerge og faa vabler.

Vi fandt en hyggeligt lille hotel med udsigt over the plantaerne, ejet af et aeldre par der mindede mig om en hyggelig onkel og tante eller saadan noget. Vildt soede, villige til at hjaelpe med hvad det skulle vaere. Og de havde denne her kaere lille gamle mand ansat, uden en ploek i munden, han var maaske 1.45 hoej og gik bare rundt og grinede til alle.

Vi kunne ikke lade vaere med at blive der i fem dage, det var bare for rart til at lade vaere.

Men da vi efterhaanden havd set alt hvad der var vard at se, koebt alle de gyselige sweatre vi kunne finde. (Jeg fandt en med en snemand. Jeg aner ikke hvornaar jeg nogensinde vil tage den paa igen, men den var bare saa dejlig at jeg nu slaeber rundt paa den) og shoppet boeger i massevis (igen, hvornaar laerer jeg at jeg ligesom skal baere de her ting og jeg snart ikke kan frasortere mere af mit toej uden at gaa noegen rundt?) syntes vi at det var paa tide at komme videre.

Vi forsoegte os foerst med togstationen. Manden bag disken var ikke glad for at vi saadan skulle komme og stille spoergsmaal midt i hans arbejdstid, saa det fik vi ikke meget ud af. Vi tror vist nok der ikke var plads paa nogle toge.. Maaske. Vi gav i hvert fald op.

Istedet fik vi den brilliante ide at give os i kast med de doedsfaelder man kalder ""government busses"" heromkring. Jasaa.. Ti timer. Paa bjergveje der er placeret som om man taenkte ""Hvordan kan vi goere disse veje mest latterligt smalle og faa presset saa mange blinde vinkler og blinde kurver og blinde turns ind som muligt?""

Heldigvis tog vi dagsbussen i stedet for natbussen, for som vores chauffoer sagde ""I drive bus back to Ooty tonight, no problem!"" og da vi spurgte hvornaar han sov grinede han bare. Naaja, hvem behoever ogsaa soevn? Pf, toesedrenge!

Jeg sad paa forsaedet. Bare saadan at hvis nu vi ramte noget saa ville jeg i det mindste bare ryge ud, det syntes jeg var en beroligende tanke. Og saa kunne jeg straekke benene. Fordel.

Jeg vil ikke give for mange detaljer, lad mig bare sige at jeg var glad for at vi have koebt snacks i massevis og at vi kom ud derfra i live.



Imorgen aften tager vi nattoget til den aller sydligste spids af Indien, hvor tre have moedes: Det arabiske hav, det Indiske ocean og Bay of Bengal (hvad kalder vi det paa dansk?).. Vi kan naa at fange solopgangen da vi ankommer meget tidligt om morgenen. Jeg glaeder mig, det er fantastisk smukt siger folk.

Foerst skal vi lige naa at se Madurai dog. Her i Madurai finder man det kaemplestore tempel Meenakshi Temple for den fiskeoejede, gudinde med tre bryster som jeg ikke lige kan huske navnet paa lige nu. Hun blev foedt med tre bryster, og proffetien sagde at det tredje bryst ville smelte naar hun moedte hendeskommende mand. Det skete da hun moedte Shiva, den hinduistiske gud der er ansvarlig for alt hvad de sker paa jorden, en af de vigtigste guder i Hindu religionen.

Jeg maa sige, jeg er paa mange maader fascineret af hvor komplet meningsloest dette land er. Altsaa, enorme paladser, moskeer og templer. Enorme! Men lige ved siden af disse fantastiske bygninger ligger der mennesker og sover i deres egen affoerring, uden at nogen tager notits af det.

En ting er at det er en del af deres kultur osv osv. Men helt aerligt, det haenger ikke sammen at nogle ting fungerer fuldstaendigt flydende, imens andre ting simpelthen er ved at falde fra hinanden. Naa men nok om det, lad mig slutte af med en lille festivals historie:



En aften i Mysore gik vi en tur, og hoerte musik fra en sidegade. Vi gik derned, og moeder en flok mennesker der staar og stirrer paa to smaa drenge der bliver holdt oppe ved skuldrene af to voksne maend. De to drenge har en form for tavle omkring deres hals med nogle hindu guder afbilledet.

Der bliver trommet helt vildt, og de her to drenge hopper op og ned i total ekstase og ligner nogen der er ved at besvime. Naar de bliver for traette til at hoppe loefter maendene dem bare indtil de kan selv igen.

Bagved deer der en lang raekke religioease maend i en form for hellig dragt der bestaar af et roedt kleade. Det lader til at en af kravene for at kunne baere dette er at vaere lidt for tyk til at det rigtigt kan daekke, men de er vist meget vigtige mennesker.

Saa foelger der en kaempe vogn fuld af blomster og offergaver til en gud (er ikke sikker paa hvilken, det var en meget lille figur i stolen oppe paa vognen) med nogle enorme trae hjul, der bliver hevet frem af diverse frivillige ved hjaelp af kaempe reb. Hjulene saa hele tiden ud til at vaere ved at falde af. Nogle af de anatte i templet begyndte saa at smadre kokosnoedder ned i jorden saa maelk og kokosnoed sproejtede til alle sider, hvilket alle boernene loeber hen for at faa fat paa. Derefter loeber de alle sammen efter en eller anden fyr med en kurv af banener paa hovedet som han kaster efter dem.. Alle griner, vi er totalt maaloese. En hel del kvinder graeder naar vognen kommer taet paa, og de giver deres lille kurv med frugt osv til at ofre til den lille figur af en gud.

Vognen triller forbi (ikke i flyvende fart som man nok kan forestille sig) og efterlader ikke andet end lidt blomsterblade og sinddsygt meget kokos over det hele paa gaden.

Tom og jeg kiggede paa hinanden. trak paa skuldrene og gik ud for at finde noget mad. Hvad kan man sige, this is India.

India in colors
By Polona
Arrival


After blast of from Colombo airport we have hardly been mid air for half an hour, when the pilot announced that we should prepare for landing (hence also a really sad and small lunch we got on the aeroplane: pack of nuts and a small pack of apple juice, not impressed, not at all 😊 Sorry Umar, no new photos for you.).So an hour later we touched ground in India, more exactly at the Tiruchirapali airport.

We were standing in line, to have our passports checked, when we noticed 2 rooms with glass doors and 2 beds in them: they were his and hers Entry refusal room. It kinda sends shivers down your spine when you are still waiting in line and we started thinking, how horrible it would be, if we got locked up, as it looked like you were in a zoo of some sorts, everyone could take a peek and see what you are up to. Next to the rooms was of course also an Interrogation room. Welcome to India, eh?

When it was finally our turn, the man demanded arrival forms, which we didn't have. Funnily enough, everyone got one at
Roof
the Colombo airport, except for us. So we had to go back in line and this Indian woman filled out the forms for us. Back in line and we were finally heading towards baggage claim. We took our backpacks and were on our way out of the airport, when we were stopped and asked to produce yet another paper, so we can take our bags out. We had the paper, so we were finally out and met a huge and persistent crowd of tuk tuk drivers. According to our guide book, there were local buses going from the airport to town, so we went to the main road and waited. In the end, tired and a bit confused we took a tuk tuk driver to get us to “Trichy”.
Trichy


We entered into a complete chaos, but it was not time to sit down yet, we had to find a place to stay first. So off we were: first place had rooms available, but when Jan and I went to check one, it only took one look and we almost ran out of the hostel. Next one: full, next one: full, next one: full...you get the picture from here
Madurai temple(s)
onwards. We walked to about 8 different hostels, all were full (apparently there was some big wedding in town for the weekend), one of them was only for business purposes (you know, “business”, when you rent the room for half an hour 😊), and then we found one. It was a bit more expensive, but it was clean, and they had room (Ashby hotel, 800rp per night)..

OK, to the next mission: finding food. There were loads of local restaurants, so we walked into one that was quite packed, we wanted to sit down, when we were told to move to another room, so we did, and we were told to move to another room, a compartment, which was completely separate from the rest of the place, it was closed up, but it did have AC. We felt so weird, we turned and left. And we went to the neighbour, where we were so nicely welcomed and there was no problem with where we could or could not sit. In that first restaurant, we discovered the joys of eating with your hands: your food is served on a banana leaf, and whatever you order is thrown on that leaf,
Portrait no 1.
People asked us to take their photos all the time. Unlike in Indonesia we didn't have to pose with them
and then the fun starts, you mix your rice with different curries, and stuff your face with the assistance of your right hand. AWESOME, I will never eat with a fork and a spoon any more 😊 (although I lied, I just ate muesli with a spoon this morning).

So, that was that for our first day in Trichy, I think all we did, was check out the bus station and the schedule for the buses for our next destination, and that was it. Oh, wait. Another thing we discovered in India: real coffee, Indian coffee, with loads and loads of REAL milk. Yum, yum.

The next day we had plenty of time, before we had to check out (in India hotels don't have a designated check out time, you rent your room for 24 hours). So we decided to at least do something in Trichy and we went to see the famous fort. Arriving to town centre with a local bus, fun, fun, fun, we stepped onto a street and were finally greeted by India. Jan was walking around saying: “I am loving it. I am taking it all in. It's crazy, but I love it!” And
Portrait no 2.
it was chaotic, but it's the kind of chaos, that is, well, endearing. People wearing colourful clothes, so many different noises, people staring at you, but never impolitely, just out of pure curiosity. Walking the gazillion stairs to the top of the fort, there were so many locals, who just wanted Jan to take a picture of them, all smiling like little children.

After experiencing the phenomenal views of the city from the fort, we went back to the hostel, picked up our stuff and went to the bus station, hoping we wouldn't have to wait long for the bus. We got there, they hauled us up to a bus and literally 5 minutes after arriving to the bus station we were on our way to Madurai.
Madurai


They told us the bus ride to Madurai should last about 4 hours, so I braced myself to spend the next 5 to 6 hours on the bus. But I was proven wrong, only 3,5 hours later we arrived to our second destination in India, Madurai. We chose a hostel from the guide book and were lucky for a change, they had room, the price was reasonable and it
Portrait no 3.
was clean. Score!!! Oh, the name of the place is Sri Devi, and we wre paying around 450rp.

Madurai is one of the oldest cities in south Asia and is known for the vast and colourful temples of Sri Meenakshi – Sundareshwarar Temple. We were actually staying just round the corner, so we took a sneak peek the first day.

The next day, looking for a good local place to get breakfast, the hotel manager suggested we go to a place called Modern Restaurant, which became our main food supplier for the next 2 days. The place was nothing special, just one of the local restaurants, but the people there were so nice, and it was always packed with locals, so that it always a good sign. We completely gave up on having normal breakfast, so we are getting into the habit of starting our day with one of the local bread substitutes (dosa, poori, parota, chapati – all so very yummy) and some curry. We would stop again at the restaurant for the mid – day meal (meals are divided into 3 parts in India, specific food available for breakfast, ready meals for lunch, and then another
Trichu - view from the temple
group of food for dinner). Mid – day meal is awesome and fun, as you get to be a bit messy again. You buy a coupon first, than sit your ass down and the procession of men bringing individual food items begins: you get your banana leaf first, then the rice man brings you rice, slam dunk, it's on your “plate”, the curry man brings 4 saucepans around, and puts a ladle of each of the sauces/curries on top of your banana leaf, then the padam man comes round, and you get one on top of your rice – unless you are Jan and are crazy about padams (tastes and looks like huge crisps) and you get 2, and another man brings you a different kind of sauce that you use to moisten your rice, and then last but not least, you get the sweets. And then you can dig in and make a huge mess and enjoy the food, which is of course eaten with your hands. 😊 You can tell I love the meals.

OK, enough of food. We went around the temples the next day, which were just amazing, so colourful, but the majority of the
Internet caffe
Batteries to allow PCs to work during many, many power cuts
action was taking place around the four towers (that are placed in a vast rectangle in the middle of the city). You can always count on masses of people gathering around the temples, there are many shops there, families sitting down on the pavements, people chatting...you could just sit down and observe. Oh, and I got my first batch of expensive jewellery there: 5 bracelets, which are changing shape every day and cost around 30rp (about 40cents) and a “wedding ring” (cheap piece of …), for 10 rp – I need to seem to be married, as I will get less attention that way, apparently. 😊

After seeing the main sight we were already looking at how to get to our next destination and we went to get some info from the main train station, where we found out, it wasn't as easy as we though. You have to wait in a long line first, to not purchase a ticket, but to get on the waiting list. Then, after you purchase the fake ticket, you are asked to come back in the evening, so thy can confirm your ticket and establish whether you can travel or not. Lucky for
Coffee, coffee, coffee
Can be found at any corner..for 7rp,
us that we are tourists, as they have some special quotas for tourists and you usually get a bed or a seat on the train. But we saw people booking 1, 2, 3 months in advance. We had the fake ticket, but then Jan found a store that sells Canon cameras, specifically dSLRs. He was really sad when our camera broke and was so thrilled with the idea that he could purchase an SLR camera and use it for the remainder of the trip. So we decided to stay in Madurai for another night (as they were expecting a camera next day. They had one SLR only), which meant, it was back to the train station for me, trying to explain we were not travelling that evening.

And some more admin followed. They can't just change the date on the ticket, so they told me, I have to fill out a cancellation form, cancel the ticket, come back the next day, fill out the reservation form, and get the “fake” ticket again. I decided to try my luck, so I filled out both forms, made sure I went to a male clerk behind the counter and played on my
Tree baskets
“damsel in distress” card. And it worked, we got the fake ticket on that same evening.

The next day was camera purchasing day. But things got a bit complicated: according to Jan's research the price was a bit high, we could not get any money from the ATM, and when we wanted to pay by card, they wanted to charge an extra 2%. Nothing went right, and Jan completely lost all will to even look at the camera. So we decided it would wait, and that our little Canon camera will have to do. I am happy with that, but Jan, the artist, is not to thrilled about the outcome. But the photos he is taking are still amazing, so I hope it will do for him.

We were pretty much just wondering around for the remainder of the day, waiting for the train (22.50 departure). When we got to the train station and located our carriage we were a bit surprised when we saw the sleeper. It was just so funny and weird, but after we climbed on the top level (you literally felt as if you were sleeping on a bunk bed in a submarine), it

was actually quite comfy and to be honest, I slept like a baby. We departed on time (shockingly) and 9 hours later, we were in Varkala.

Driving directions to Madurai is simple.Drive towards Electronic City and you are on NH7.Drive straight on NH7 - the road goes straight to Kanyakumari passing through Salem Madurai. Madurai is about 450 Kms from Bangalore it will take maximum 5.30 hours.The road is 4 lane you have to cross 7-8 tolls and shell out Rs 500 till Madurai.I was able to manage 120Km/hr till madurai with small breaks did Bangalore Madurai in 4.30 hrz.

1 hour we lost in Madurai city to find out directions for Rameshwaram.Madurai to Ramehswaram is 180 kms and its 2 lane NH in very good condition but you cant mantain the same speed you did Bangalore - madurai.Another 3 hrz to to Rameshwaram.

Rameshwaram is a small laid back temple town of religious importance- wrong, its not just the temples you will find the finest beaches here in Rameshwaram.Check out the map of Rameshwaram, 1 side its Indian Ocean other side its Bay of Bengal.You can see 2 different colors mixing into 1.1 day you can easily spend on the beach and 1 day visit temple.



You wont find any 5 star accomodation but there are 2-3 3 star decent hotels you can stay.We checked into 1

Train to Coimbatore
Soon filled up with talkative travellers to a major city, albeit completely unknown to me.
I’m writing this on the train from Kochi. Around me is a cacophony of enthusiastic conversations (men’s and women’s voices) in Indian language(s) and the faint English conversations of our group. Every few minutes tea and coffee vendors walk quickly through the car chanting, “Chai Chai Chai” or Coffee Coffee Coffee”. We are in a “second class air condition chair” car. It has been specially cleaned because a government minister is travelling on it. The interior is somewhat worn and the windows are dirty, but the seats are comfortable.

Outside pass the scenes common to our travels, although now the proportion is more towards fields and plantations and only a few villages, no doubt because of the constraints in laying tracks. (10:10 a.m.)

I am now writing in bed (with a hot water bottle at my feet to ward off the 5° chill) in Ooty, after a day of hard but exciting travel. Getting off the train in Coimbatore was adrenaline inducing. We were asked by our organizers to disembark immediately to allow room for the porters to get our cases down from the overhead racks and off the train. This was a five-minute stop. My case came off
Porters
Thankfully all our cases were taken from the train before it picked up speed!
first to my relief. Trouble was, of course, that people were trying to get on the train at the same time. Three porters struggled mightily, but the train started with the three porters and two cases still on. JK vociferously demanded the porters complete their job, while two of our group gasped in fear of losing their belongings. The slow departure speed did let the porters bundle the cases and themselves out the door.

Our new driver consulted with JK and L__, who had to announce there was no time for lunch. The train was late and traffic was bad because of Republic Day (Independence Day). L__ stopped the bus to buy oranges and bananas and cookies, and a bit later for a toilet in a hotel (very clean squat toilet). Then we battled horrendous roads – some under construction, some thoroughly deteriorated. After about an hour we were on to the new road – still rough (maybe it’s the bus springs) but much faster. We had another train to catch.

Fairly suddenly, we were rising fast into the Nilgiri mountains, completely forested or cultivated and quite high – elevation about 3000 metres in Ooty. The road was

twisty and much narrower than our roads, with cars, buses, tuktuks and motor cycles passing each other and the trucks. Ignoring the dangers required complete faith in the driver plus a studied concentration on the beauty of the vistas. The views were stunning – folds of the earth clothed in greenery and swathed in what could have been translucent mist – but which was smoky pollution all the way to the top. Very disconcerting. The most thrilling view near the top was an almost vertical hillside draped with Flamboyants in bloom! Once in a lifetime!

At Coonoor we got on a small train to climb to Ooty. Thanks to aggressive driving, we were more than half an hour early. This train didn’t seem to take luggage (maybe a separate car), and in each compartment there were eight people, almost knees touching. (The driver and bus went by road, so this train ride was an entertainment.) Once we started it was quite exciting – the views alternated cut-banks and deep, wide mountain vistas. All the windows – more like window walls – were open. We all hung out, taking pictures, most of which probably won’t turn out because of the
Train and Cows
We got underway after checking that the cows were not hurt by being bumped by the train.
speed – always a tree in focus when the camera snapped. I kept switching from video to still cameras, unable to decide which was better, until I gave up and just enjoyed the ride. There were several stations along the way, because this is a transportation method for hill residents. We contributed to pollution with chugs of black smoke, supplemented on steep grades by flames coming out of the train’s coal-fired engine. Surprising to me was the number of hill towns – only a few minutes between each.

After an hour we were in Ooty, and a five-minute drive brought us to the Savoy Hotel: 180 years old, once a school, and for 100 years a hotel. Guest cottages in rows were scattered about the grounds where by day many lawn activities were organized. We only had time for a rest before the well-served set menu dinner, which included delicious white fish, fried in butter.

Hotel 1
Travel Period - Mar to Apr 2009

Chennai, Mahabalipuram & Kancheepuram

This was my 2nd trip to India. A very short trip indeed.

We arrived in Chennai International Airport and our pre-booked vehicle was waiting for us. We had a grand welcome from the hotel (Ambica Empire) - presenting us with garlands 😊

The check-in was quick and we got settled in our room. The weather was very humid and staying in an air-con room was a neccessity. We had hired a driver to bring us around for our trip. We had lunch (typical south indian Thali) and it was absolutely delicious and cheap!

After that, we did the usual touristy stuffs:

(1) Spencer Plaza

(2) Marine Beach (super crowded)

(3) MGR memorial (both my parents were fans of his movies)

After this, we went for a bit of shopping for indian traditional clothes.

We left early the next morning for our next 2 destinations, Mahabalipuram and Kancheepuram. We will just stop by these areas as we need to reach Madurai by night fall. In Mahabalipuram, we stopped by one of the temples which had really nice hand craftings on the
hotel 2
stones. All these must have been done by the hands of some gifted scuplturer. Next, we arrived into Kancheepuram where we stopped by a store/factory and the owner showed us how Kancheepuram (famous worldwide) silk is being made. You would be expecting a big factory with big machines doin the silk but it wasnt. It was in a small room and each corner of the room were 2 machine, obviously made up of wood and the worker , an old man was doing it manually. Amazing!!

We reached Madurai at night time just time for dinner. We stayed over for a night at GRT Regency. The next morning, we made our way to the famous Meenakshi Amman Temple. This huge temple was estimated to have 33,000 sculptures in the temple. We had to pay a small sum to be nearer to the deities than the rest of the devotees (it happens in India when you are a tourist or rich). We did walked around the temple and noticed many beautifully painted sculptures.

Chennai itself was a crowded city with horns blazing its way through just like any other cities in India. The people are very warm. Although I

only spent a day or 2 in chennai and its cities, I hope to come back and spend more time on the streets and taking in the sights as well.

Ooty 1
Travel Period - Mar to Apr 2009

We arrived at Ooty just in the nick of time. Why? Its because on that day, it was ""Save The Earth Day"" and all electricity will be cut temporarily and we wouldnt have managed to check-in.

Our trip from Madurai to Ooty was a bumpy one. The roads were so narrow yet the driver skillfully managed to manuvore the vehicle well. As we were reaching higher, we could glance down and see how high we were. People with fear of heights will definately shiver at the look of it. As nighttime falls, the temperature dipped further. We had a minor accident on our way up. Another vehicle was speeding behind us and hit our car, near the bumper. There was a small fight, well just verbal one as my dad and uncle were there to back up the driver.

We checked-in and were given lots of candles to lit when the lights went off. We got a room that gave us a view of the bonfire that the hotel arranged for all the guests. We were too tired from all our travelling that we just stayed in our room.

The
Ooty 2
next morning, we had lots of sightseeing to do. We had breakfast first, variety was that great. Then did some snooping around the hotel and took pictures. We headed to the Lake where there was also a bazaar and market as well. We did some shopping and Ooty is famous for its nilgeri oil for all ailments. I managed to catch the toy train (actual train) which looked very cute.

Well, this sums up my trip to India. I must admit that this was indeed a really short trip due to my work. India, as always, as been interesting. I hope to explore other parts of India, especially the northern states and of course Taj Mahal.

Temple Ooty
So as I said last time have moved on to Ooty. Passed through two Tiger reserves on the way here, didn't see any tigers, not that I expected to as we were on the main road through the middle of it, but did see a few deer, a few dozen eagles and about four million monkeys. I also saw a jackal but that was in the car park of the guest house not in the park. There was sign at the entrance to the park telling drivers not to blow thier horns so as not to scare the animals. That was one big waste of a sign. Horn blowing while driving is like some form of tourettes here and no amount of signs is going to change that.

Ooty's nice and warm in the day but can get very chilly even cold at night. Despite this nowhere seems to have any heating so in the restaurants at night everyone is sat there in thier hats and coats. Ooty town itself is ok but nothing special. Like most places Iv'e seen in India there seems to have been very little thought put into town planning/building. So Ooty sits like some grubby
Sugar Cane sellers
little scar of concreate boxes and open sewers surrounded by fantastic countryside. All rolling hills, tea plantations and mist cloaked forest. Its a shame really you just have the feeling it could be so much better.

I spent most of my time there out of town and up in the hills which was fantastic except i need a better set of legs.

Apparently it used to be called ""snooty Ooty"" back durring the days of British rule as all the rich colonials used to decamp up here when it got to hot down on the plains.

It was the festival of Pongal while I was there which from what I could gather is a sort of harvest festival. All the cows were spruced up to look their best with a quick wash and painted horns. Sugar cane seemed to be big on the menu with everyone taking bags of it home and some places hanging it outside. The cleaning ladies at the guest house all drew designs outside the door which I took a rather rubbish picture of. Out of Ooty I saw a few elephants also all done up in their finery which would have made
Pongal Pictures
a nice picture but I was tearing by at break neck speed on a bus at the time.

So all in all Ooty town I could take or leave but the surrounding countryside is great for walking and if you've got a wooly hat the climate is perfect. And if you do make it here kabab korner is great for tandoori of any kind.

Said at the begining that i was now in Ooty which I was when I started writing this but have now moved on again and arrived yesterday in Fort Cochin in Kerala which at first look is just my sort of place. More about that next time.

Birthday Dawn
For a January baby, this is bliss!
My birthday surprise was sitting in the private outdoor shower at 6:15 a.m., enjoying the pre-dawn calls of birds. Then, on the front veranda of my chalet, the chorus diminished as the deep orange sun rose directly in my view east, through pink and blue tinged clouds over the Bay of Bengal. The surf pounded strongly giving a constant auditory sense of heavy rain, although the day is fine and the temperature is suited to sitting outside.

Birthday celebrations continued through lunch. At breakfast our fellow travellers wished me Happy Birthday, as did a German woman who overheard them, and also my special chef (sous-chef he murmured once). Suffering mightily from allergic reaction to the perfume in my room, I went outside to the fresher air on the veranda for breakfast, where L__ joined me, as eventually did V__. After I had already consumed fruit bread and omelet, my chef came around greeting guests and offered to make me another dish. Too flattered to refuse, I happily consumed a delicious dosa with turmeric-coloured potato salad, white coconut sauce and green coriander sauce - the colours of the Indian flag.

The bus took us to Mahabalipuram, affording views
Krishna's Butter Ball
All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't move Krisha.
of morning life in the villages: women walking in colourful saris, men enjoying breakfast, shop keepers of both genders opening up for the day.

At the archeological park, we first stopped at a rock called “Buddha’s Butter Ball”, a gigantic round rock perched in what looks like a precarious manner on a hill of rock; however, even when they had put all the soldiers around to the task, the colonial British had failed to move it. At the end of a short walk along on to the granite hill, we viewed carvings of the gods in what was called a cave, although it was more a depression in the rock. As with yesterday, several of the main and most intricately carved gods, such as Shiva and Parvati, were in niches, with small amounts of vegetable dye still visible.

Our next visit was at a marvelous high relief carving, the largest after Anchor Wat, according to the guide. The story of the long penance of Arjuna was portrayed with numerous gods represented as animals supporting him in the jungles of the Himalayas. Large elephants dominated the foreground, and Shiva towered over the emaciated Arjuna, who stood on one leg without food

or water for more than a decade.

Next we visited the five “chariots”, one for each of the five brothers in Mahabarata – oddly the brothers don’t seem to be portrayed at all. Each small temple is dedicated to a god, usually Shiva and Parvati again of course. Also in this complex of temples were beautiful carvings of a relaxed lion, elephant and bull – the last much beyond life size.

In all these temples there were lots of Indian families enjoying the Pongal festival/holiday, which has now extended four days. Women were wearing bright saris, many gold-bordered and figured. No one minds if we take their photos, and quite a few ask us to, even though they will never see the pictures except on the screen of the camera. Some had camera phones and asked for our photos. (This happened a little in Chennai also – very friendly and happy to see tourists.) As the day went on, the crowds grew, and on our way back to the hotel we saw that the police had erected barriers against cars and were also controlling the massive foot traffic.

Our final temple was the Shore Temple on the coast
Varaha Temple

of the Bay of Bengal. The whole park and all along the coast were devastated by the 2004 Christmas Day Tsunami, but all is now restored and the people are better off, according to the guide, with their new houses and boats. Although the Shore Temple is an archeological site, as were the others today, some people treated the altars as active places of worship. Most people just tramped around looking at the intricate carvings.

The temple complex has been eroding through the centuries, with apparent old attempts at control, pre-dating concrete. None of these temples have the carved towers of more recent temples, but each of the three sections has a sacred centre with a carving to be worshiped: a reclining Vishnu and two Shivas.

Now was time for a little shopping. We stopped for a few minutes to look at a shop that sold mass-market replica stone carvings. Our real destination was a small shop kept by a master carver where he sells the work of his students. These intricate carvings of Shiva, Parvati and Ganesha, and many more were done in the round, not with unfinished, flat backs as in the first store.

Lunch was at a

beachside resort under a festival tent. I bought wine and beer for all to celebrate the day (about $36 or 1726 rupees for ten people). Three of us shared a bottle of Indian Sauvignon Blanc. The buffet lunch was good, with lots of variety, but we had been spoiled by some previous spectacular buffet meals. We rounded off the experience by shopping in a nearby clothing store, where I bought a pajama (loose pants) for 200 rupees ($4) to relax in hotel rooms.

Which is what I did upon returning to the hotel. I was quite tired, as I haven’t been sleeping well because of being sensitive to the scents they use for “refreshing” the room. With front door and door to the shower open to air the room, I lounged outside on the swinging bed with the remainder of Sharpe’s Trafalgar to read (didn’t quite finish it). When the sun got too hot I went to the very large free-form pool and swam all the way round a few times, lounging in-between. Surprisingly, with the pool and deck in the shade and an onshore breeze, I was too cold and had to return to my room.
Village by Shore Temple
Who wouldn't be jealous of such a colourful new village!
This did give me time to pack for tomorrow.

As a surprise after dinner, the chef brought out a birthday cake; I blew out a couple of candles and cut the first piece. By now even the wait staff knew I couldn’t eat the cream-filled cake. And, the surprise was thin because L__ had to reveal the secret at lunchtime when the waiter tried to get me to order a cake then. A card signed by all was indeed a nice surprise. A memorable day.

Leaving Chennai
Love the vivid colours and wild juxtapositions!
We left Chennai in good time, about 9:00, to drive for about two hours on bumpy roads with occasional smooth interludes. As we drove out of the city, we saw many private universities and hospitals, most specializing in one or a few disciplines. Most were examples of the newest and boldest buildings in the city; they were set amongst innumerable squat, cement buildings. Fairly often a temple, some small some large, would appear amongst the jumble and, occasionally they were also gateways into the commercial-looking compounds of gurus.

Gradually the view became more rural, although never unpopulated. Villages seemed to be accumulations of buildings with a few vendors and shops. Large, modern, and multi-storied buildings in compounds indicated the landlord’s home. Because of the Pongal holiday, no one was working in the fields. Often women were wearing red saris in celebration, and sometimes men were wearing red shirts.

As predicted, the roads were bumpy and slow to travel. For a while the highway was just rather rough. Then the road was deteriorated asphalt – inches-deep ruts on the sides, potholes, and broken pavement. Thus we came to Kanchipuram, home of the best silk weavers and best sari collections. Along

the street for about a kilometre or more were open-fronted shops spilling colourful saris and fabrics for men’s clothes. Vendors flapped open the tightly folded cloths for customers to examine. Ranks of parked motorbikes (or two-wheelers as they are called here) hemmed in customers and vendors alike.

Our stop brought us to an indoor store, Sri Varadha Silk House. On the nearest counter were heaps of silk scarves. I asked immediately about the saris and was ushered over to another counter. Before leaving Calgary I had used paint-tint-cards from Home Depot as samples to decide on a tangerine orange and mahogany wine red for curtains/drapes in the living room and dining room, so I was able to be quite specific in my choices – so specific that the seller asked me to come round the counter to point at exactly the ones I wanted to see. The orange one was easy to pick but the dark red was harder. The first I thought would do was truly expensive, so he pulled another that I actually preferred because the gold was in a leaf pattern, not polka-dots. The saris are folded tightly in a standard shape about 8”x12” – incredible

since they are 48”x6 metres. As small “packets”, about two dozen were neatly stacked on each shelf. One of my saris included an additional metre for the blouse and one did not. Our country guide, JK, was concerned and was chiding the seller and warning me. I leaned over the counter to advise him sotte voce that I was going to make drapes. He visibly brightened and said that gave him an idea, because his wife had 250 saris and wore none!

Then commenced the bargaining. We got partway through, with me having trouble figuring the dollar equivalent – shouldn’t have been difficult, because there are about 50 rupees to the dollar. That’s what stress does for you! As I learned in my lessons in negotiating, I deflected by going to the scarf pile to add to my purchases. The seller actually came over and said they were waiting for me! I maintained my semi-indifference, curtailed my usual desire to give in too soon, and got them all for a price that made the storeowner a bit annoyed – must be right! From over 12,000 rupees down to 9500 rupees ($190), below which he would not go. A happy

time!

On to the real event of the day, the Sri Ekambareswarar Temple, an overwhelming structure. The temple tower rises so far into the sky that you have to bend backwards to see it. Outside the entrance we deposited our shoes at a shop that sold a variety of small items and also provided this shoe service. Throughout this large temple were many large carvings of Shiva and his many attributes. At one side shrine, after a donation, a “guru” blessed us with sandal wood paste. Around the perimeter were 1080 (magic number) Shiva lingams.

Our next visit was to the small Makshi Temple on what seemed to be a small side street. We removed our shoes in the bus and walk along the street with a fair number of celebrants. Again, the women were glowing in their red saris decorated with gold borders. Several stalls were doing a brisk business selling souvenirs and objects or fruit to be used as offerings for worship. The temple itself was small and we didn’t go inside, just walked around the courtyard. Most exciting was the decorated elephant near the gate. It was very tame but generated lots of laughter and giggles

In fairly short order we were back on the bus, feeling rather hot and dusty. Nevertheless, on to the next temple! Kailasanatha Temple is now an archeological site, dating from the eighth century in the Pallava dynasty. The sandstone has worn down, although there is one section showing how hundreds of years ago a restoration was done, surviving as a blackened surface on the old sandstone. Current restorations are underway using a slightly lighter coloured stone to show where the new supplements the old. The meditation niches preserved the lively carvings of Shiva very well, one with a bit of paint left, indicating that we are seeing much less than once was. Few people were visiting this temple, letting the peace settle into me, and giving us a very close look at the intricate designs and carvings.

Finally we had a short stop to see a master weaver at work on a gold-bordered sari. The gold is around a silk core, providing a thread that is woven into the fabric itself. Weaving is a highly skilled craft, and this weaver worked in a space just big enough for the loom and himself.
Sacred Elephant
At Makshi Temple this well-cared-for elephant delighted all of us.
Of course, because of the holiday, almost no one else was at work.

Another couple of hours on the bus brought us to the fabulous resort of Fisherman’s Cove. Each person has a spacious chalet with a veranda furnished by table, chairs, and swinging daybed, and a private outdoor “rain” shower. Within my view, the surf of the Bay of Bengal pounded a hypnotic rhythm. After a rest, I did dabble in the waves, pursued in a desultory manner by a single vendor of souvenirs. But my swimming was in the pool because the sea flag was red.

Unfortunately I have a horrible and severe allergic reaction to the cleaning products and warm oil mosquito repellant used in the chalet. Even leaving the doors open to the clear air inside is almost futile.

For some pleasant yet unidentified reason, one of the chefs showed me particular favour this evening. He was most solicitous of my dairy-free diet and thus made my visit very personal. He asked if I wanted him to make a special dish for dinner, to which I said yes, of course. It was one of the best chicken dishes I have ever eaten, but I have no

Kapaleeshwarar Temple
We started late this morning, thank goodness. Breakfast was a plentiful buffet with many Indian and Western choices. I had a peppery Indian bean stew with bacon and toast, and papaya and a fingerling banana.

Our tour took us first to the Kapaleeshwarar Temple. Our first experience of removing our shoes and putting on the “spare” socks we were advised to bring. We entered the temple complex, which was dominated by a huge Hindu temple tower. This is a flat-sided, sugar-loaf shape, covered with fabulous, painted carvings of the Hindu gods, particularly those related to Shiva (as this is South India). Several other smaller roofs were similarly covered with carvings. We walked the short distance to one of these, the wedding hall - basically a large veranda-type place where the wedding party would congregate. We walked around the main temple, as did many others because this was the Festival of the Sun, a Hindu holiday long-weekend. (Pongal Festival) On one side was a corral for about eight cinnamon-coloured cows. One of the worship areas (no photos allowed) was dedicated to the nine planets, so there were nine statues about eighteen inches tall arranged inside a kiosk. The worshippers walked around it three times:

once for self, once for family, once for community. We walked around it once. The main worship area was virtually hidden by a line of people waiting to do their devotions; this area was forbidden to non-Hindus.

Back on the bus, we drove through the streets, which were not too full because of the holiday. Everyone was wearing their best clothes. Women were very attractive in their deeply dyed, gold-edged saris. Many children had clothes made of silk and gold sari fabric. Flower-sellers made more colour on the streets with their yellow and red carnations.

The bus drove along Marina Beach, 13 km long and apparently the second longest in the world. Lots of people were walking along in their bright clothes. We passed through the Fort St George area where the British enclave was. And arrived at San Tome, or the St Thomas Basilica, which is reputed to be built over the remains of Thomas the Apostle, although our professor says scholars dispute this. Nevertheless, we went down into the museum and crypt for St Thomas – where they were about to celebrate First Communion for a girl. We were allowed to view the special St Thomas cross, and they waited for us.
Shakti peacock


Upstairs and out again, we walked around the pure white neo-Gothic church shining beautiful in the sun. Since this was Sunday a service was underway, with the most melodious congregational singing.

Back on the bus we returned to Fort George and the Fort Museum, which is a three storey stone building with the galleries around a long atrium. It now houses an impressive collection of Chola dynasty carvings of Shiva and the associated gods, such as Parvati, his wife, and Ganesha, her son. (Ganesha in part represents that all humans and animals are part of the same spirit.) With endless repetition, I am beginning to identify some gods by their symbols. This is made more difficult by each one having several symbols and a number of avatars. Shiva is associated with snakes, particularly cobra. The museum also has a number of lingams, of which we will see many more tomorrow.

Lunch was in an ultra-modern, large restaurant with an excellent buffet featuring a wide variety of Indian foods both vegetarian and non, a few Chinese dishes and a few Western. Attentive and friendly waiters served the soup and appetizers. Although some people really liked the “Indian bread”,

I didn’t as it had little flavour and a heavy texture. I saw them making it by drizzling concentric rings of dough on to a griddle to shape a five-inch flat bread.



Returning to the hotel, V___ offered to include anyone who wanted in his walk around town. D___ and I were enthusiastic, although the others wanted to nap. The walk was longer than I expected, from 3:00 – 5:30. At first V___ was in search of two shopping malls. The very near one was Spencer Mall, which was a bit dim inside with a fair number of customers for the sari, jewelry and clothing stores. I stopped to look at some scarves, was lured in and successfully bargained for a lovely pale turquoise and pink shawl, down from 2000 rupees (ridiculous) to 400 - he would not go lower. Now V___ was interested in finding Express Avenue, for which he received contradictory directions. I was struck by how easy it is for him to approach men in the street and quickly ask and move on. With minimal retracing of our steps, crossing a huge intersection without being run over (there were lights, which helped), and avoiding being
San Tome Basilica
run down by speeding tuktuks on the side streets, we discovered the big new mall, which is not on Express Avenue but which is named Express Avenue.

Lots of young men and women and families were strolling in the mall, enjoying the holiday. Some of the stores were American or European chains, such as Levis. This didn’t interest us. As we left the mall, D___ somehow struck up a conversation with a doctor and his son, who wanted their photo taken on the son’s iPhone. Photos and extended greetings all around.

Now V___ wanted us to go Marina Beach, which required a tuktuk ride. He speaks Hindi and quickly arranged for us to squeeze into the passenger seat of a three-wheeled transport scooter with a yellow-cab canopy and body. We rushed through the traffic of cars, tuktuks, motorbikes, and buses. Hard to believe I was actually taking such a risk and enjoying the company that enabled a behaviour both bizarre (to me) and common (to Indians).

At our destination of the Gandhi monument, we took photos and walked out onto the sand – maybe about 400-500 yards across. Many vendors of ice cream, kid’s rides, balloons, and other seaside
Pongal kolam
Chalk designs seen in public and home places
amusements were doing a desultory business. The beach wasn’t as crowded as I expected. We walked up to some long, narrow fishing boats with their wooden anchors stowed – possibly drag anchors. For the most part, people pursued their own interests and left us to pursue ours.

Now V___ wanted to go to San Thome Basilica again, which we could see in the distance. Like many churches, its tall spire disappeared as we came closer. We walked for about twenty minutes. All directions from passers-by encouraged us to continue straight on, until we recognized the school attached to and across the street from the basilica. This time we could go inside because there was no service on yet. Folk art carved panels depicting the life of Jesus reminded me of the church of the Black Christ in Panama. The church was more brightly lit than any I had ever seen, and it had a relatively simple nave.

Finally we took another tuktuk to the hotel, which was farther away than any of us thought. Now 6:00, there was just time for a brief swim in the deep dusk in an ultra-long outdoor pool. The buffet dinner was extensive with many Indian
Gandhi memorial, Marina Beach
vegetarian and non-veg dishes. I fell for the mutton curry – very tender meat and well flavoured.

Railway Museum
I have now left Mysore where I had a great time. Its my favorite city so far.

While there I visited the railway museum which my guide book said was very interesting and well worth half a day. I'd say it was a little bit interesting and well worth half an hour. Never trust the books.

Also had time at the Maharajas palace which was very interesting. Its a little bit of a walk from the gate where you pay to go in and entrance to the palace. Security is quite tight and before they let me in they put my bag through an x-ray machine saw the camera in there, no photography is allowed inside, and I was pulled to one side and told to go back to the main gate and drop it off at a locker. I gave the guard my best ""you've got to be joking look"" slipped him ten rupees with a promise to leave it in my bag and I was in. Once inside I was confronted with a thousand other visiters all snapping away merrily right in front of the guides who took not a blind bit of notice. I bet it
Railway Museum
didn't cost them all ten rupees.

The palace is huge and only part of it is open to the public which is a good job or it would take all day to get round. Its all a bit over the top as far as decoration goes but was well worth the vist.

Had a very nice day out at Mysore zoo. I've been to a lot of very badly run poor zoos in asia but this was a very good one. More monkeys on the outside of the cages as inside.

After a few more days of general wandering I booked a mini bus from Mysore up to Ooty in the Nilgiri hills. It was an early start of what turned out to be a not very good day. I was the first pick up but was assured it would only take 20 minutes to pick up everybody else. It took 2 hours which put me in a bit of a grumpy mood as it wasn't a very comfortable bus. The driver was a lunatic who kept trying to overtake when there was clearly no chance of making it. After a few near death experiances I felt
Mysore Palace
the need to let him know that if he tried to kill me again we'd be having more that a few words.

It was meant to be a direct trip of about four hours but an hour after leaving Mysore we stopped for breakfast, then stopped again to look at some goats then only a few miles from our destination we stopped again for an hour at a lake so everyone could go for a boat ride. I was not best pleased and had a right moan at the bloke in charge. I think the idea was that we'd all get bored and take an auto rickshaw the last few miles into town but stuborness had taken over so I sat it out. Finanly we left for the last little bit of the journey and got within less that a mile of our drop off point when we stopped for lunch!! At this point I went into a purple headed rage which wasn't helped when I was told it was only a five minute walk to where I wanted to be which begged the question why didn,t you drop me off first. As i was close to getting chucked
Temple at Mysore Palace
off the bus anyway I gave up and walked the last bit. So my four hour day had turned into an eight day and I had turned into a miserable old bugger. Oh well I suppose they can't all be good days.

Only been in Ooty for a day so nothing to tell you yet except it gets very cold at night due to the alltitude and I've had to dig my jumper out of the bag for the first time this trip.

Not sure yet where I'm going next but will let you all know when I get there.

Dancing Nataraja
The Dancing Nataraja is an important symbol of India. This statue is in the hotel lobby.
Our 24 hours plus of airports and airplanes wasn’t so bad – I forced myself into a kind of sleep after dinner on the way to Frankfurt. On the way to Chennai I had several genuine naps, interspersed with looking out the window. The sky was clear over most of the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea. As we went over the Caucasus Mountainsby the Caspian, I finally disturbed my seatmate to get at my camera in the overhead compartment. Just caught the end of the snow capped ridges as the sun set. The pattern of weather was obviously from the northwest as most of the snow was on that side of the mountains in a scene of white and greeny-gray, deepening as the sun set into an orange rim.

The night was deeply black when we arrived in Chennai at about a quarter to midnight. After waiting in the long lineup at immigration and then collecting our luggage, we stepped out into florescent-lit darkness, punctuated by the many horns of the many cars meeting the many passengers. After a few minutes, we walked through the chaos understood only by the Indians to our full-size bus, which drove into the fairly quiet streets of Chennai. First impressions were of lots of one-to-three-storey concrete buildings, all shuttered for the night. I was surprised that there was no unusual smell to the air as there is in Africa.

Our hotel (Vivanta by Taj Connemara) greeted us with garlands and juice. Lovely honey-coloured marble and modern rooms. To bed about 2:30 a.m.

Look out Dad
The tour guide moves in for the kill...
Namaskaram!!



Re-visiting Kerala was, for lack of better descriptors (can someone please forward me some new adjectives other than amazing and incredible? I use these words far too often when I blog!), amazing and comforting. As I mentioned in the last posting, Kerala is really home-y to me and it was nice going back to a couple places that I had been before and sharing them with Mom. We went immediately from Kannur to Fort Cochin, an old colonial-ish town on the coast that I went to once when I was here last time. It's pretty un-India in that there is less traffic and noise than usual and there are lots of old churches and Dutch and Portugese buildings instead of temples. I left Mom to sightsee on her own for the first day since I had pretty much seen everything and I took the day to work on a correspondence course that I'm taking while here (this was a terrible idea on my part – but one that I am resignedly sticking to!). The following day we went on a backwaters boat tour to see some of the countryside that Kerala is famous for.


Toddy!
""Don't worry, it tastes better than it smells!""

The tour was admittedly touristy, but we had a great guide who was really funny and kept hitting on my mom all day – and I kept telling him that I was going to tell my dad about it but the guide just laughed. He is also apparently an Ayurvedic (traditional Indian medicine) doctor so he was taking everyone's pulse and telling them about their health. We took a boat and cruised around the backwaters, these long, interconnecting rivers that function as watery highways that people still use for commerce and for getting around in the remote parts of the state. We also got to drink toddy, which is a local moonshine brew made from the sap of coconut flowers, and smells really bad but tastes good! It ferments throughout the day so that at night when I went to have a little nightcap I loosened the lid of my bottle, the cap shot off and hit the ceiling of my room! I ended up not drinking the rest...



Then came the part of this trip that I have been most looking forward to – visiting Thiruvalla, the village where I volunteered the first time I came
Backwaters
Beauty.
to India, and Santha, my “Indian Mum”, who is hands-down the strongest woman I know. Those of you who read my blogs from last time I was here will know the story (hahaha but you can always go back and re-read it if you need refreshing!), but the short version of it is that Santha is married to an abusive husband but can't get out of the marriage and in trying to help other women and serve as an example she is working for the women's organization, Sevika Sanghom, that I volunteered with last time I was here.



The whole train ride to Thiruvalla my stomach was doing flips, partly because I was excited but also partly that Santha had only gotten the email that we were coming the day before and I didn't want to be a burden on her or interrupt her weekend. The second we saw each other on the train platform though, we broke out into huge smiles and ran towards each other, me dropping my bags all over the place, and just gave each other the hugest hugs, laughing and crying at the same time. It was amazing to me that, 2

Reunited with Santha!
years (almost to the day) that I had first arrived in Thiruvalla and met Santha, I was able to come back and visit her again. It also meant the world to me that I was able to introduce my mom and Santha to each other, both of my Moms, living half a world away from each other. It turned out that she had declined going to her cousin's wedding and picking her husband (who is a monster) up from the hospital so that she could come meet our train, but it didn't matter to her because, in her words, “It feels like my daughter is coming home”. Yup, the tears were really going at that point!



We spent the afternoon visiting and getting caught up on all of our news – she showed me pictures of her new granddaughter, I showed her photos of my family, we went for lunch and tea, and we visited a bunch of the places I worked at, in particular the old age home where, astonishingly, a few of the older ladies remembered me and even knew my NAME (I basically did not stop crying the entire time I was there hahaha!!),
Varkala
Let's talk about how painful it was to walk back UP the cliff after a day in 40-degree heat!!
and visiting the home for special-needs girls where I worked, as well as the girls' orphanage. I was really excited to hear that some of the girls are off doing higher education, one of them, Asha, is at school for fashion design and another, Manju, is at teacher training school, and it made me so happy to know that they are getting the chance to do what they might not have been able to do if they hadn't come into the organization.



Mom and I stayed at the volunteers' flat and cooked a delicious dinner (well I cooked) of dhal, chappati, bhindi masala and kozhukattai (which is a rice dumpling stuffed with coconut and jaggery and I am sure I have mentioned it before because it is pretty much the best dessert I have ever had), and Santha complimented me on my cooking and how good it was which made me happy since she was the one who taught me and it was good to know that I still remember everything! It was a really short visit, just overnight, but it was still so special. It felt amazing to go back and visit the vegetable market, the

temple, even just the internet cafe, the places that were a part of my daily life for 2 months while I was going through a period of really intense personal growth and exploration, and being in Thiruvalla brought back so many happy memories of learning how to do the simple things, like laundry by hand every night and cooking from scratch every evening and getting water from the well and all these things that I had to do while I lived there that I had never done before, but that taught me a lot of patience (ahem, a trait that I am still working on and probably still will be working on for the rest of my life!). Seeing Santha was also really special, this woman who is my role-model and someone whose spirit is so strong and so unable to be dominated by her horrific husband, who unfortunately she is still living with but who still continues to threaten to kill her and who continues to have affairs with other women, right in the house. She has not and will not stop fighting against the hand that she was dealt in life and it was so comforting to see
Kanyakumari
Most beautiful sunrise, ever.
that, 2 years later, she is still dreaming big about starting up a little farm and community for women where they can escape and live in peace away from abusive marriages.

After visiting Thiruvalla we went to Varkala, a reeeeeeeeeeally touristy beach resort that, again, I had already been to but that was awesome to see again. Our room had a big balcony with a hammock (Pashu, if you are reading this one, the hammock was much MUCH stronger than that in Kudle (plus I was in it by myself) so it didn't break, but even if it had there was a railing on the balcony so I couldn't have fallen off) and a BATHTUB, which I hadn't even seen since I left Canada, and I was reminded and thankful again for the perks of travelling with Mom, who I have decided is no longer allowed to go out shopping on her own because she has no bargaining skills whatsoever and paid way too much money for a purse and shirt. So now shopping is supervised 😊 . We spent the majority of our time in Varkala on the beach with a nice couple we'd met in Fort Cochin
Sabarimala friends!
They loved Mom!
on the boat tour, Barry and Kelly, who were hilarious, doing a lot of swimming and reading and walking on the beach, and of course having one terrifically epic dance party that featured a middle aged Indian guy doing the splits on the dance floor! It was a very relaxing 2 days but I was getting antsy eating non-spicy food (one of the downers of hanging around in major tourist hotspots) and so we left for Kanyakumari after 3 days.



Kanyakumari is on the tip of India, where the Arabian Sea, Indian Ocean, and Bay of Bengal all meet and where a ton of spiritual stuff has happened, making it both a pilgrimmage spot and a tourist destination for Indians. It was a weird blend of this very holy temple to the goddess Devi Kumari, who from what I gather was a virgin who seduced Shiva by dancing or something like that (I may be getting this mixed up with Meenakshi, whose temple in Madurai we visited yesterday, who was born with 3 breasts but an astrologer told her father that upon meeting her husband the 3rd breast would disappear; she fought a big war against Shiva's
The usual.
These kids were actually REALLY sweet, but we realized that if we stood in one place for too long we risked never being able to leave due to the sheer number of pictures being taken!
army in the north of India and when Shiva himself came down to see who this goddess was who had beaten back all of his soldiers, her 3rd breast disappeared and they got married), mixed with a bunch of souvenir shops selling mobiles made out of shells that really could have been equally as at home in south Florida. I loved it though, there was something really powerful about being at the end of the country, looking out at the sun rising in the east, with absolutely nothing but open, wildly crashing ocean before you (I'm sure no one will be surprised when I said it brought tears to my eyes, followed quickly by lots of laughter as about 35 people wanted to take their photos individually with me). We also went out to the Devi temple on the ocean, where her footsteps from her dance are said to be, and I can honestly say that there was something REALLY moving about that place, too – when I visited the Mount of Olives in Jerusalem and the spot where Jesus was said to have ascended into heaven, I felt some really powerful energy there too and it was similar to
Pretty wind turbines!
Am I a total loser if I find wind turbines beautiful? Hahahahaha!
what I felt at the temple in Kanyakumari – whether or not a goddess really did dance there and whether or not there really was a Jesus who went up into heaven, I can't say, but I do know that I was hit with the same feeling of the place being really, really sacred and special.



We went by train to Madurai, where there is, as I mentioned above, a huge and gorgeous temple to the goddess Meenakshi and the god Shiva, and it is on this train that I saw thousands upon thousands of wind turbines, looking like big white birds spinning in the sky, and that made me so happy, and also made the single. lone wind turbing at Toronto's waterfront look pathetic by comparison! As usual the train was a full-sensory experience. South India in particular is absolutely gorgeous, with the palms, rice paddies, mountains in the distance, and it is just so lush and verdant and fertile that it fills you up with so much positive energy. Travelling by train right now is also a unique experience due to the sheer number of pilgrims going to Sabarimala, which is a holy place in
Madurai gopura
The unbelievably intricate and gorgeous statues on the entranceway to the Madurai temple.
Kerala that is worshipped by devotees of Ayappa, the son of, incidentally, a gay union between Shiva and Vishnu (well, sort of – the gods wanted to test Shiva to see how good he was at resisting temptation, so Vishnu got all dressed up like a beautiful woman and went to seduce Shiva. The plan backfired though, because apparently Shiva is NOT good at resisting temptation, and a son was born of their get-together, Ayappa) (please also note that my re-telling of the Hindu stories, legends and history is approximate and subject to my own interpretation of things – I told the story of Kali to Chris, a British friend of mine who really IS well-versed in Hindu philosophy, and he burst out laughing at what I had come up with). Sabarimala time sees millions of men dressed in black, barefoot and carrying packs of food, clothes and blankets on their heads, walking and taking the train to the temple that apparently gets almost as many visitors as Mecca!



So the trains are crowded but no less fun and intense, the food is still as spicy as ever and we are leaving tomorrow for Mumbai, where I
Dance off!
My favourite statues in the Madurai temple for sure: Shiva and Meenakshi having a dance-off!
fully intend on finding a role in Bollywood that is a step up from my last role in a commercial with Deepika Padukone and where my mom can make a little pilgrimmage of her own to some of the places mentioned in the book Son of the Circus by John Irving (another excellent read).



Spicy love from Hindustan!



XO Shannon



p.s. I have had numerous hilarious exchanges with rickshaw drivers wanting to take us to a place where they get a cut from bringing business to a hotel. It is of course frustrating, but always makes me laugh because of the absurdity of conversations I wind up having. A typical exchange with a commission-seeking rickshaw driver looks like this:



Me: “We would like to go to the New College Guesthouse”



Driver: “Sree Devi Guesthouse?”



Me: “No, New College Guesthouse.”



Driver: “OK, Sree Devi Guesthouse.”



Me: “No, we want to go to New College Guesthouse. No Sree Devi.”



Driver: “Madam, Sree Devi Guesthouse is very good price. We go there.”



Me: sigh....

I realised that I have to hurry up a little bit because my friend Sepp from Kiel wants to visit me in Chennai in about 3 weeks, and if I want to fulfill my plan of going to the very South of Inida it are still 1500km.

Because the days in India are quite short also the distances I make are not so big. Before India it was no problem to ride more than 100km a day. But here I havent made more than 100km in one day except the one day without luggage where I took my MP3 player. After the night at the beach in Goa I decided to make 100km again. And I made it. I was going to the Cotiago Sanctuary in the South of Goa. And it was really nice. I havent seen any leopard or so but it was an awesome silence and nice jungle I was wandering in. So on 31.12. I already was leaving Goa again. Since the alcohol is so cheap in Goa that I bought a bottle of Cashew schnapps. I realised that after the last puncture I have lost my air pump. I couldnt believe it, how could I
DSCF3180
lose my air pump? So I bought in the next town a new pump. It is a really big one! But it is working very fine.

My battery of my bordcomputer was quite empty at least it said so. I changed the battery and it isnt working at all anymore. But dont worry, the stop watch is still working so I can stop my daily riding time. And the distances I estimate by my maps and the road signs. So you still can enjoy my statistics 😊

New years eve I was celebrating with the schnapps and mango nectar. I was awakened by loud biting aunts in the entry of my tent. Unbelievable that they were so loud. But luckily, my tent was closed and they couldnt come into my tent.

In Karnataka, the next state after Goa I just cycled through. Although I was on a National Highway the road was often very bad. And the more I was coming to the South the more noise was on the street. I was often listening to music so it was a bit better. Here the mosquitos are also much more present than in the first days in
DSCF3186
wildlife sanctuary in Goa
Maharashtra. I was surprised to have no problems with mosquitos there but now I have to hurry up every evening to build up my tent to flee away from them. However, n the tent is it often very hot and I am sweatening a lot. I start sleeping without any sleeping bag but during the night it is getting colder so that I have to crawl into it.

Some news of my companions: Bert from US cycled in Israel Jordan, Egypt , Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand (with some flights in between) and is now back at home. Chris and Meint made it from Teheran over Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan to Kashgar in China with the cycle. But for both it was too cold and Chris took the train to Beijing and Meint was flying to Nepal where he spent a month as backpacker. I think Chris is continuing to Australia as far as possible with bicycle.

After three days I came into Kerala. Again a different language, different people. The men are often wearing wrap-around skirts. You see again many mosques and women in black clothes. Even the letters are completely different from the devangari alphabet. So I have agaion
DSCF3187
no idea what is written on the signs. I often must think of Europe, also with a unique currency and no passport controls at the borders, but different cultures, different languages, different countries.

I got again many spots as in Serbia for example, I thinkl it is from the heat and the effort. But they have gone again after a few days.

Sometimes I made a rest at a beach. Very nice beaches, often without any person there! But in general it is very crowded along the coast in Kerala. My RoughGuide says it is the most denelky populated region in hole India. And I feel it! There is no place where you can be alone for a few minutes. And then the horrible noise of the crazy honking of everybody. I have no problems with the smell, the chaos, the litter, the heat, mosquitos,... but the noise I cant get used to it. In the evening I had many problems to get a sleeping place. The towns or villages or whatever along the road didnt stop. I was happy when I found a green area in the middle of a town where I could stay. And it
DSCF3191
high view point
is funny that in such places I was mostly not disturbed the whole evening, night and morning, although all people could see me.

In the middle of Kerala at the coiast there is a little enclave, Mahe, belonging to Puducherry, another very little state. There were many alcohol shops so that I allowed myself a bottle of wine. That night I stayed at a beach. Some locals came and stared at me without saying something or made some fancy movements with their hands that I didnt understand. I thought the one guy wanted to have some food of me. After a while a bigger group came to me and one said to me that there are often snakes. Everywhere snakes! Even at the beach. They showed me a place where no snakes can come to. I tried exceptionally to sleep without a tent but that was a fault. The mosquitos annoyed me muchso I couldnt sleep. At one o'clock or so the police came, wanted to see my passport and was asking what I am doing there. Thei said it was not so safe there, that there are some thieves. I nevertheless wanted to stay there and they said,
DSCF3193
okay but dont complain tomorrow at the police. No problems with any thieves but many problems with the mosquitos!

One evening when I couldnt find a sleeping place I was riding in the night. Was not so bad as I thought and it was quite nice not to have the hot sun. But that was the only evening I did this, else I ride only in the daylight.

Some days it was really hot, it reminded me to the hot days in Turkey. I just went from one juice shop to the next and tried nice fruit juices and shakes and ice creams😊

In Kottayam I decided to go directly to Tamil Nadu and not make the longer way to Trivandrum and then backj to Chennai. The time was getting too close. I had to cross the ghats I was making 1000m elevation in one day. I dont know if I had such steep mountains so far. There were tea plantages everywhere where I also decided to sleep. I thought there was a nice meadow but suddenly my feet were completely sunk in mud. Nice! But I found a dry place to stay. In the night it
DSCF3195
was extremely raining. Once a guy came and said something like Buga, buga, beega, Caruba! Probably Malayam, the language spoken in Kerala. I said ""sleep, sleep""and made the corresponding handsign. ""Buga, Baruga!"" I answered the same and he was going away. And for this conversation I had to open my tent, that everything got wet! After a while the same game with another person. But then they let me alone. The next morning I was awakened buy one of the guys at 7am and he showed with hand signs that I should not stay there. He showed in a direction where maybe a hotel was. But now I didnt need any hotel anymore, so I left the tea plantage.

I was going to the Periyar Sanctuaryat the border to Tamil Nadu. First I missed it and I was riding down with much speed to about 400 m altitude. There I was said I am already in Tamil Nadu and I have to go back. Again upwards, maybe 400m. 10 min. down, 1h up...I was a bit disappointed because I couldnt go into the park with my bike. The normal way is to take a boat trip or to take
DSCF3199
no...
a tour guide which you had to book in advance. The second alternative sounded better, but another day staying there I wasnt going for that. So I took the touristical boat trip. And as I thought it was quite boring. Of course, the animals are running away by such a noisy boat going along the lake. When the staff said: ""Look, a deer!"" Everybody was getting to his feet and making pictures. But from a big distance we could see two elephants and wild pigs and a buffalo. Next to the boat we have seen two otters. An Indian tourist group m,ade much fotos of me and my bike. Maybe I was the most interesting being they have seen in the park 😊

Tamil Nadu I liked much more than Kerala, not so crowded and you easily find sleeping places 😊 In restaurants the food is served on palm leaves, very cool! In the days I arrived here there is a festival, especially celebrated in the countryside. As far as I have understood are the cows celebrated. They are often coloured, their fur and their horns. And in the villages there comes from big loudspeakers loud music, with a
DSCF3200
no...
very bad quality. I often was awakened by this music.



My two tent bars are broken now. Now the tent is a bit unstable there is little space inside and it is not drying so easy. But it still works. Hopefully I can get it fixed in Chennai!

One day I was staying at a lake. One guy asked me where I want to go now and I said I want to look for sleeping place. He was discussing something with another guy. I said:""For example here!"" Because I liked this place and was annoyed of their disussion. They found it quite funny I think that I want to stay there and said:""I like this place!"" They said something about cold, mosquitos, snakes, but no reasons not to stay there with my tent. They phoned to some friends and aftyer a few minutes the half village was watching me pitching my tent up. Every newcomer was greeted with the words:""...I like this place!..."" accompanied with some laughter. Didnt know that this sentence was so funny... The next morning when I got up a guy saw me and he whistled to the village that everybody could join
DSCF3201
no...
the morning show of the strange crazy foreigner that likes that place.

I went to Puducherry in a bar restaurant. It was noon, but it was very full and loud and all people drinking. I had two beers and a little snack there. I was a bit drunk. I think I am not used to drink anymore. In the near I was also in the sea, seemed to be a famous beach by the locals. But it was funny that they just stood around. Not like at us, where everybody is lying at a towel or so. Only few were in the water, mostly little children. However, that didnt keep me from having a nice refreshing bath.

From Puducherry I followed the coast to Chennai. I had a little misunderstanding with Sepp, I thought he will arrive at Friday night in Chennai, but it was on Sunday night. So I had suddenly 2 more days where I was quite lazy, was often in an internetcafe and wrote some diary.
