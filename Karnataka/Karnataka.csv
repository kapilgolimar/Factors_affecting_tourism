Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
Agumbe is a little village half an hour (30km) from the town of Thirtalli or, on the usual road, an hour (55km) from Udupi. There are a small handful of cheap places to stay in Agumbe, the one I chose being the Mallya Residency which is by the bus stand and costs 500 rupees (about NZ$10). Right on the edge of the village is the Someshwara Wildlife Sanctuary, which is where the lion-tailed macaques are found. The road from Udupi runs right through this forest, and given how narrow and winding it is, it was actually good that it was currently out of action because it meant that when I was walking on it there was almost no traffic. There was some traffic because only part of the road was being resurfaced, so motorbikes and a few cars were still using it, and there were trucks carrying gravel for the job, but none of them were that regular.

I had got into Agumbe at 8.15am but couldn't get a room at Mallya until check-out time which was 9am, so I wandered off to find some breakfast first. After all that was sorted I headed off towards the forest. From the
Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
hotel it is maybe half a kilometre to the start of the forest where there is a checkpoint and a sign saying you need to get permission to enter. But there was no guard there (ever) and nobody seemed to mind that I was walking through. At one point a forest guard on a motorbike stopped to say I needed a permit and guide in the forest but if I was just on the road then that was fine.

Before getting to the checkpoint you do need to run the gauntlet of dogs. There are a lot of dogs in Agumbe. As I was getting off the bus a pack of about ten of them charged past barking and snarling. They were actually after another dog, possibly because he didn't have rabies yet and they were going to teach him a lesson, but the group of girls that had been on the bus started screaming in panic which did not make me think that dog attacks were unknown here! I didn't have any trouble with the dogs in the end. Most were cowardly and harmless. A few liked to bark. I have recently developed a technique whereby when a
Black-footed Grey Langur (Semnopithecus hypoleucos)
dog is acting aggressively, instead of running away and crying like a little girl, I just throw it a couple of biscuits which I carry for that purpose. Then the dog is suddenly all ""ooh, a piece of candy"" and forgets to be aggressive. Then next time I see the dog it thinks we're friends. Probably doesn't work with actual guard dogs or rabid dogs, but for the average strays and dogs-about-town it works well.

I haven't been adding many new birds lately. Most of the species I see in southern India are ones that I saw in Sri Lanka or elsewhere. In the first ten days or so I saw about 120 species in the Western Ghats, and only 29 were lifers. Today I saw quite a lot of birds, but none of them new ones. Also lots of bonnet macaques and four Malabar giant squirrels. The subspecies of giant squirrel further south in Kerala is maxima which is very dark-coloured - apart for the pale belly and head it is otherwise all black with maroon saddle. The subspecies here in Karnataka is indica which has all the black areas replaced with maroon and it is even more
Malabar Giant Squirrel (Ratufa indica)
attractive.

At the Mallya Residency I had asked the chap at the front where the best place to see the lion-tailed macaques was and he had replied without hesitation ""Sunset Point"". This is about two kilometres along the road through the forest. A hundred metres before you get there, there is a small lake for boating and a checkpost. There was a squadron of bonnet macaques lined up along the lake's fence, waiting to be fed by visitors. I asked one of the guards where the best place to see lion-tailed macaques was, and he also immediately said ""Sunset Point"". There were, as might be guessed, no lion-tailed macaques at Sunset Point, which is a concrete viewing platform sticking out from the road over the downward slope of the mountain.

The road from this point turned into a series of hairpin bends. There didn't seem any reason I shouldn't keep walking, so down I went, for just over seven kilometres - I know this because I passed the end of the roadworks and the foreman told me that only the top 7km are Agumbe's concern, all the rest belongs to the Udupi district and it is up to
Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
them to sort it out. So the road was closed just for the top 7km to be resurfaced. Just about everyone who passed on a motorbike or who was working on the road wanted a photo with me. I guess not that many white tourists end up here.

There were more bonnet macaques along the road down here too, and I also saw a jungle striped squirrel and a group of black-footed grey langurs. Those last two mammals were what had made me think the Tholpetty jaunt wasn't a total loss. Of the four new birds I saw at Tholpetty the wire-tailed swallow and white-rumped spinetail are both more common further north so I'll probably see them again; and the crimson-backed sunbird is very common at Agumbe (just about every small bird I got my binoculars onto here was one of these sunbirds). I won't see Malabar barbets anywhere from now on, so that becomes the sole species from Tholpetty that I didn't or won't see elsewhere. When I had found out the langurs were found here at Agumbe I thought maybe they would be more difficult to see than at Tholpetty, but in fact they are very easy
Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
to see, although still quite shy.

After quite a lot of walking, thinking about how maybe just round the next bend there would be a lion-tailed macaque, I decided to call it quits for the morning. It was getting very hot, the return walk was going to be all uphill, and I had a suspicion that the roadworks would have made sure the macaques were keeping away from the road. It turned out that the roadworks may have been keeping them away but for a different reason than noise or smell - with the road mostly not being used, there were no motorists coming along to feed the monkeys. Like at Valparai, the reason the lion-tailed macaques are easy to see here is because they have become habituated to being fed and so remain next to the roadsides.

In the afternoon I returned through the forest to Sunset Point. On the way I saw two different groups of black-footed grey langurs, and I think I may have even got some passable photos of some of them. There were still bonnet macaques at Sunset Point, but no lion-tailed macaques. Back at the hotel in the evening I was filling
Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
out the registration book (because the owner Suhindra hadn't been there in the morning) and when I said I hadn't seen any lion-tailed macaques everyone expressed surprise. I just needed to go down ""six bends"" on the road and the macaques were ""always there"". I dislike when someone says an animal is ""always there"" or ""guaranteed"" because it usually means you are not going to see it! Suhindra said one of the guys would take me down to the spot on his motorbike the next morning and I would definitely see them. No need to be early, ten o'clock is fine for the macaques - they are ""always there"". Hmm.

At 10am I met up with Anankumar who, it turned out, worked as a guide for trekking in the forest. Normally this month is busy for him but with the Udupi road closed there was almost nobody coming to the area. He also said that maybe I could see one or two lion-tailed macaques at Sunset Point but only sometimes. So that's not the best place after all. Down the road we went (many more bends than six!), and at about 8km there was suddenly a male lion-tailed macaque
Bonnet Macaque (Macaca radiata)
with its throat pouches stuffed with food
standing on a big rock, waiting. Just one kilometre more and I would have seen them yesterday! There were a few more visible here and there in the trees, including some tiny baby ones, but they didn't seem eager to show themselves. There were also black-footed grey langurs in the trees, equally shy, and bonnet macaques on the roadside, not shy at all. Three monkey species in one spot.

Anankumar said if we had some bananas I would be able to get photos because then the lion-tailed macaques would come out, so I waited there while he shot off on his bike to the village of Someshwara a kilometre or so further on. Soon he returned and the second he opened the box in which he had put the bananas he was swarmed by bonnet macaques. The lion-tailed macaques came galloping out onto the road but mostly missed out. Anankumar said normally the macaques will take the food by hand, but there were so few people passing by lately that they were all famished. That's one of the obvious issues with monkeys becoming habituated to being fed at roadsides - they lose the habit of going and finding their
Lion-tailed Macaque (Macaca silenus)
food naturally. I did get a lot of photos of the lion-tailed macaques, and some of them are quite good ones.

baby Bonnet Macaque (Macaca radiata)
I spent all of Christmas Day on buses and trains. I left Mananthavady in the dark at 6.30am, and finished in the dark at 6.30pm in a town called Thirithalli (in the state of Karnataka above Kerala).

This part of the trip is all about lion-tailed macaques. They used to be called wanderoos in the old days, which makes them sound like some sort of Australian animal, possibly one with a tendency to roam, but they are actually monkeys. I seem to go looking for monkeys a lot, I'm not sure why. They just appeal to me as mammals to find in the wild. In 2013 a girl in China said to me ""you must really like monkeys"". I guess so. I'm currently on thirteen species of primates for this trip, by the way. (Or, not to give anything away, fourteen if I include the lion-tailed macaque). Anyway, the lion-tailed macaque is a big black monkey with a white mane like a lion and a tuft on the end of the tail (hence ""lion-tailed"", although ""lion-maned"" would probably be a better name). They are another one of the Western Ghats specialities, and like many of the animals of this region
Bonnet Macaque (Macaca radiata)
are now endangered through hunting and habitat loss.

Most people who go looking for wanderoos make their way to a place called Valparai which is in the tea country, somewhat near to Munnar. In fact to get there you start in Munnar, bus to Udamalpet (which is the town next on from Marayur, where I stayed when I was visiting the Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary), then bus to Pollachi, and then bus to Valparai. This was my original plan way back when, but I couldn't find out much on cheap places to stay in Valparai - it all seems to be expensive estate lodges on the tea plantations. Then I happened to see a photo of a lion-tailed macaque taken at a place called Agumbe. I made some Google searches, and decided this was much more like it for me. Agumbe is a little village in the forest 55km (about an hour) north of a large town called Udupi. There are budget accommodations in both Udupi and Agumbe, and it also makes a handy stop to break up the journey northwards (or southwards, as was the original case). I also just found out, while looking in my Indian mammal guide after getting back from Tholpetty, that black-footed grey langurs are found at Agumbe too.

It's a bit of a long haul to get from Mananthavady to Agumbe. I had been told at the Mananthavady bus station that I needed to catch first a bus to Kannur (3 hours), then a bus to Kasargode (four hours), then a bus to Mangalore (three hours), then a bus to Udupi (one hour), and then finally a bus to Agumbe (one hour). All up, twelve hours. Of course that wasn't exactly how things went although I was travelling for twelve hours without actually reaching Agumbe that day.

My first bus, the one to Kannur, left at 6.30am. I showed the conductor the bit of paper on which the route had been written, to make sure that he understood when I said ""Kannur"" and I didn't end up somewhere entirely different. He looked it over and said I would be better off getting the train from Kannur to Mangalore because this would take only half the time of the buses for that leg. I wasn't sure this would be an option because of the way the train system in India works - or at least how I thought it worked based on everything I had been reading before going to India - but I decided that when I got to Kannur I would hit the train station first to see if it was possible, and if not revert to the buses.

Now, the train system in India is not, so I had read, like in other countries. In most countries you go to the station, buy a ticket, get on the train. Easy. Even in China which has however many billions of people I could just go to the station and get straight on a train. In India, apparently, you cannot do that. You can only buy the tickets online, on the official government train site, and you really need to do so weeks or months in advance if you want to have any chance of actually getting a ticket. Indians are right into planning. I prefer winging it, so I figured I'd be travelling mostly on buses. To book your train tickets you first need to register with the site, and I had read of some foreigners waiting months for their registration to be verified. And just to complicate things, until just a few years ago the site would only accept Indian credit cards, so tourists had no choice but to buy from agents instead. The only ways to get tickets last-minute is with what they called Taktal where a small number of seats on each train are held off-line and released the day before travel, but these sell out within a few minutes; and for tourists there are a limited number of seats reserved specifically for them (the Tourist Quota) but only on the main routes and you can only buy these in person after much paperwork at the main train stations.

That was my understanding of the situation. All I knew in the converse was that when I was in Assam in 2014 I had bought a train ticket at the station, but I figured that must be because Assam isn't really India. So I wasn't holding out hope that I would be able to get a train from Kunnar to Mangalore. The bus conductor was sure though, so I gave it a shot. And you know what? At the station there is a ticket office and queues of people buying tickets for their trains. Same as everywhere else in the world. Stupid internet and Lonely Planet.

The bus from Mananthavady to Kunnar took almost exactly three hours as promised. I took a short tuktuk ride to the train station and bought a ticket for the 10am train, which cost just 75 rupees. The train, perhaps expectedly, was not on time. It instead arrived at 10.30 and departed at 10.45. I had no idea what was written on the ticket because one, the printing was so faint; and two, none of it was in English. I asked a few people around and they said there are no seat or carriage numbers, you just get on and sit anywhere. This wasn't entirely accurate, because there are different prices for sleeping carriages, seated carriages, and A/C carriages. When a ticket inspector came through and found me in one of the sleeping carriages he informed me that my ticket was for a seated carriage, but he was perfectly nice about it because I was a foreigner and because he collected foreign currencies. I gave him a one Ringgit note from Malaysia and a 500 Dong note from Vietnam. Then I was his best friend and he let me stay where I was.

The train got into Mangalore Central Station at just after 1pm (so just under 2.5 hours). I had some lunch at the station then jumped on a bus for Udupi which was parked right outside. This bus left at 1.20 - and went straight to the Mangalore bus stand five minutes away where it sat until 1.50. Then we were underway - to another part of town where we sat for another ten minutes. Then we were underway! Yes? Yes. An hour later I was in Udupi.

There were a lot of buses at the Udupi bus stand, no English signs, and no apparent main office. I asked a guy at one of the food stalls where I could get a bus to Agumbe, to which he replied that there was no bus to Agumbe. This didn't seem right, especially as I was one hundred percent positive that there was a bus to Agumbe. But no, he said the road was under repair so there were no buses or any other form of transport on the Udupi to Agumbe route. This was a small wrinkle in my plans. I next asked a passing bus conductor and he pointed me towards a nearby bus. There I was informed that there was no bus to Agumbe because of the road repairs, but I could take this bus to Thirtalli and then from there I could get a bus to Agumbe. The bus was leaving at 3.20 and would get to Thirtalli, where-ever that was, at 6.30pm. But there were no Agumbe buses at that time, so better I stay in Udupi and go the next morning. I asked if there were any cheap lodgings in Thirtalli, to which they replied in the affirmative, so I got on the bus. I'd rather just go now and only have a half-hour journey from Thirtalli to Agumbe the next morning, than have to spend almost four hours getting there then.

The bus did indeed arrive in Thirtalli at exactly 6.30pm - buses are obviously more punctual than trains in India! Opposite the bus stand was a lodge which I don't know the name of but which only cost 250 rupees for a room (about NZ$5). And then the next morning at 7.45 I caught my final bus to reach Agumbe.

King of Pineapple
We left Orange County in Coorg and drove over 4 hours to Soans Farm near Moodibidri where pineapple juice flows like water. I know it sounds like we are doing a fruit tour of India, but really it is just ironic that we landed at two plantations within a few days!

We had to leave our comfortable spot nestled in coffee country very early in the morning because we we had to drive through an area that was dealing with some disruptive protesting. There were people angry with the government and planned a protest that last year involved someone getting killed. So, they were being very cautious moving the tourists out of the area. We ended up being stopped at too many check points to count and witnessed a huge police presence, but other than that we avoided any issue.

Our destination for several days was Soans Farm, a farm run by two brothers and their families which was known for incredible pineapple juice. Incredible might not be a strong enough word to describe the pineapple juice they produce and sell at Soans. It is fresh, contains no water or sugar and is served very cold. Delicious!

The
Our Cottage at Soans
brothers who run the farm are two interesting and engaging men who welcomed us onto their farm and into their home, educated us on the plants grown on the farm and provided very engaging conversation when they included us in high tea each afternoon.

Dr. Soans is a practicing doctor who studied at the University of Montana and worked summers at a sheep farm in Colorado. When he was not tending to his patients who stop by the farm to meet with him, he had time to chat with us. During one conversation with him he said, ""That is cornier than Kansas in August!"" Needless to say, we have been chuckling about that ever since.

Soans Farm is a farmstay where visitors stay with the family, eat on the farm and can learn more about the biodiversity. They had one cottage located in the middle of the pineapple fields where Kyle, dad and I stayed. We were the only visitors staying there and we stayed for several days.

We had our own kitchen, bedrooms, bathrooms and verandas. Each meal time, Dr. Soans' son rode a mo-ped up the long drive leading to our cottage and brought us
Harvest Time
a traditional Indian meal.

We spent our days doing nothing but walking the fields, talking, relaxing, enjoying high tea and washing it all down with pineapple juice. At night, we listened to the call to prayer from the nearby mosques, the call of the many wild peacocks that scurried around the farm and the call of the jackals who came out at night.

Deep in Thought in the Forest
We left the dusty, dry desert of Rajasthan and flew 1,125 miles south to Bangaluru. From Jaipur to Bangaluru, our flight took a little over 2 and a half hours. Once we arrived in Bangaluru, we drove over 6 and a half hours to reach Coorg, India. The roads were rough and winding along our drive and every village had speed bumps so it was difficult to move at a very fast speed.



We are officially in the southern part of India. This is apparent to us because:

* The landscape has changed dramatically. It looks more lush and more tropical. There are flowers, crops and fruit trees everywhere you look. The horizon is dotted with palm trees.

* The locals have slightly darker skin coloring than those in the northern parts of India.

*There seems to be less rubbish, but this could be because we are in a very remote area and have spent our time in only small villages.

* It is much more humid than Rajasthan.

* It feels like we could be visiting Sri Lanka. The landscape looks like Sri Lanka. It is more common for people to use

their hands as eating untensils rather than using forks or spoons. The Indians in the south have perfected what we always called the Sri Lankan nod--an ambiguous head nod that seems to say ""yes,"" ""no"" and ""whatever you want"" all at the same time.

* The buildings look more like the orient than expected. It seems like we could be visiting Thailand when we look at some of the homes.

* There is less vegetarian-only meals. Chicken, fish and eggs are incorporated more into the meals.

* There is a much greater Christian influence and many more Christians living in the south, though there are still Hindus and Muslims in most villages.

* There are NO camels.



Please recognize, these are just our early observations and could easily be challenged as we travel further south and to more locations.



Our first stop in the south was at Orange County in Coorg. I know it sounds like we are in the land of plastic surgery and overpriced housing, but actually we are staying on a 300 acre coffee plantation/eco resort. It is gorgeous. It is peaceful. And it is posh. This
Our Back Yard
is easy living at it's best with hospitality like you can only imagine.

We spent our time hiking, learning how spices and exotic fruits are grown and learning how the spices are harvested to be ready for our dinner table. Oh, and we have spent some time eating...a lot of time actually!

We took a class on how coffee is grown, harvested and processed which ended with us learning how to properly drink a cup of coffee to fully embrace the aroma. It should be no shock that dad had his best cups of coffee in India so far at this coffee plantation.

We hiked the plantation and were told the high electric fences were designed to keep the elephants out of the rows of coffee, but we were also told the elephants quickly figured out that they could lay a branch on the electric fence to ground it out so they could enter the plantation to eat the mango fruit off the mango trees! Talk about smart animals.

We can tell we are in for a a very different India that we have been seeing and we are excited to be here.

Sunset at Krishna River, Vijayawada
Self-driving from Bangalore to Kolkata and back was a crazy idea. I travelled from Bangalore to Kolkata (my native place) at least hundred times by Air and railways during last ten years. But whenever I expressed my plan for a pleasure road trip to Kolkata and back driving my own car, I received a cold response from my family.

This time when I attempted for booking a ticket for Kolkata during Dussera holidays in vein, my insane idea received a fillip. Unlike other years, I left my search for ticket further and decided to prepare for a road drive.

For covering from Bangalore to Kolkata and back, I had to drive nearly 4000 Kms. There were various alternative routes. After lot of research, exploring the net and collecting information, I thought of adopting the following route :

Bangalore-Tirupati-Nellore-Guntur-Vijayawada-Rajahmundry-Vizag-Srikakulam-Gopalpur on sea-Barakul (Chilka lake)-Bhubaneswar-Baleswar-Kagarpur-Kolkata

I planned to complete my journey in 11 days with stoppages as follows :

1. Day 1 – Start from Bangalore Stay at Rajahmundry

2. Day 2 – Stay at Gopalpur on sea,

3. Day 3 – Reach Kolkata

4. Day 4 to 6 – Kolkata

5. Day 7 &
Bridge on Krishna River, Vijawawada
8 – Stay at Puri

6. Day 9 – Ananthagiri, Araku Valley

7. Day 10- Stay at Vijayawada

8. Day 11 – Reach Bangalore in the evening



Before commencement of the tour, I thoroughly serviced my Hyundai Xcent car, my trusted friend and companion in all long distance journeys.

My original plan was to commence from Bangalore in the afternoon and to stay at Tirupati during first night. Accordingly I booked accommodation in advance in all the places thru Magicbrick.com (except Gopalpur on sea thru Orissa Tourism and Ananthagiri, Araku thru Andhra Pradesh Tourism). Unfortunately, two subsequent events severely threatened my plan. First was the news of heavy rain in Coastal Andhra Pradesh flooding Hyderabad, Guntur and other places starting around two weeks prior to my journey. At one point I thought of cancelling my trip since it was too risky to drive such a long distance thru flooded highways. To my luck, weather improved a lot in subsequent days. But sudden aggravation of illness of my 90 year old father again put me in test to re-think about my trip.



06th October, 2016- Thursday : Bangalore to Rajahmundry via
View of Seven Hills from Hotel room Tirupati
Tirupati, Vijayawada

I started my drive at 4 O Clock in the morning. I could not sleep whole night because of excitement. My father looked better and my sister arrived to look after him during my absence. Although I missed the first night planned at Tirupati but could commence my drive at last, by the grace of god.

It was always advantageous to start at the early morning. City was in deep sleep with virtually empty road except vehicles carrying IT/Call centre employees. It was heartening to think, I would be free from day to day monotony of office work for next two weeks.

After Kolar (60 Kms), the depth of darkness was fading in the horizon. Watching the arrival of new dawn was a heavenly sight, although happening every day religiously from time immemorial. Being city residents we inculcated the habit of sleeping late night and missing this heavenly exercise gifted by the creator. I was driving towards the east and delighted to enjoy the arrival of new dawn piercing the darkness. The whole world around me was awakening lazily.

By the time daylight approached clearly, I reached the Mulbagal Toll Gate (95 Kms). There
Statute of Sir Arthur James Cotton, Rajahmundry
was third tollgate at around 110 Kms and six lane highway from Bangalore ended here. I passed Karnataka Border to enter Andhra Pradesh. Being a heavily crowded two lane road, it needed careful drive particularly in the early morning when there was high probability of accident. This narrow road stretching nearly 60 Kms was popular amongst the goods and vehicles carrying trucks. Overtaking a long vehicle carrying newly manufactured cars was a big challenge.

Proceeding past Palmaner at around 6.45 AM near Chittoor (174 Kms), I took left turn to take the road towards Tirupati. That was a smooth drive with less traffic until reaching near Tirupati. In between I had to spend nearly half an hour waiting in two railway crossings.

Hotel Fortune Grand Ridge ITC, Tirupati

I already booked this hotel thru Makemy trip.com at a very cheap rate (Rs 1700) for halting the previous night, but could not avail due to my pre-occupation. I arrived the hotel at around 9.15 AM(252 Km) , checked in to refresh and have complimentary breakfast. I came to Tirupati many times and must say this was one of the best hotel here. Rooms were spacious with all modern
Two parallel bridges on River Godavari, Rajahmundry
facilities having excellent view of the Seven hills. Nice clean toilet, beautiful reception lounge and convenient car parking. Last but not the least was its multi cuisine complimentary breakfast which I did not want to miss. I had a refreshing bath, finished my BF and a brief rest for nearly an hour. Overall it was a pleasant experience.

Resuming the drive

I resumed my journey at 11 AM. It was a sunny day and temperature outside the car was getting warmer. Drive spanning next 70 Kms was thru four Lane highway. Road condition was fine although occasionally crowded. Finally I reached Naidupeth (320 Km) at around 12.15 PM. This place had been crucial since now I could enter NH 16 which would take me virtually upto the end of my destination.

It was extremely hot outside. Road condition was excellent upto Nellore and it was a pleasure to drive. Road diversions started near Nellore and it continued in various places thereafter. Obviously it slowed down the speed. I could notice significant water accumulations in the fields both sides of the highway signifying heavy rainfall occurred few days back.

I was feeling hungry and finished my lunch
Huge Railway Bridge on Godavari Rajahmundry
with the fruits and snacks I carried with me. Usually I avoid heavy lunch during long drive since it causes giddiness which is dangerous for driving.

A brief siesta

Continuous effortless driving for a long period in a well built highway had the disadvantage of creating monotony in absence of any excitement. Suddenly I had felt so sleepy that it was hard to keep my eyes open, possibly due to early morning start. Finding extremely risky to continue further, I parked my vehicle roadside and had a brief siesta. It was unbearably hot outside. My car’s AC had not been generating enough coolness since the vehicle was not moving. But that could hardly prevent my sleep.

I got up after nearly half an hour. I felt fresh with renewed energy and resumed my drive.

Twilight in Vijayawada

It was around 6 PM and I was crossing the bridge on Krishna River to enter Vijayawada (670 Km). A beautiful red and golden sun was going down below the horizon. I stopped my car to enjoy the spectacular sunset. Entire surrounding was looking reddish and mystic with twilight sun. The bridge was busy with huge traffic. I
My trusted friend & Companion, on the way to Vizag
suspected nobody was noticing this pleasant scene except me. There is a sunrise and a sunset every single day which God has given absolutely free. We should not miss many of them.

Evening sunlight was fading quickly with city lights looked bright in the darkness. My Google map changed to glowing night colors. Vijayawada was a big and busy city. I read about shortcuts in the net but decided to stick to NH 16 only. There were number of traffic signals to negotiate, with vehicular movement at snail speed. At the city outskirts both sides of the highway were decorated with well maintained gardens. I had to spent nearly an hour to cross it. My today’s destination Rajahmundry was still 185 Kms away.

Road condition deteriorated after Vijayawada and continued almost upto Rajahmundry. There were number of potholes, some of them big enough to damage the car if not negotiated properly, particular during night drive. I wanted to reach Rajahmundry quickly, but had no other alternative but to be slow and careful.

Hotel River Bay – Rajahmundry

At last when I could reach my destination (832 Km), it was around 9.30 PM. I booked Hotel
Dark cloud just before heavy downpour - Near Vizag
River Bay (Rs 1477) thru Magicbricks.com. Hotel was located far away from the NH. Thanks to my GPS, it was impossible for me to locate the hotel otherwise. Nevertheless the advantage was, I could meet the mighty Godavari River and the illuminated bridge in the distant horizon immediately after check-in.

Time for quick refreshment since while checking in I was intimated that the restaurant would be closed at 10 PM. My stomach was burning. I ordered for fish curry with rice. Fish was fresh (I was told that it was of River Godavari) and the curry was cooked nicely. It was an excellent and satisfying dinner.

07th October, 2016 – Friday –Rajahmundry to Gopalpur on Sea – Maha Sasthi Durgapuja

I woke up late due to yesterday’s tiredness. My first job was to meet the river. There was a small garden within the hotel compound but on the riverbank. The place was ideal for walking as well as enjoy the morning. The mighty river was huge and widespread here, may be due to heavy rain occurred a week back. Weather was cloudy but humid.

The hotel was spread in a wide area. This hotel was
Dark clouds kissing the lights - Way to Vizag
one of the oldest here. There were number of river-facing rooms to enjoy the splendid beauty of the river. But maintenance was an issue. Furniture and wardrobe inside the room looked old and needed proper upkeep. Gardens inside the hotel needed better maintenance. The same was applicable in respect of the front office also. Complimentary Break fast was refreshing.

Sir Arthur James Cotton - the forgotten hero

There were no of statutes throughout the hotel garden. Out of that, one interesting full statute of a foreigner on a horse-back attracted my attention. I saw the name encrypted below the statute. He was Sir Arthur James Cotton, the architect of Dowelswaram Dam built on the river Cauvery at Rajahmundry around 150 years ago (1855). Many Britons contributed immensely to address the misery of common people in India during the British rule. I came to know from the hotel reception that he was distressed by the sufferings of the people at Godavari basin ravaged by cyclone and flood. The result was one of the finest human creations on the Godavari river benefiting the inhabitants for more than one hundred and fifty years.

I was ashamed that I hadn’t heard
Sunrise at Gopalpur on Sea
his name before. He was still revered by the people in this region. Surprisingly, even without any publicity or pomp. My sincere regards to this great personality. This was the greatest reward of my brief stay at Rajahmundry.

Navaratri celebration at Rajahmundry

I started late at around 10 AM after a brief car cleaning. My plan was to quickly visit nearby places. As advised by hotel reception I visited the Mercanda Swamy temple. Today was the sixth day of Navratri (or Durga Sasthi), an auspicious day. Durga puja was observed in Bengal mostly in makeshift pandals. Seriousness in performing puja was not noticed in many places and entertainment prevails over, in the name of puja.

But Rajahmundry was famous for its cultural and religious heritage for centuries. It was called the Varanasi of South India. Here the Navaratri celebration was largely centered around various temples. Many places of the city were decorated on the occasion of Navratri. Large no of people could be noticed on streets going towards various temples with their offerings. Men were dressed in Red/White Dhoti and women also similar colour.

I had a very good darshan of Lord Siva and Goddess
OTDC Panthanibas - Gopalpur on Sea
Parvati at Mercanda Swamy Temple. My next visit was to Pushkar Ghat on the bank of River Godavari. This place was located between two lengthy bridges over the huge river. People were taking dip in the river to refresh from heat. Religious ceremonies were being performed by groups of people under the shadow of banyan trees. Barbers and priests seemed to be on demand here. Some people were taking rest under the shadow. I found lot of similarities of this place to the bathing ghats on the bank of River Ganges in Kolkata. Rivers had deep rooted connection with our culture and religious rites. This place was no exception.

It was getting late (11.30 AM) and I decided to leave Rajahmundry so that my next destination, Gopalpur on Sea could be reached on time. Gopalpur was around 460 Km from Rajahmundry. Krishnavaram and Tuni were crossed at around 1.30 PM. Outside weather was extremely heated and confining myself inside the car was the best option.

NH 16 was excellent to drive so far. However after Tuni it was concrete road in various places. That road became heated in sunlight creating friction with the car tyres particularly while driving
Shining NH 16 after a downpour
at a high speed. Once the sound of friction was so loud, I stopped my car to check whether the car tyres were ok. I found nothing unusual and decided to proceed further.

Green mountains all around

I was nearing VIzag and the surroundings were blessed with splendid natural beauty. There were small and medium-sized hills all around. Most noteworthy was that, all the nearby and distant hills were green full of vegetation, sometimes large trees. There were greeneries all around, as if the almighty painted with different varieties of Green Color. Some of nearby hills were covered with thick green umbrella. I travelled thru national highways of many other parts of South India in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka many times. But mountains therein looked barren at many places and lush thick vegetation like here was not a common sight.

Suddenly weather changed drastically and heavy rain started. Initially, it was confined to a particular zone. After few kilometres it was totally dry, not a single drop of rain.

An un-forgettable lunch

I noticed a bridge culvert and railway track passed beneath it. There were hills all around, wherever I looked. I selected this place
Hotel Fortune Grand Ridge ITC, Tirupati
to have my lunch and stopped the car. By then color of the entire surroundings outside totally changed. Day light reduced considerably and became amazingly mystic. Black clouds were seen all around. Distant hills looked fading in the horizon. It was raining heavily. Raindrops were so heavy and forceful, I could hear the sound loudly sitting inside the car. Only other resonance was of heavy vehicles painstakingly moving thru the highway. Highway truly smiled and became shining with black color when rain pours on it. The whole environment was spiritual and breathtaking. I enjoyed the gift of nature solitarily and finished one of the best lunch I have ever made with snacks and fruits. This was definitely one of the best memories which I would cherish for many years.

Do not follow Google map blindly

Near Anakapalle, my Google Map directed to leave NH 16 and take left to enter Chennai-Srikakulam Highway. I followed the same and committed a big mistake. Although this two-lane highway (and subsequently SH 38) reduced the distance and entering Vizag city could be avoided, driving this road was extremely painful and time consuming. Road condition was extremely bad and full of crator-like potholes
Hotel River Bay on the bank of Godavari, Rajahmundry
throughout the road. Moreover this road was selected by all goods carrying vehicles to make short-cut. That made the drive more difficult. In fact this was presumably the most difficult part of my entire journey from Bangalore to Kolkata and back. The entire journey of around sixty kilometres took nearly one and half hours. An important learning was not to follow the Google Map blindly.

When I again intersected NH 16, it was already 4.15 PM. I had to drive another 250 Kms to reach my destination. I always prefer to drive during daytime. Since I was driving towards the east, length of day was getting shorter. I increased my speed to cover up as much as possible in the next one hour. But after Srikakulam (1125 Km) it became almost dark.

Laxmipuram (1210 Km) was located in Andhra Pradesh-Orissa border. I could reach there at around 6.50 PM in darkness. Traffic was slow and hundreds of trucks were waiting to cross the border. I was getting impatient since it was already late, but with my subsequent experience in Orissa- West Bengal border (Jaleswar) next day, now I find this place much better. It took around half an
Train crossing Mahanadi - Bhubaneswar
hour to cross this palce.

Pleasure of drive thru black carpet

Rest of the journey was smooth and without any incident. Although it was totally dark at night, there was no difficulty in driving. Thanks to those people who were maintaining this highway. There was hardly any pothole or blockage on the entire stretch. Another noticeable feature was the presence of “glossy lane marker” between the lanes of this four/six lane highway. Only a motorist feels its importance during night driving. It guides the driver to select and follow the road at night even with high speed. I could maintain my speed of 100 to 120 Kms per hour even at night at ease. Overall it was a pleasant experience for me to drive this leg of my journey.

Gopalpur on Sea

I reached Gopalpur on sea (1260 Km) at around 8.30 PM. Thanks to my Google Map without which it was impossible for me to identify the correct left sideways towards Gopalpur from NH 16 in the total darkness . Distance of Gopalpur was around 15 Kms from the Highway on the right.

I already booked my accommodation in Panthanibas of Orissa Tourism, Government of Orissa (Rs 2750/-). I was advised to finish my dinner at the earliest since it was late. I refreshed myself quickly and obeyed the direction.

8th October, 2016 – Gopalpur on Sea to Kolkata :Maha-saptami Durga puja

Gopalpur was a popular tourist destination situated on the coast of Bay of Bengal. The Golden Sea Beach here attracted tourists, particularly from Kolkata and other parts of Eastern India. Although extremely tired after a long drive, last night I decided to wake up early next morning and not to miss the Sunrise. I was told that the chance of perfect sunrise was not guaranteed, since the Sun god was not kind enough during the last few days.

Early morning I reached the Sea beach and to my surprise hundreds of people were already waiting for the same reason. To our luck the sungod was kind today and it was a nice beginning of the “Seventh day of Navratri (Durga Mahasaptami).

Panthanivas, Gopalpur, Orissa Tourism

That was one of the oldest place of abode in Gopalpur. As far as my experience of stay was concerned, it was an average hotel. Tariff was much higher compared to other hotels of similar standard in South India. Location of the hotel was not ideal since the sea beach was not directly visible. I hired an AC Cottage (Tariff Rs 2750/-). This cottage included a spacious bed room, a drawing room, a dressing room and a toilet. Space-wise it was quite big and more than sufficient for a small family. But maintenance was an issue. I noticed a cockroach in the Toilet-seat. Bedsheets, Curtains and even towel provided,needed proper cleaning.

Breakfast was complimentary but of average standard. Similar experience I had last night, while taking my dinner. Quality of room service was also not satisfactory.

I checked out from hotel at around 8 AM. Today my plan was to complete my onward journey upto Kolkata (around 730 Kms from Gopalpur). Virtually my entire journey today would be thru NH 16. It was a sunny and pleasant morning. A wonderful drive upto Bhubaneswar (around 220 Kms from Gopalpur) and travelling thru that phase was a driver’s dream.

Chilka Lake

Very soon I reached near Chilka Lake and crossed well-known tourist attractions of Orissa like Rambha, Barakul, Chilka one after another. Before Rambha a quick downpour greeted me. As I narrated earlier, beauty of NH enhanced much more after a rain and the dry road got a new life.

Scenic beauty of this leg was breathtaking and beyond narration. NH 16 (towards east) proceeded here with mountain ranges on the left side and Chilka Lake on the other side. Onward road was separated at one place and went uphill towards the top before coming down after a distance once again to meet its counterpart. I stopped my car and sat on a hillock quite sometime to enjoy the enchanting beauty of nearby mountains and Chilka Lake on the distant downhill. This place was ideal to have a bird’s eye view of the entire area. Railway track was visible from the top and it was erected almost over the lake. Two goods trains were crossing each other from the opposite track and looked like match boxes.

Sitting on the hillock I could view the NH 16 proceeding towards the distant horizon, like a serpent. This portion was arguably the most scenic of my entire journey.

Memories of train journey thru Chilka

In my eighteen years of stay in Bangalore I traveled this place by train innumerable times. But whenever train was moving slowly thru chilka, I used to feel excited to peep outside, thru window or opening the compartment door. This used to happen even if the train used to run here at night. Viewing the mystic chilka at night during moonlight from the running train was a heavenly sight and was one of my cherished memories I would never forget. Usually the train used to move at medium speed here and I would get at least fifteen minutes to get a good view.

Bhubaneswar (1475 Kms) came at around 12.15 PM. It was a big city and I had to spend around 45 minutes to combat with busy traffic and cross the city. There were two lengthy bridges over famous rivers of Katjouri and then Mahanadi respectively immediately after Bhubaneswar. There were number of other rivers which I passed subsequently upto Balasore and even after Kharagpur. Names of those rivers were not mentioned anywhere and thus I could not identify many of them.

Bad roads after Bhubaneswar

Condition of road deteriorated after Bhubaneswar. There were innumerable number of diversions, sometimes going thru the opposite road and thru sideways in many places. Potholes, craters, water-logging and all kinds of possible hazards were part of this journey.

Negotiating skill with Vehicles and Animals coming from opposite direction

A dangerous feature of this journey was the movement of vehicles like cycles, tractors even cars coming from the opposite direction but in the same leg of the highway where I was driving. If that was not enough, all kinds of animals like Cattle, Goats, Dogs were merrily grazing on the road. In fact this experience began from yesterday (when I was crossing Andhra-Orissa Border) but to a reasonable limit. But after entering Orissa I had to face the same almost thru out the rest of my drive. Needless to mention that negotiating this stretch needed patience and caution to avoid possible catastrophe.

It was around 4.30 PM and I reached Balasore (1680 Kms). Road condition drastically improved thereafter and almost smooth upto Jaleswar (1740 Km) at Orissa-Bengal border (5.15 pm). I had a horrible experience here and without the help of a truck driver I would have halted here upto midnight.

Orissa-West Bengal Border, Jaleswar – a nightmare experience

I stopped my car before the border since the onward road was blocked by innumerable number of trucks and there was no passage to move forward. There was a gap between two lines of waiting trucks and I committed a terrible mistake to push my car inside the narrow space between the lanes. After crawling may be a few hundred yards I had to stop since there was no way to move further. I had to come out of the car and then noticed that the queue was more than a mile long, with thousands of trucks, totally blocking the road. When enquired, a truck driver explained that the Bengal border was closed due to Durgapuja celebration and would open only at 2 AM midnight i.e. after nearly nine hours. I was bewildered and did not know what to do, since the onward movement was out of question and it was extremely difficult to reverse my car and go back thru the narrow gap. Luckily the drivers waiting there were very friendly. Understanding my plight, they readjusted their waiting trucks taking lot of trouble and created space to reverse my car. Thanks to their assistance I could get out of the stalemate, took opposite side of the highway from a distance and crossed the border easily.

Plight of countless truck drivers never addressed

One important lesson of this journey was to feel the difficulties experienced by these drivers carrying goods inter-state. Thousands of trucks were waiting for hours (if not days) to enter another state, although both the states were within India. Is it really essential ? Plight of these people on the wheels were endless with unnecessary waiting, wastage of time, apart from monumental harassment by Police, Octroi and even brokers. I noticed a large no of plain dressed people (possibly brokers/agents), wondering, managing the queue of trucks and even directing those drivers. What a wastage of time and manpower only due to the lack of uniform regulations throughout India.

I heard that from next year the new Goods & Service tax (GST) would be effective and there would be uniformity in tax structure all over India. What will happen to those check posts? Will these distressed people get a better deal? I have no idea.

Entering West Bengal at last

Any way I was delighted to enter my native state (i.e. West Bengal) at last. Police at the check post advised me to drive with caution since the Durga Puja festival was being celebrated in various places. There were comparatively less no of vehicles on the road and of course no goods carrying vehicle (due to ban on entry in the inter-state border). Moreover the road condition was exceedingly good and it was a comfortable drive.

Durgapuja - a time of great rejoicing and festivity

I was passing thru Durga Puja pandals in both sides of the road. People came out in large numbers to visit the puja pandals and celebrate the occasion. Entire West Bengal and city of Kolkata were in a festive mood with illumination, music, thousand of food stalls and what not. In fact in the last few kilometres of my journey, entire road was almost taken over by people walking and almost every body looked to be in cheerful mood. There was heavy police posting throughout my journey and good traffic management could be noticed everywhere.



At last I could reach my ultimate destination in Kolkata (1990 Kms) at around 10 PM.

View from our cottage - Bandipur
Spending a night inside Bandipur National Park forest area was an exciting experience. There were no. of cottages inside Bandipur National Park. Some of them had two rooms while others were of big size having four rooms. Each of them had beautiful name like Kokila, Vanashree etc..

Thanks to the Karnataka Forest Department, presently booking of these rooms are comparatively easier thru on-line facility (compared to booking of Guest House in Nagarhole Tiger Reserve which we visited last month, i.e. July, 2016).

I attempted for a Bandipur trip during extended holidays of Independence Day, but in vein. There was no luck for next Saturday too, hence I could book a room on Sunday i.e. 21st August, 2016.




21st August, 2016 - Journey to Bandipur National Park

Bandipur National Park was around 230 Kms from Bangalore. The route we (myself and my wife) adopted was Bangalore-Mysore-Nanjangaud- Gundlupete-Bandipur. As usual we started late at around at 7.15 AM and caught into painful traffic in Bangalore - Mysore Highway. On the way, we had a break after Ramanagaram. There were both a Kamath Hotel as well as a Mc-Donald restaurant almost together, but we made a mistake
A cute dead tree root - Bandipur
opting traditional food in “Kamath Hotel”. Toilets were clean but without water which was very inconvenient, particularly for ladies.

Before Mysuru we turned left to take Ring Road. Normally it was a longer route opted to avoid the Mysuru city traffic. Thanks to guidance of GPS, we selected a narrow short cut road further left driving few kilometres thru the Ring Road and could reach NH 212 easily (almost opposite to Mysore airport). Sometimes GPS works wonder, but not always.

Road to Nanjanagudu was not easy to drive since road broadening work was going on in various places to make it a four lane Highway. Moreover it was quite crowded upto Nanjanagudu.

At around 12.15 PM we reached Gundlupete. That was an important place since two Highways, one towards Kerala (NH 212 upto Kozhikode) and another towards Ooty (NH 67) intersected here. The road to Kerala proceeded on the right from here, whereas Mysore-Ooty Highway progressed straight thru the Bandipur and Madhmalai Forests respectively to Ooty. We opted the straight route.

Bandipur Forest Check post was around 20 Kms from here. Thereafter it was an excellent drive inside the forest thru the mountain track. It was
Wild Mongoose Bandipur
a sunny day and nature was shining with its beauty. We reached Bandipur Tiger Reserve Area office at around 12.45 PM.

Forest safari also started from here.

We entered our details in the register. Our booking was made in Papiha I Cottage and room-tariff paid on-line. Additionally we had to deposit Rs. 440 on account of entry fee etc. On request for Receipt, we were told that it would be provided next day at the time of our departure. Unfortunately we did not obtain receipt next day also.




Tourist Cottages

As mentioned earlier, there were no of cottages of different sizes. All the cottages were located behind the forest office, one after another. Each of them had interesting names like :

1. Kokila, 2. Chital, 3. Papiha , 3. Mayuri, 4. Vanasuma, 5. Vanaranjani, 6. Vanashri



Kokila & Vanashri both had multiple rooms. Others were two room cottages.



From the forest office, Kokila & Chital would come first and then gradually other cottages. There was also a restaurant after Mayuri. Food was being served only at the restaurant and not at cottages.

According to
IMG_2855
us Vanaranjani and Vanashri were best located (after the canteen). Although slightly remote, these cottages were having least human disturbance. Another attraction was existence of no of trees standing behind these cottages. We could watch varieties of birds in those trees next morning. Although condition of these rooms inside was not known to me.



Tariff

Room tariff was Rs 1000 per room.

Safari Bus Ticket Ordinary @ Rs 300 per person, but for residents of forest cottages @ Rs 100 per person. That was a big advantage particularly for having multiple safari trips. Like Cottage, Safari tickets also could be booked online.

Jeep safari @ Rs. 3000 per vehicle for 6 persons.




Timing & Duration of safari

Bus safari Morning - 6.30 AM, 7.30 AM & 8.30 AM

Afternoon – 3.30 PM, 4.30 PM & 5.30 PM

Depending upon the availability of tourists

Duration – 1 hour




Condition of room

There were two rooms in Papiha cottage. We booked Papiha I. The room was spacious with adjacent toilet. There were two separate cots equipped with fantastic mosquito nets. Bed sheets
Wild Elephant group Bandipur
were not so clean. But we brought our own bedsheets. Windows were protected with two layers, one with iron wires and also mesh from outside. It was extremely difficult for any insect/mosquito to pierce thru the window.

Toilet was clean with necessary facilities (even hot water also). There was a common hall separating two rooms with seating arrangements and even dining table. As I mentioned food was served only at the canteen.

There were two sources of electricity. Normal electric points were not operational frequently due to power cut. Nevertheless back up points were facilitated with solar power panel.

On the whole it was a nice arrangement and an ideal place for a nature lover to enjoy nature having the comfort of all basic facilities.

Attendant handed over Room-key and quickly vanished. That was the last time we met him before collecting the key again next day.

Lunch would be served from 1.30 PM. Hence we thought of wandering nearby fields. Behind the cottage was a large field with plantations. Flocks of deer and wild pig could be seen wondering there. At the end of the field the dense forest started. Mountains could be seen
Wild Gaur Bandipur 2
on the distant horizon. It was a glaring day with beautiful sunshine, white clouds painted in blue sky. Nature was really smiling.

There was a small hillock just behind our cottage. We climbed the hillock and noticed a beautifully crafted branch of an uprooted tree. It was laid like a throne made by nature with awesome design. We sat on the throne, enjoyed cool breeze with bright sun-shine and magnificent view all around. A 360 degree view could be watched from here, virtually all sides. We could spend hours sitting here. But hungry belly and distant view of crowd near the canteen prevented us to wait further.




Wild safari

Ticket distribution for evening safari began at 3 PM. For boarders in cottages the safari rate was much lower (i.e. Rs 100 per head instead of Rs 300 i.e normal fare ). This was a distinct advantage, particularly for multiple trips if opted for.

Normally our animal luck was not encouraging during past safaris in other forests and even in Bandipur during earlier visits. This time we were lucky. We could see large groups of elephant and wild gour near a watertank. Peacocks and
Wild Gaur Bandipur
deers were plenty in number. Apart from that we had glimpse of mongoose and wild rabbit also. One of the reason might be, ours was the first bus in the evening trip entering the forest. Moreover, due to insufficient rain during last few weeks, wild animals came out in large numbers for drinking and we were lucky to watch them.

After the safari, we drove our car towards other end of the forest where the territory of Karnataka ended and Tamil Nadu state began (around 8 Kms). In fact the same forest continued to Tamil Nadu with new name of Madhumalai after crossing a small rivulet and the inter-state border Check Post. Entire drive was thru the dense forest and thoroughly enjoying.

Proceeding further the road was divided into two. We opted the route towards Masinagudi. That road ultimately reached to Ooty. Masinagudi was very popular tourist spot in Tamil Nadu and around 7 Kms from here. It was getting dark and we decided to come back.

Unlike in Nagarhole Tiger Reserve (Closed from 6PM to 6AM), both the check posts in Bandipur remain closed from 9PM upto 6 AM next day morning. We saw continuous traffic
God's painting Blue & White - on the way to Bandipur
in that road even after nightfall with beamer light, disturbing sound of heavy vehicles, definitely not conducive for wild animals.

Time for tea break, although it was 6.30 PM in the evening. Unfortunately, it was not available despite intense search. We had light refreshment with snacks from our stock.

It was chilly but excellent weather. A sweater would have provided more comfort. Last month our venture at Nagarhole forest was rainy. It was raining throughout the our stay, day and night. In fact there was no scope of roaming outside the Nagarhole guest house at night. But that was a different experience, particularly in a forest.




Watching stars at night

The time for wondering in the darkness and stargazing. Slightly away from the street light and innumerable stars were visible. It was clear sky and as if the whole universe had been glittering above us. Seven Sisters (Saptarshi Mondal), evening star, our nearest galaxy (probably milky way) and so many others which we did not know. I attempted to identify Kalpurush, but could not locate.




Deers everywhere

Deers. Hundreds of deers. Silently they were grazing all around the
Papiha Cottage - Bandipur Tiger Reserve
place. We could feel their presence by sparking the torchlight. Occasionally their barking sound was audible. Sound of animals emanating from darkness created a mysterious atmosphere. Last but not the least, the resonance of tree leaves. Sometimes whispering and suddenly loud. Really difficult to describe. To feel and fully realise the forest experience one should spend at least a night in a place like this.

We had dinner at around 8.30 PM for which I already purchased two coupons (@Rs 100). Thali meal was served with lot of varieties like Rice, vegetables, Papar, Roti (not fully baked), Rasam and Curd. I preferred not to touch Roti and Curd but consumed others.

There was no power cut in the evening. No mosquito, no insect inside the room. I parked my car adjacent to my cottage. The night guard told that elephants and even leopards would visit that place at night. We could not see any.




22nd August, 2016

When I woke up it was around 5 O Clock. It was a non-stop sleep, possibly due to fatigue of yesterday’s activities. I peeped from the window, totally dark outside, but sound of barking animals was
Papiha Cottage - Bandipur 2
audible. Our program would start with riding the first bus of Morning Safari.

We reached the counter but it opened at 6.15 AM. Monday being weekday, visitors were thin in number. We participated in two safaris i.e 6.30 and 8.30 AM respectively (both the safaris started late to collect minimum attendance). Unfortunately, beasts preferred to be in bushes except few deer and peacock. May be they were tired after nightlong duties. However we could notice many birds like Owl, Wood packers to name a few.

A memento shop was located near the Safari Ticket counter. We were looking for Wildlife stickers, unfortunately there was no stock. But that was compensated by watching excellent gymnastic display by monkeys on top of a geep. They were restless and totally engaged in their play until the driver rushed back and fired them from the spot.

Breakfast with Idli, Vada, Puri and tea. We went behind our Cottage once again. That area was gifted with lot of trees and home to varieties of birds. That place was heaven for bird watchers, particularly a row of mid-sized trees behind Vanasuma and Vanaranjini cottages, abode of hundreds of birds. We could watch from
Exploring the wild - Forest Safari Bandipur
a distance that a large group of Langoors ( at least thirty) had been sitting in a circle under the shadow of a large tree, possibly attending an important meeting.

We were alerted by the cottage-staff to check out. Check out time was 11 AM which we did not notice since the Check-in time started at 12 PM. Hurriedly we finished our bath and started our return journey.

There was a private memento shop after crossing the Forest Check Post named Temple Tree Designs. A nice place for collecting memories. We stopped on the way back and collected stickers and other gift items. Following the same route of our onward journey we returned back to Bangalore at around 5 PM.

Total distance covered was around 550 Kms.




Tips which may be helpful :

1. Online booking web-site http://www.bandipurtigerreserve.in, both for Cottage & Safari Bookings,

2. The objective of our visit was to feel, stay and enjoy the nature, hence we did not expect any luxury comfort or delicious menu which was not available there.

3. We carried two torchlights, which immensely helped us at night.

4. There was no
Check-point Bandipur Reserve Forest
mobile connection during our stay (Airtel),

5. There were frequent power-cut, during our stay, although having emergency lights at important points. Charging of Camera battery had become a bit difficult.

6. We had both Mosquito Coil as well as Mosquito Repellent in our stock. But we did not notice mosquito/insects coming inside the room.

7. We thought it would be better to carry basic medicines in case of necessity to cater urgent necessity. We also carried sufficient quantity of snacks to fill the stomach during drive.

8. We brought Dettol and spread it to the Toilet before use.

9. Check post for entry and exit to the Bandipur Forest Reserve area remain closed from 9PM upto 6AM. Hence for reaching the Guest House, we had to reach during daytime. Moreover, it was risky to travel the road during night.

Elephant family on the way to Kutta
Nagarhole Reserve Forest (Rajiv Gandhi National Park) is one of the most favourite destinations for nature-lovers in Karnataka. Forest Guest House, Nagarhole was located at the heart of the forest , near the place from where the Jungle Safari starts. I had inquired about the booking process and came to know that it was a lengthy exercise unlike the normal “On-line booking system” prevailing nowadays for selecting hotels.

I made a casual attempt and waited patiently for the response. To my luck it clicked and it was a delightful experience of spending two nights in the Guest House of Nagarhole along with my wife. I described the Booking process at the end of my blog in detail. Definitely, it requires patience unlike the lightening process we adopt nowadays for fixing our holiday program. But the end result will be fascinating and different from visiting the forest, staying in a private hotel.

9th July, 2016 - Saturday

My initial effort of booking thru Aranya Bhawan, Bangalore was not successful. On making a personal visit there I had been intimated to communicate Forest Department’s office at Mysore. I sent an e-mail to the address collected from Aranya Bhawan with
Deer herd in Nagarhole Forest
no response. I also contacted the Mysore Office as per the phone no collected from Bangalore. I was advised for sending a letter. I shot a letter by Speed-Post requesting to book a room in the Forest Rest House at Nagarhole on the 9th & 10th July, 2016. Additionally, I forwarded the scanned copy to the mail-address collected from Bangalore Office, but of no response.

In the first week of July, when I almost left the idea, there was a call from the Forest Department Office, Mysore confirming my request. I requested for a confirmation at least by SMS. But I had been told to go ahead with assurance that written confirmation was not necessary. When asked about the mode of payment for booking charges, I had been clarified that payment could be made at the spot itself.

Visiting a place without a written confirmation would be risky affair, particularly with my wife in a forest area with full monsoon. I was in two minds but could not leave the idea. On the previous day of my journey, I again contacted and received the re-assurance. I was also clarified that first day (9th July, 2016 Saturday) I had
Idli wrapped in Banana leaves - Kamat Hotel, Janapadalok
to be accommodated in the Ground Floor. Next day, I could occupy the room in first floor.

Route of the journey

Our destination was around 235 Kms from Bangalore. Our route would be Bangalore – Ramnagaram – Srirangapattnam – Hunsur - Veeranhosanahalli-Nagarhole. The name Veeranhosanahalli had been difficult to remember but important since that was our gateway for entering the forest via Honsur. After entry we would have to drive another 35 Kms to reach Nagarhole, where the Forest Office, Guest House etc were located. Jungle safari also started here (although closed now due to monsoon). Going further around 10 Kms from that place, the other end of the forest could be reached. This place was called Kutta.

Commencement of Journey

We decided to take the chance and started our journey. Our plan had been that if we did not get the accommodation, we would stay in a private hotel/homestay nearby.

As usual, our original plan of beginning early (to avoid the painful Bangalore traffic) did not materialise. We started at around 6.45 AM in the morning. I made another mistake of going thru KR Market - Mysore Road Flyover. That road after the
Glass balcony - Nagarhole Guest House 1st Floor
flyover was very crowded particularly due to ongoing Metro construction work upto Kengeri.

At 8 AM we halted at Kamat Hotel, Janapadalok near Ramanagaram for breakfast. Idly wrapped in banana leave was quite tasteful along with Vada and Coffee.

After an hour long journey, we reached the historical town of Srirangapatnam at around 10 AM. At further around 3.5 Km, we took a right turn to KRS Road. There was a crossing down another few kilometres. The right turn went to “Brindavan Garden”. We opted for left turn. On the way, we noticed a building named “Godfatherly Divine University”, really a name to watch. This portion of the road was not OK, with lot of potholes.

At around 10.40 AM, we finally reached Mysore-Medikari Road (NH 275) which proceeded towards Hunsur. Number of cycle vans selling fruits could be noticed after Bilikore. Fruits like Mangos, Apples were beautifully arranged like Pyramid in the Van, really worth noticing.

Entry to the forest

At 11 AM we touched Hunsur after crossing Bannikuppe. The gateway to the park called Veeranhosanahalli was around 22 Km from Hunsur. We took left turn towards DD Urs Road and then to State
IRUPU in spate
Highway 86. It was raining intermittently. School going children was seen on the road strolling merrily in groups ignoring the rain as well as our car. I was feeling guilty to break their joy by honking. But what to do, we had to move forward. Beautiful greeneries could be seen outside, as a pre-cursor that the forest was approaching. Two big resorts namely “The Jungle Inn” and “ Kings Sanctuary“ respectively could be seen here.

Finally when we reached the forest gate at 11.45 AM, heavy rain started.

Details of the vehicle, passengers were to be entered in the gate. This gate was closed at 6 PM in the evening and opened again next day at 6AM. No vehicular traffic was allowed between 6 PM to 6AM next day.

Forest Guest House (named Gangotri) is located around 38 Kms from this gate. Hereafter the entire journey was through the dense forest. I was driving slowly to enjoy the nature as well as to look for wild animals. We could see herd of deer in various places. Other animals were not visible, may be due to the intense rainfall. View of the forest was wet and mystic. Road
Angry cat pissing to my car
condition was ok. Sound of the friction of wheels in the wet road was clearly audible.

We stopped the car in between to hear the sound of the jungle. Chattering of birds or animals was almost muted except occasional calls. Rain was awesome and only its sound could be heard. There were number of caution boards throughout the road - not to stop the car, not to disturb the animals, Tiger Reserve area etc.

After around an hour we could notice some houses on the right side of the road. Thinking that was our destination I stopped the car but had come to know that the Forest Guest House was around 8 Kms from here.

Drive for the balance portion was more interesting. The road climbed higher thru the forest with twists and turns. I could see the variation in greeneries as well as its depth. Nature was so bountiful here. Almighty created this magnificent gift to the world with painstaking care spanning thousands of years. Density of the forest had further increased in certain places, as if the raindrops were not getting space to touch the earth, whereas in some areas there were very tall trees
Entry to Janapadalok
competing between themselves to touch the sky.

At last we reached our destination at around 2 PM. Forest was comparatively thin here. This is the place where the forest office, quarters of the forest staff, forest guest houses were located. I enquired about my reservation in the forest office. The concerned official had searched his register and I saw my name there with a sigh of relief.

No safari for wildlife viewing during monsoon

We had already been intimated by the Forest Office, Mysore that Wildlife Safari remained closed during monsoon. It would be resumed only during late September-early October when the monsoon would end. That was confirmed by this office.




Safari Charges were as follows :

i. For adults - Rs 300 per trip,

ii. For children below 10 years – Rs 150 per trip




Location of the Forest Guest House

Gongotri Guest House where we had been allotted for stay was located within few hundred yards from the forest office in a slightly inclined land from the roadside. There was ample space for car parking in front of the Guest House. This building was surrounded by forests except at the right side. Innumerable tall trees could be seen behind and the left of the Guest House. Thick jungles could be seen in the front portion after crossing the road. All the human habitats were situated at the right side. Overall it was an ideal place to feel, watch and enjoy the nature.



Condition of room
Entry point to Nagarhole Forest from Hunsur


Our allotment was in the ground floor for the first day. Two separate cots with mosquito nets, wardrobe, chair etc were provided. Toilet was quite good with hot water facility, European style Commode etc. There was a corridor in between two rooms. Dining arrangements, Dining Table with chairs were placed here. A small extension was on the front side equipped with chairs to relax, may be after food. Most interesting was an open spacious balcony. Overall it was much more than I expected. There was frequent power cut for which emergency lights were also provided.

Immediate requirement was to satisfy our appetite. Siddhappa was the room care taker. A smiling aged person, he asked us about lunch which we immediately consented. Rain stopped by the time and we were walking nearby areas eagerly waiting for food. Feeling impatient, we reached the canteen located far away from our abode. We saw Siddhappa carefully pouring our food to the tiffin carrier in the canteen. We came back and he was present within no time. He served us hot food which includes Rice, Roti, Pappar, Cabbage curry, Sambar and Rasam. Very simple but wholesome. We enjoyed his hot servings. Food charges
Forest Guest House Nagarhole
were @ Rs 70 per head.



Drive to Kutta & Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Tholpetty

We came to know about an alternative Jungle Safari for which we had to visit the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Tholpetty. The place although in Kerala but was around 20 Kms from Nagarhole via Kutta. At around 3.15 PM we started for Kutta and stopped at Nanchi Gate Forest Check Post at the end of the forest. Kutta was a small town at Kodagu District of Karnataka bordering Kerala. The road from Nagarhole meets the Tholpetty-Coorg Road at the Bus stand. We had to take left to reach Tholpetty.

Jungle Safari was confirmed and we purchased the ticket in a hurry. Ticket charges were Rs 268 for two, including Camera and parking. Additionally, Rs 600 had to be paid for hiring the jeep, which could accommodate six persons. Hence this cost would be apportioned based on the no. of persons boarded.

Before boarding the jeep at 4.45 PM, we came to know that the safari period would last for nearly one and half hour. By the time we could reach the check point at Nanchi for returning to our Guest House,
Majestic Mosquito net - Forest Guest House Nagarhole
it would be past 6 PM and the forest gate would be closed.



A helping hand by the counter guy

We intimated our concern to the ticket counter at Tholpetty. The counter person was an excellent guy. He had spoken to the Check post thru his mobile and confirmed that the Checkpost timing could not be relaxed. Apprehending the probable loss of ticket charges I requested him for return or give us opportunity next day. He agreed for the second option and told to show the ticket already purchased, next day, which would be sufficient.



An evening in the Balcony

We returned to the Guest House at around 6 PM. It was drizzling. Carrying our umbrellas we started grazing thru the deserted road. But controlling the umbrellas had been difficult due to high wind. We came back and occupied the open balcony.



Deer herd and Fireflies

As evening light was fading out and the surroundings were plunging into darkness, we noticed the deer herd walking around the tree branches. Sound of raindrops was becoming clearer while the forest became serene except occasional call of animals. There was intermittent
A large tree roots near to the Guest house
noise of barking deer, almost like mooing of cows.

Gradually, it was dense darkness except two lights, one in our room and another at a distance, may be at the Forest Office. Fireflies were flashing their lights in the darkness. The night here was un-bearably dark and acute. While flashing our torch we could see the burning eyes and pale shade of innumerable number of deers.

Around 8 PM suddenly we saw a huge herd of deer arriving near the open space in and around the Guest House. How many, I had no idea. It would be in hundreds, if not in thousand. They were all around us like ghosts. We could see their eyes only, if we switched on our torch.

When the rain and wind were at their heights, the jungle sounds were comparatively quiet. But when the rain subsided, insects and croaking chorus of frogs increased and become clearer. We became spellbound, that was the time for only listening the nature and the rain.

It was wet and cold in the open balcony with strong winds, where we were sitting. Moreover heavy rain started as the night progressed. We had no other choice
Entry Point Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary, Kerala
but to leave the balcony.




A dinner to remember

It was around 8.30 PM and a knock at the door. We were delighted to see Siddhappa entering with our dinner in the tiffin carrier.

He served the hot food of Chapatti with Dal, Cauliflower curry, Papad, Rasam. Enjoying food in such environment was unique and the satisfaction was inexplicable. My sincere regards to Siddhappa for his dedicated service to strangers like us.

We went to bed and the sleep was immediate. At midnight, in my sleep I could feel that rain shower further unleashed itself with gusty wind blows. It was really a terrific night.




10th July, 2016 – Sunday

I woke up early morning but there was no respite of rain outside. There seemed to be no possibility that it would stop. We dressed ourselves and came out to watch the flock of deers grazing nearby. I switched on my car and lazily proceeding towards Kutta. On the way we could see a herd of elephant crossing the road. Although not permitted, I could not restrict myself coming out of my car and watching them at a
Jungle of hotel signboards -way to Kabini
distance. They were busy in their own schedule and did not care for our presence.

We reached the Wayanad Wildlife Sanctuary and there was no difficulty to board the Safari Jeep showing the tickets we purchased yesterday but could not utilise. It was a trip of nearly one hour, but as expected we could not see much except a wild Gaur and a peacock and of course deers.




IRUPU waterfalls

Our next destination was around 9 Kms from the sanctuary. Irupu Falls was a popular tourist destination in Brahmagiri Range of mountains. For visiting Irupu Falls we had to go further from the Manchalli Bust stop (crossing point between nagarhole Highway and Tholpetty-Coorg Highway). We felt hungry but went on postponing the breakfast till we could locate a good restaurant. Around 1 Km from the Bus stop we had to take left turn. Having lost the energy to choose further, we stopped at a roadside restaurant near to the falls. Fortunately it was a good selection. We filled our empty stomach with kerala parota, Omlette, Coffee and washed our hands with rainwater falling from the tin shed. Rain escalated so heavily that it was
Elephant family from distance, Nagarhole
difficult to view properly while driving.



Fearsome and breathtaking during Monsoon

First view of the falls from quite a distance was a pale white patch coming thru the mountains. Gradually it became clearer coming between the green hills. A mystic and beautiful sight.

A beautiful Rameshwara temple was situated at the foothills and adjacent to the ticket counter.

Entrance fee was Rs 50 per person plus Rs 10 as Parking Charges. Karnataka state was blessed with wide varieties of falls all over the state. Monsoon was the best time to watch them. Initially there was a walk of around half a kilometre. We had to cross a wire bridge built on the stream originated from the falls. Next there was a climb around a hundred odd steps following the streams to reach the falls. There were dense forests in both sides. We noticed various boards erected by forest department informing various types of animals living in the Brahmagiri range. King Cobra the most poisonous snake in the world, could be found here. It appeared to be a popular trekking spot also. There were markings to help trekkers visiting to the top of the mountain.
Wild Gaur Wayanad Sanctuary, Tholpetty


From the foothills itself the roaring sound of the waterfalls could be heard. Nearer we were, we could watch the fury of tremendous force of water. Huge swelling flow at the peak of monsoon was coming down with high speed. Meanwhile the incessant rain started. When we reached very near to the falls it was difficult to distinguish between rain water and sprinkles coming from the falls. Umbrella was of no use because of wind speed. It was really awesome scene to watch. There was no question to take bath at the falls.

Although it was extremely risky, we saw various groups of young folks trying to reach the rocks in between the flowing water and take snaps dangerously. Only one person with a khaki uniform was politely endeavouring to prevent those boys but in vain.

When we came back we were fully soaked in water. We visited the Rameswara Temple. It was closed by that time, seemed to be under renovation.

Feeling hungry we began our journey back to the Guest House. But there was huge traffic congestion on the highway near to the bus stand due to a marriage ceremony probably of a wealthy
Wild peacock at Wayanad Sanctuary, Tholpetty
family. Hundreds, (if not thousand) of cars were parked in both sides of the street.




First floor of the Guest House

Today our booking was on the first floor. Siddhappa intimated that there was no other occupant on the first floor and hence we could occupy any of the two rooms. We entered the first floor climbing thru the wooden stairs made outside. We were delighted to see the interiors. Like ground floor, there was a hall in between two rooms. Dining tables with chairs and cupboards for crockeries were also similar. But added attraction was a balcony covered with glass equipped with sofa set and table.

There was a feeling of dampness and lack of natural light downstairs. But this place was open with full of natural light. Probably to support the feeling, the weather became clearer and sun peeped from the clouds for a while.

Condition of the room was better than the ground floor. One noticeable thing was that wire net had permanently been fixed in all windows, although they were open from outside. There was no scope for closing the windows by the boarders. This fixing was made probably
Safari Jeep Regiment, Waynad Sanctuary, Tholpetty
to prevent monkeys entering the rooms. However it had obvious disadvantages which we experienced at night.

We had a refreshing lunch with hot food brought by Siddhappa. He cautioned to close the doors properly giving no scope for monkeys to enter inside. I took it lightly while going down after lunch for few minutes. I was frightened to see two monkeys already entered inside the hall unlocking the hook. Somehow they came outside without any damage.




A frightening thunderstorm

At around 4.30 PM we came out. Our plan was to drive almost the two extreme ends of the forest. Initially we went towards the Nanchi Check Post near Kutta. While returning from there towards Hunsur Check Post, rain started once again. On the way we noticed a road inside the forest area indicating Farmadi Checkpost. We selected that road to proceed further. But with black clouds gathering all over the place, the downpour further aggravated with thunderstorm. There were lightening with cracking sound of clouds. Huge shower was affecting the visibility. Frightened, we had to stop the car in the lonely forest. Rain subsided in due course to some extent but continued unabated.
Breakfast at IRUPU Cafe near the waterfall
It was almost dark. We had to go back to the Guest House. Very few animals could be seen on the way except mostly deer, flock of Monkeys. A wild cat crossed the road in a fraction of a second.

Time for a sip in the tea cup. But Siddhappa, while serving lunch intimated he would go to his native place and would be substituted by another person. We walked to the Canteen which was far away from Guest House to have tea.




Night at the First Floor

Now the darkness plunged into the area. Compared to yesterday, there were hardly any tourist and very few vehicles today. There was no noise except the sound of nature. Todays feature was the sound of wind emanating from huge tree leaves nearby Guest House. Sometimes it was whispering and gradually increasing due to strong wind blows, almost as loud as landing of aircrafts. This sensation was un-heard from downstairs yesterday, may be due to heavy rain.

Balconies on the first floor were not having shades to protect from downpour. Flashing the torchlight, we could witness large no of deers very close to our car. It
Distant view of IRUPU Waterfall
was pitch dark, as if the whole world was plunged into darkness except this guest house and one or two lights far away.

We had an excellent dinner. It was an ordinary but hot and well served. But thereafter what we encountered, we were not prepared for that. Number of large and small insects already entered thru the open windows. We brought both manual as well as electrical “mosquito repellent” and both were operating. Despite our efforts we could not close the windows since all were sealed from inside. Both the cots were equipped with separate good-looking Mosquito nets. Somehow we entered inside but removing all the insects from inside was almost impossible. We had no option but to recognize their presence. It affected our sleep to some extent. As midnight approached further, I could hear the sound of tree leaves further strengthened due to strong wind blows. When I fell asleep I did not know.




11th July, 2016 – Monday

Return to Bangalore

Route : Kutta-Tholpettey-Bavali-Handpost-Mysore-Bangalore (Via Kabini)

I got up lazily since it was raining outside as usual. A new boy brought coffee and breakfast today. It was a nice
Entrance to climb steps towards IRUPU Falls
refreshment with hot idly and upma. At around 9.30 AM we started our return journey. We opted for a different route via Kutta-Tholpetty towards Kabini. Our drive was thru Coorg-Tholpetty Road which met Nagarhole road. Almost the entire journey was thru forest areas with occasional habitats in between. Before Kattikulam the route turned left towards Ananthsanthe.

At a place named Bavali (35 Kms from our starting point), we lost the route and re-entered to Nagarhole Reserve Forest once again thru another check post. Weather improved a lot today and un-willingly we re-entered the magnificent green Animal Kingdom once again. We could watch Elephants, deer, wild monkeys on the way. We were looking for the way towards Kabini. Lot of boards erected by numerous hotels and resorts could be seen on the way. Some of the boards were positioned more than 50 Kms away from the destination. At last, after enquiry from people, losing and again finding the way, we could see Kabini Reservoir from a distance. There was not enough time to proceed towards Kabini further.

Thru SH 86 at around 1 PM we reached a place called Handpost, a nice and unique name indeed. A bustling vegetable
A nice bridge to cross the stream towards IRUPU Falls
market was noticed immediately after a road crossing. We completed our delayed Sunday grocery marketing from that place. Rates were far cheaper than Bangalore except for cauliflower.

We had to take SH 33 from here to reach the Outer Ring Road of Mysore. We reached the Mysore-Bangalore Highway at around 3 PM and stopped at Fishland restaurant for lunch with Fish Curry, Dal Fry and Rice. We could reach home when the daylight was almost weaning.

How to Book the Guest House

1. I contacted the Karnataka Forest Department Mysore (Phone No. - 0821 2480901). I spoke to Mr Phanish of that office on several occasions, obtained confirmation and guidance regarding accommodation and route.

2. I also wrote to The Field Director, Project Tiger, Karnataka Forest Department, Aranya Bhawan, Asokapuram, Mysore - 570008 for booking of guest house as per preferred dates and forwarded mail. But as mentioned elsewhere, I did not get any reply to my communication.



Essential tips :

1. We carried Mosquito Coil as well as Mosquito Repellent. Both of them were extremely useful, not because of mosquitos but to protect from insects,

2. We carried two torchlights,
Night view from Forest Guest House
which immensely helped us at night.

3. There was no mobile connection during our stay (Airtel),

4. There were frequent power-cut, during our stay, although having emergency lights at important points. Charging of Camera battery had become a bit difficult.

5. We carried Umbrellas and Raincoats to negotiate with monsoon. Raincoats were of no use, but umbrella helped us a lot, except the period of downpour with high wind.

6. We thought it would be better to carry basic medicines in case of necessity to cater urgent necessity. We also carried sufficient quantity of snacks to fill the stomach during drive.

7. Check post for entry and exit towards Nagarhole Forest Reserve area remain closed from 6PM upto 6AM. Hence for reaching the Guest House, we had to reach during daytime. Moreover, it was very risky to travel the road during night.

8. For any emergency, the nearest place was Kutta, around 10 Kms from the guest house.

9. I found the nearest petrol pump after Tholpetty forest Jeep Safari Counter (around 20 Kms from the Nagarhole Guest House)

10. The objective of our visit was to feel, stay and enjoy the
Elephant labour
nature, hence I did not expect any luxury comfort or delicious menu which were not available here.

Wednesday 13th to Sunday 27th July – UK to Bangalore and back to the UK

Hi all,

The last time I wrote I was getting ready to leave for a return trip to the UK to renew my work visa…! Now I’m back in Bangalore but getting ready to leave to return to my job and life in the UK… I’m going home early J

If you’re a regular reader you’ll know that it’s not always easy and fun here for me…! I’ve had my fair share of dramas and challenges to overcome! It’s certainly been a test of my resilience and ability to live independently in a city on my own J I spent 12 days in the UK and my time there made me realise what was important to me at the moment. I really love India, the Indian people and life in India but I was not finding it easy to achieve some things that are important to me around working in India… like eating healthy (Indian food is healthy… I just didn’t have time to cook it!), exercising (just took too long to get to the gym… and I was reliant on my driver to go), spending time with friends and family (my working hours and where I was living weren’t conducive to making friends… I have Marcus and Elin but it wasn’t fair to rely on them and they will leave soon) and doing fun stuff (yes I’m in India and I see fascinating things every day… but it’s not the same when you don’t have someone there to share it with even occasionally and to do other fun stuff with).

One of my main problems was the traffic… I considered myself fortunate I didn’t have to drive in it (you need courage to drive in India!) and I tried to make the most out of the time I spent in it but taking 2 hours to go and do a 15-minute food shop when it’s 2km away… and 45 minutes to get to the gym when it’s 1km away wasn’t fun (I know I could walk… and I did sometimes… but not in the dark) and that’s on top of an already long working day. I admire the Indian people as they live with this daily and feel embarrassed that I found it so difficult. My Indian colleagues and I have shared our experiences of living and working in one another’s countries and we have come to the same conclusion albeit from different perspectives… This isn’t the same for everyone but typically in the corporate working world… in India the week is all about work because there’s very little time to do anything else around it; that makes weekends all about doing your jobs and spending time with your friends and family. In the UK we have more time during the week around work to do jobs and spend time with friends and family. I choose to live 30 minutes at most away from work and am fortunate that I can work flexibly so I have a lot of time in the evening outside of work. That time is precious to me, especially after it was filled with Uni during the last few years. I want to spend time with my friends and family in the UK who I have neglected in recent years (simply because I always had to make time for Uni). And I can see myself living abroad again at some point so will do it now whilst I don’t feel India is the right place for me.

There are lots of ifs and maybes about how things could have been different (Brian able to stay… more friends… less electrical issues!) but I’m completely happy with the decision and it also works for my company… so everyone is happy 😊 I have experienced living and working in India, loved interacting with the Indian people and have some amazing (and ridiculous!) stories to tell. I have lived in a lovely apartment (albeit it’s had its challenges recently!) in what I think is one of the nicest areas in Bangalore. There’s not many places in Indian cities where you can walk around quiet streets, just to enjoy it and go for dinner. I just can’t walk at night by myself.

My final week was interesting as I just wanted to get home and back settled. I didn’t want to get too emotional or sentimental about things so best thing for me is just get on with it and avoid situations where I might. I felt no need to go and do any souvenir shopping (my photos are my souvenirs, will turn them into something creative) or visit anywhere for a final time. I’ll be back to India, still haven’t see the Taj!

I had a new driver called Muragesh because Noor left when he dropped me off at the airport the other week. I knew he was leaving so it was hard saying bye because he’d been good to me, supportive and I’d been dependent on him for a lot of things (keeping me safe for one!). He had left for what he hoped was a better driving opportunity in which he would be his own boss and be able to spend more time with his family. I was pleased for him and impressed with his drive to achieve something different for himself. I may have contributed because we had a bit of a talk one day about his future and within 2 days he told me he was leaving… :/ I really hoped it worked out for him. He text me the day I arrived back in India just to make sure I had been picked up by the new driver J I immediately warmed to Muragesh, so eager to please and efficient. Dealing with people like Noor and Muragesh was another factor in my decision to leave… I’m too soft. Not in a way where I let them take advantage of me… I’m tough but fair like that… but in that I get too emotionally involved in things… like I felt it when I had to tell Muragesh I was leaving and not coming back because he’d seemed so pleased he had a regular person to drive for. The Indian people have really touched me… it’s the same in Uganda and places where you interact with them on a more real level… not just as a tourist. They remind me how special humanity is and how amazing the world is. To be honest at the moment I’m a bit too soft to deal with it here on my own. Muragesh told me his story the other day and I just admired him so much. The people don’t know and probably wouldn’t thank me for it (who am I to say who has it better) but I find it difficult and go around in circles about how I feel about the world and my place in it. I am now even more resolved to progress Believe In Better - www.bibetter.couk - the charitable trust I helped set up and am trustee of - that supports communities in Uganda (we have made some good progress recently and will hopefully be making a distribution of AFRIpads soon!) and who knows… it may expand to India one day.

My final few days at work were spent catching up with my boss (who has been really supportive about the move home, really lucky for her to have given me the opportunity to be in India), re-booked flights, working from home and telling the colleagues I needed to that I was leaving (I had some lovely messages back). Jane and Sharon knew I would be leaving but they didn’t expect it to be so soon but I will see them in the UK the week I get back J They’re amazing colleagues and now very good friends and I’m thankful I’ve been on this journey with them

I visited the three companies I had been working with in Bangalore. The journey to Whitefield that had caused me so much trouble (1 ½-2 ¼ hours each way) didn’t seem so bad the final time. It still took 2 hours one way but Muragesh went a different route to Noor so I saw something new of Bangalore. I was genuinely upset to say bye to these people and they seemed to feel the same. Some were very sad and I hadn’t realised how much of an effect I’d had. We’d enjoyed interacting with each other and many asked me if they could have done anything different to make my experience different. I reassured them not and I that I hadn’t had a bad experience… It would have been nice to stay longer to see if I could fix some things and I was going to miss out on friends visiting… but I was only going home because there were some things immediately important to me that Bangalore would not give me. They felt a bit upset that they hadn’t had much notice as had wanted to do me a lunch or something… the company I visited on Friday had a bit more time and had got me a lovely cake J

I spent Saturday chilling, going out for lunch at the nice healthy café I liked and then in the salon using up credit I had. I had a massage, my nails done and got my hair coloured… I’m not entirely sure what I was thinking with the hair colouring as I haven’t coloured my hair in years and didn’t need to now (other than wanting a change!) The least said about it the better and thankfully it’ll be fixed on Wednesday J In the evening Marcus and I went for dinner at Karavalli, the seafood restaurant at the Gateway Hotel. It was so nice! We sat outside in nice surroundings and the food was amazing… Indian style seafood! We missed Elin and Skyped her when we got back, I was really sad I hadn’t got to say bye to her but I think a trip to Sweden may be in order. I hope those two know how grateful I am for them and how much I appreciate their friendship.

I stayed up late Saturday night packing… felt a bit wary of the apartment because of the electrical issues and whilst nothing had exploded there were still flashing lights and random things happening. The air conditioning in my room wasn’t working so that made packing a bit of a workout. Sunday was spent clearing out and tidying the apartment. The maid hadn’t been in for a few days which made it a bit complicated and I had no idea what to do with the rubbish… The Security Guard helped me figure it out and I took down a lot of foodstuffs for them to save it being wasted. I had a bit of a moment with the Security Guard… with him saying ‘airport tomorrow’ and him shaking my hand and nodding… not much was said (we didn’t speak each other’s language) but it meant something to me as they’d looked after me too and I would miss them. It was simple things like seeing up delivery guys and supervising the handover of money. I knew I was in danger of getting emotional so I avoided them. I stopped in for tea with Marcus though, couldn’t not say bye to him.

Sunday night I got my final Inner Chef healthy takeaway! I wish they had something like that in the UK. My only bit of feedback is about the amount of packaging used (oh and that they put onions in a lot of stuff and there's no way of asking them not to)! I made sure everything was clean and tidy and chilled watching TV and debating with myself about whether I should pack and take home the £10 doormat I’d bought when I arrived. And receiving the odd random calls from people where you just say ‘hello’ to each other as despite the fact that both are speaking English nobody understands the other! I had to get some sleep before getting up again at 3.30am for the dreaded early 7am flight!

My next planned trip is in a few weeks to California. I don’t tend to write blogs for holiday trips so may not write again for a while…

Thank you for reading if you’re a regular. I write this for myself to remember stuff and for people who are genuinely interested… it rambles a lot so you’ve done well to stick with it! And the Facebook photos to go with this as suitably terrible and random…!

Lots of love

Dancing squirrel Hotel TTDC Madurai
I look for opportunities to open a new travelling chapter to enrich myself.

An assignment to Thiruvanathapuram provided the idea to drive my Hyundai Xcent from Bangalore and to visit nearby destinations on the way back.

Thiruvanathapuram (Trivundrum) is the capital city of Gods own country (i.e. Kerala) and located around 730 Kms from Bangalore.

We plan to cover the following places in our tour :

1. 1st day – Madurai,

2. 2nd day & 3rd day – Thiruvanthapuram (Trivundrum),

3. 4th day – Kanyakumari,

4. 5th day – Rameswaram,

5. 6th day – Back to Bangalore

My wife was my usual travel companion in all my driving adventure. This time my son would be accompanying us upto Trivundrum.




18.06.2016 DAY 1 – BANGALORE TO MADURAI (435 KMS)

Route – Bangalore-Hosur-Salem-Dindigul-Madurai (NH44)

Madurai is one of the large cities in Tamil Nadu and abode of rich Dravidian cultural heritage. The city has got historical significance spanning thousand years. Meenaksi Amma Temple is the most famous destination of Madurai.

I thought of commencing our journey in the early morning, but it was late as usual. Filling
Picturesque Landscape near Tirunelveli
up fuel and nitrogen in my car, withdrawal of cash etc were the pre-requisites. When we finally started it was already 10.30 AM. Next one hour was passed to negotiate with the busy Bangalore City Traffic. When we crossed the first Toll Gate (Rs. 45) of Electronic City Flyover and next Toll (Rs. 25) at Karnataka-Tamil Nadu border, it was around 11.45 PM.

Selecting the shortest que in a Toll gate

Selecting a particular que in a crowded Toll Booth with so many options was anybody’s guess. Both the toll gates were full of all kinds of vehicles in all the lanes. My wife believed to have power of guessing which lane would cost less time. Every time we had reached near any toll gate, she insisted to follow a particular que which I follow obediently without any contest. Sometimes the guess worked, sometime not.

This time she suggested to follow a que of trucks and transport vehicles, since other lines having passenger cars would consume more time. Unfortunately her guess did not materialise, since an ambulance reached with untiring sound in our adjacent lane and passed on the Toll Gate immediately followed by large no of
Land of windmills Tirunelveli
cars for free. Anyway this was only the beginning of Toll Gates and I hoped next time her anticipation would be fruitful.

Driving thru NH44

One of the un-avoidable attraction of my journey was to drive thru National Highway 44. This Highway started from Srinagar in Jammu & Kashmir and ended its journey to Kanyakumari, covering from extreme North to the last point of Southern India. This highway is a true symbol of national integration.

I love to drive thru this highway. In our earlier journeys to various places of Kerala and Tamil Nadu we travelled thru this highway. This six lane highway is a driver’s paradise and pleasure to move on.

We touched NH44 and a substantial portion of our journey today would be thru this highway. Intensity of traffic largely reduced after Hosur and we could increase the speed. Weather was cloudy and comfortable. The road between Hosur and Krishnagiri/ Dharmapuri was very scenic with surrounding hills in both sides. Cloud above the hills were reminding the onsets of monsoon. Car was smoothly cruising the highway and we were enjoying the surrounding beauty of nature.

At 12.45 PM we reached Paiyur after crossing
Refreshed Highway after rainfall
Krishnagiri Toll Gate (Rs. 60). There were large no of makeshift shops on the highway selling different varieties of mangos.

We stopped and collected a few after a brief research. The lady shopkeeper was extremely gentle and in the end gifted a piece extra. We enjoyed the gesture. She also carefully cut the mango into pieces and we enjoyed the taste. It was an offbeat different experience.

After crossing another Toll Gate (Rs 86) at Vellakal, we reached the beautiful Ghat Section near Salem. Broad roads took a twist and turn in various places. Nature was open and bountiful here with large no of hills on both sides of the road upto and after Salem standing under the black cloud. NH44 was proceeding amidst this beautiful landscape like a serpent, a wonderful experience of drivers. We encountered one more Toll Gate (Rs. 69) near Periyar University to reach Salem (200 Kms from Bangalore).

Lunch at Sree Saravana Bhawan Highway Branch, Salem

While entering Salem, we faced traffic congestion and decided to fill our stomach. We selected the above-mentioned hotel randomly and I must say we made the right choice. There are number of hotels with same
Kovalam Beach Thiruvananthapuram
name, sometimes with addition of prefix like “The” etc and it was easy to confuse.

Lot of people were patiently waiting to acquire a table. We could acquire a table after nearly half an hour. I selected “Southern Thali”, my wife “Gujarati Thali” and my son “Ghee roast Dhosa” respectively. In my thali, there were twelve bowls with different varieties of food and all of them were quite tasteful. Prices of food were quite reasonable. All of us enjoyed the splendid food to its best. I must mention that this restaurant was one of the star attraction of our journey.

Driving with full stomach

Usually I take light food during my drive, but this time I could not restrict my greed. My the stomach was full. Understanding the consequence I decided to reduce the speed of my subsequent drive. But despite my best efforts, I was feeling drowsy while driving.

Struggling with drowsiness while driving was a risky affair. At around 4.15 PM we had a brief coffee-break at Namakkal. In between I had to stop twice to thrash water to my eyes. While coffee re-energised me, dark clouds were gathering at the distant horizon. When
Entrance to Meenakshi Amma Temple Madurai
we reached Karur at around 5 PM heavy rain started. Madurai was still around 150 Km from here.

Rain, Rain, Rain

We closed the windows. Inside atmosphere was calm and quite. My son was in deep sleep. Torrential rains were pouring the highway outside. Few vehicles were plying on the road. Occasionally large body (carrying cars) were seen moving slowly. Some heavily loaded vehicles were struggling to move at snails speed.

Road was taking twists and turn in several places. Wide distant horizon and nearby hills were looking like a mystic painting. While driving carefully, I was enjoying the outside wet environment.

Intensity of rain subsided after some time and ray of sunshine peeped from the cloud. Thin line of distant hills appeared amidst the grey clouds. It was drizzling outside. NH44 was looking wet and afresh, glittering in the twilight sun. What a mesmerizing drive I was having.

Area of Colleges

On the way large no of educational institutions like Engineering College, Dental College, Nursing College were noticed on both sides of the road. Some of the colleges were very large in size and their buses were seen on the road.

While
Meenakshi Amma Temple Madurai
crossing Avarakurichi Toll Gate (Rs. 78) we recalled to take right turn from here in our earlier trip to Munnar and other places.

Latest toll gate (Rs. 53) was crossed near Kodai Road. Travellers visiting Kodai Canal had to take a turn from here (80 kms).

After Dindugal we noticed many Biriyani Hotels in one place.

Arrival at Madurai

At around 6.30 PM we reached the outskirts of Madurai. Now we had to take left turn to get NH 49 which went inside the Madurai City. This was a narrow and crowded road. After the loss of my Apple IPAD, GPS in my mobile was my only guide. But due to faulty connectivity it failed to direct in several occasions. Locating a place in a big crowded city like Madurai, particularly after nightfall without GPS help was not easy.

Booking at TTDC 2, Madurai

Our room was booked at TTDC-2(Tamil Nadu Tourism Development Corporation). There were two TTDC hotels in Madurai i.e. TTDC I & II in different locations. Nevertheless, after all these road hangover when we reached the hotel, we came to know that was TTDC I and not TTDC II where we
Green View from Balcony TTDC Hotel Madurai
had booking. It took another half an hour to finally locate our hotel, TTDC II.

Rooms are quite spacious and equipped with essential amenities required in a budget hotel, reasonably clean toilet and above all tariff was quite reasonable (Rs. 1095 for a non-AC double bedded room with complimentary breakfast).

History of the temple

Menakshi (Fish-eyed) Amma temple is the crowning glory of the Southern India temple architecture. This beautiful temple is the abode of Goddess Parvati, wife of Lord Siva. As per legend, after waging war for conquering three worlds (Heaven-Earth and Hell) when the goddess finally reached and looked to Lord Siva, she could recognise him as her destined husband. Both of them came back to Madurai for marriage.

The original temple believed to have been built during 6th century BC, was destroyed during early 14th century by the Army of Sultan Alluddin Khilji. The temple was re-built during the 16th Century by the Nayakar Kingdom. The temple has 14 Gopurams covering all sides in a vast land area.

Temple darshan timing:

a. Morning – 5 AM to 12.30 PM,

b. Evening – 4 PM to 9 PM.

Dress Code
Vivekananda Rock Kanyakumari
:

i.Shoulders, legs are not be exposed.

ii.Shorts, caps are not allowed.

Our visit to the temple

Immediately after check-in, we came out to visit Meenakshi Amma Temple, nearly 3 Kms from the hotel. Here, we made a mistake to take our car for the temple visit. Roads in and around the temple were very narrow and heavily crowded with all kinds of vehicles and pedestrians. Moreover, the car parking area of the area was the only place to park the car, all other nearby places being fully occupied. After wasting more than an hour we could locate and park our vehicle in the temple parking. Ultimately, when we entered the temple it was around 8.30 PM.

We kept our Camera, mobile inside the car and shoe in the stall adjacent the entrance gate. Fortunately there was not much crowd. Unlike in other well-known temples of South India, I did not observe strict adherence of dress code while standing in the que. As usual there was lack of discipline near the shrine. Everyone was pushing others to stand in front of the deity and pray as long as possible. We were delighted to have darshan
Pamban Bridge Rameswaram
of the goddess.

Procession to carry Lord Sundareswar to the Goddess before the temple closes at night

As per the rituals, every evening before closing of the temple the shrine of Lord Sundareswar (Shiva) was brought to the bedroom of the goddess to spend the night at the temple and taken back in the early morning. We were lucky to observe the procession carrying the Lord to the temple. Fortunately there was not much crowd to observe the same.

We left the temple at around 10.15 PM. Looking to feel our stomach, but most of the shops were closed. Somehow we managed our hunger with some street food.

Since that was not enough I consumed two mangos purchased on the way after returning to our hotel. Feeling extremely tired and exhausted I went to a deep sleep.



DAY 2 - 19TH JUNE, 2016 – SUNDAY – MADURAI TO THIRUVANANTHAPURAM – 315 KMS

Route – Madurai-Tirunelveli-Panakudi-Nagarcoil- Thiruvananthapuram

A warm and gentle early morning

I woke up early in the morning by the ringing of Alarm Clock attached to my mobile. It was a sound and un-interrupted sleep last night. The hotel
Ruins of Church Ghost Town Dhanuskodi
was constructed in a large area. There was a big courtyard and a garden within the hotel space. There was a beautiful balcony adjacent to the room. Three big trees in the garden located very near to the balcony were accommodating no of squirrels and varieties of birds.

I spent some time in the balcony watching the busy activities of squirrels and birds. Thereafter I decided to visit the Meenakshi Amma temple once again in the morning.

Journey to Thiruvananthapuram

At around 10.30 AM we began our journey to Thiruvananthapuram. Climate was quite hot and humid. Today’s trip was again thru NH 44 further down to the south. Once again the GPS was troubling. When we touched NH44 thru NH 49, it was around 11.30 AM. There were three Toll Plazas between Madurai and Tirunelveli i.e. Madurai (Rs 62), VirudhuNagar (Rs 65) and Salaipudur (Rs. 75) respectively. At around 1 PM we reached Tirunelveli.

Tirunelveli – A place of Windmills

One of the important landmark after Tirunelveli was large number of rotating Wind mills. There were thousands of windmills spread across both sides of the road. India is one of the leading producer of wind
Panoramic view of Kanyakumari
energy and a substantial portion of the wind power was generated in and around this place. Reason for the phenomenal growth of the windmill was the high wind blowing in this area.

It was a worm and sunny day. Gradually tall mountain ranges emerged in the distant horizon. Nearby hills are filled with green bushes. Huge coconut, banana orchards were visible on the roadside. Overall landscape was magnificent and it was a real pleasure to drive.

I stopped the car in between, to enjoy the bounties of nature and take few snaps. Also the power of wind blow could be felt as if anything loose would fly immediately.

Another noticeable feature was the presence of Car Show Rooms immediately after Tirunelveli. Almost all leading car brands established their showroom here. Reason I do not know. Possibly this indicated the relative prosperity of this area.

Right turn towards Thiruvananthapuram

Near Panakudi (Kanyakumari was around 30 Kms from here), we took a right turn to catch NH 47B leaving NH44 towards Thiruvananthapuram. It was around 2.20 PM in the afternoon. Before that we passed the last toll plaza (Rs. 60) near Nangunneri.

Driving thru narrow highway
Beautiful turning at NH 44 with Mountain view


Driving thru NH 47B was a sharp contrast to the drive thru NH 44. This was two lane road passing thru Nagercoil to Thiruvananthapuram (around 100 Kms from Panakudi). Road was extremely busy with full of traffic throughout the journey to our ultimate destination. Road passed thru several busy areas (both in Tamil Nadu and subsequently in Kerala) and in all these places traffic congestion was a big pain. In fact driving in National Highways of Kerala was tough due to the narrowness of road. This problem I faced during my earlier journeys to Kerala also.

It took nearly three hours to reach Thiruvananthapuram crossing just around 100 Kms.

Hotel KTDC, Chaitram, Thiruvananthapuram

We booked our accommodation in Hotel KTDC, Chaitram, a Government of Kerala owned hotel (Tariff Rs. 1183 for Non-AC Double bedded room with complimentary breakfast, booked thru Make my trip). Hotel was located in Thampanoor at the heart of Thiruvananthapuram city.

Outside look, reception and the lift of the hotel were good to give a good impression which was entirely deceptive. Condition of the room allotted to us at the fifth floor was extremely poor. The room was shabby, walls full of
Roaring seawave Kanyakumari
dampness. Both the room as well as the toilet were not clean. Towel provided was dirty and became disfigured due to prolonged usage. One mosquito repellent was provided without any repellent oil. There was no hot water coming in the shower. Bedsheets were not changed regularly. Response of the front office desk of the hotel was extremely poor. They were determined not to listen to any plea of the boarder. We had to stay in that hotel for two days and I must mention that the hospitality standard of this hotel was one of the worst I have ever seen anywhere. Moreover there was no service provided on the second day (not even complimentary one bottle of Mineral water) of our stay. However we could not change to any other hotel since we paid in full tariff in advance thru Make-my-Trip.

Sunday evening was spent on our personal engagements. In the evening rain started and gradually the intensity increased. At night, we had dinner at a nearby restaurant.




DAY 3 – 20TH JUNE, 2016-MONDAY -THIRUVANANTHAPURAM

Visit to Padmanabhaswamy Temple

Today we planned to visit two destinations, first Padmanabhaswamy Temple and then to Kovalam
Windmill Tirunelveli
Beach. The temple was located nearby but having the Madurai experience of car parking difficulties, I was sceptical whether we would drive or not. Fortunately, we had no problem here. The locals near the parking lot helped us to park our car.

History of the temple

This temple was dedicated to Lord Vishnu. History of the temple dated back to eighth century AD. It is one of the sacred Vishnu temples in India. Lord Vishnu is enshrined in the Ananthasayanam posture, the eternal yogi sleep on the serpent. Main idol of Sree Padmanahaswamy is about 18 Ft long and can be viewed through three main doors. Maharaja of Trivancore is the trustee of the temple. It is the richest Hindu temple of the world.

Thiruvananthapuram, the capital city of Kerala takes its name from the presiding deity of the Sree Padmanabha Swamy temple, who is also known as Anantha (one who reclines on the Serpent Ananatha). The word 'Thiruvananthapuram' literally means - the land of Sree Anantha Padmanabhaswamy.

Strict Dress Code

I read about the strict dress code requirement for devotees in this temple. Hence I kept my shirt, banyan, camera, mobile etc
Observation Tower kanyakumari
inside the car. We brought two dhotis for wearing inside the temple. My wife wrapped her Salwar Kamij with a dhoti. Wearing a dhoti I entered the temple premises with my trouser in hand along with my wife. However, we could not succeed even after all those preparations. I was told to leave the pant in the nearby counter and come with purse in hand. I obediently followed the same. This time we succeeded. We could enter the temple.

Darshan timing

Temple opens in the early morning at 3.30 AM and remains open upto 12 Noon in the morning session. However, there are 30 minutes to one and half hour gap in between. During those periods darshan remain suspended. Darshan again started at 5 PM and remain open upto 7.20 PM with a gap of half an hour in between.

Our Darshan

We entered at around 11.15 AM, next darshan timing would start at 11.45 AM. One noticeable thing is that the idol of the Lord in the Black Stone is huge and need careful watch to have a proper darshan. Some time is required to adjust our eyesight with the dim light of the Grabhagriha.
Pamban Road Bridge Rameswaram
Luckily, there was not much crowd and huge congestion in front of the deity and we had an excellent darshan of the Lord.

Kovalam Beach

This destination was the next choice. It was slightly far away from our hotel. When we reached it was raining. I did not find anything special here. It was just like any other sea beach. Both of us were feeling hungry and looking for seafood at a reasonable price. Randomly we selected an eating place on the beach. It was an ordinary restaurant. We were treated very well by the shopkeeper and briefed about varieties of seafood available. But when asked about the price he started from Rs 1500/- for just a plate of Prawn Curry with Rice (despite being a off-season). We were about to leave the hotel but after several round of negotiations it was finalised at Rs 600/-. Our hunger prevented us to go anywhere else.

I noticed this tendency to levying exorbitantly for ordinary services rendered, in various tourist destinations of the “Gods own country”. My experience was that Kerala being the place for wealthy travellers with deep pockets, not for people like us who look for basic
View of Indian Ocean, Dhanuskodi
facilities at reasonable cost.

Poovar Island

From Kovalam we decided to visit Poovar island. This place was in the outskirts of the city (about 25 Kms) and was an attractive tourist destination, famous for its backwaters, confluence of Neyyar river meeting the Arabian Sea and also the sea beach. The road going to Poovar was narrow and it was an hours ride. This place was beautiful with greeneries everywhere. There is a similarity with backwaters of Alleppy or Kumarakkom, which we visited earlier.

We thought of a backwater boat ride and inquired the rate. To our dismay the rate started with Rs 2000 per hour (off season rate) with an offer of negotiated price upto Rs 1500. We left the idea and came back to the city.



DAY 4 – 21ST JUNE, 2016-TUESDAY - THIRUVANANTHAPURAM TO KANYAKUMARI (90 KMS)

Journey to Kanyakumari

Our next destination was the southern-most point of India, Kanyakumari. Three oceans, Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea were meeting the mighty Indian Ocean here.

Kanyakumari was around 90 Kms from Thiruvananthapuram. Our route would be thru Salem-Kochi-Kanyakumari Highway (NH 47).

We started at 9AM after having the
Fishing boats View from Pamban Road Bridge rameswaram
complimentary breakfast. I was short of liquid cash and thought of drawing the same from an ATM on the way. Unfortunately, my repeated attempts proved futile, since wherever I attempted there was no cash. Mobile GPS was troubling as usual, that was a double whammy.

I was trying in SBI and SBT ATM. At last I could draw the required cash from an HDFC Bank ATM in the fourth attempt.

NH 47 was a two lane highway. The road was heavily crowded with all kinds of vehicles. Moreover it passed thru number of small and mid-sized, busy towns making the drive very time consuming. Amongst all the vehicles on this road, the agility and skill of negotiating crowded streets by the Red Colour State Government Buses were noticeable.

We reached at Nagercoil at around 11.45 AM. Kanyakumari was around 20 Kms from here. Thereafter the environment became quiet and lonely. Backwater could be seen nearby. We entered Kanyakumari at around 12.15 PM.

TTDC Hotel Kanyakumari

We booked a NON-AC Room in TTDC Hotel at Kanyakumari (Tariff Rs. 1450). This hotel was located at the sea-shore and best located in Kanyakumari at reasonable price. Covering a
Bus sailing thru sea water Dhanuskodi
vast land and wide variety of rooms, this was arguably the best place for staying at Kanyakumari. Lighthouse was also located in the same compound.

We were allotted a sea-facing room in the ground floor. Room was reasonably spacious and there was also a small room in between the toilet. It was very clean and equipped with all required facilities. Additionally there was a splendid sea-facing balcony.

We had two must see places in mind, Kanyakumari Devi Bhagavathy Temple and Vivekananda Rock. Temple would open at 4 PM, thus we planned to visit the temple in the evening.

Vivekananda Rock

Our available time was short. Hence immediately after check-in, we rushed to the jetty for visiting the Vivekananda Rock. It was off-season, hence there was not much rush. Ferry charge was Rs 34/- per head.

Vivekananda Rock was around 500 Mtrs from the Indian Main Land and was the southern-most point. Entry fee was Rs 20/- per head. Before proceeding to World Religious Conference at Chicago, Swami Vivekananda meditated in this rock alone for three days.

This had been my third visit to the rock and every time my appreciation to this place was
A strange old man Dhanuskodi
rejuvenated. Most interesting was the meditation hall inside the temple. We sat there for a while and tried to concentrate the “OM” emblem glowing in the darkness.

The place was maintained by Vivekananda Kendra. List of major donatees were encrypted in the wall. I saw the name of Amitabh Bachhan, who donated Rs 11 Lakh being the highest contribution of all names.

Another interesting aspect was the three different colours of the water distinctly visible, light grey and deep grey in both sides of the rock and blue colour in the distant Indian Ocean. On return we also visited the statute of Thiruvalluvar erected in the adjacent rock. TTDC opened a restaurant below the statute.

I felt hungry and looking for hotels serving Bengali food. In my last visit around 15 years ago, there were large no of such hotels on the seashore. But the nos were drastically reduced now. Instead, large no of restaurants have come up selling different varieties of food ranging from Punjabi, Marwari, Gujarati, leave alone South Indian food. At last we could a locate a Bengali hotel. It was late afternoon, I thought of trying our dinner here.

Gandhi Memorial Hall
Saltmaking tanks near Tuticorin


Weather was warm and humid. We entered Gandhi Memorial Hall. The Gatekeeper took us inside and started describing history of the place. After the lecture, at a stretch he fervently requested for donation. I gave Rs 20, he seemed to be not satisfied but accepted it.

Next was the Kamaraj Memorial. Historically important but the faded glory was prominent in that hall.

Kanyakumari beach

Kanyakumari beach was next in the list. This was the last point of Indian land meeting three oceans i.e. Bay of Bengal, Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. A prominent Board reminded “to be cautious since many people lost their lives here”. Despite that many people (even children) were taking bath at that place.

We came back to hotel for a tea break. Drizzle started and we were enjoying the panoramic view of the sea and the rainfall taking sip in the tea cup from the hotel balcony.

Observation Tower

An observation tower was erected almost inside the sea. This tower was located just in front of the sea facing side of our hotel. Since it was raining, going to the Sunset Point was not worthwhile, being far away from
Lighthouse Kanyakumari
here. Instead I went to that Observation Tower.

Meanwhile the intensity of rain increased and weather deteriorated. I stopped in the lower balcony of the tower to feel the stormy sea. Sea was rough and height of wave increased. Lot of crabs were climbing the nearby rocks. Splashing sprinkle of roaring sea-water soaked my clothes. I was thrilled and took some snaps.

Instead of steps there was a walkway to climb to the top of the five storey tower. Panoramic view of the swelling sea waves striking the sea shore were really fascinating.

Kanyakumari Devi Bhagavathy Temple

This famous temple (Devi Parvati or Durga) was one of 51 Sakthi Peeth as per Hindu Mythology. Devi Kanyakumari was popularly known as Devi Bhagawathy, Durga or Parvati. As directed by his guru Ramakrishna Paramahansa, Swami Vivekananda worshipped here to seek devi’s blessings.

Temple opens at 4 PM in the afternoon upto 8 PM.

I heard about strict Dress Code required for entry in the temple. Based on our experience in Thiruvananthapuram, we came prepared without banyan and wrapped in dhoti, but surprisingly there was no strict restriction, may be due to thin crowd. We had a
View from Balcony TTDC Hotel Madurai
nice darshan of the goddess.

Dinner we had in a Bengali Hotel (named Sonar Bangla Hotel) with Fish Curry and Rice. Food was delicious and reasonably priced.



DAY 5 – 22ND JUNE, 2016 - WEDNESDAY – KANYAKUMARI TO RAMESWARAM (310 KMS)

Route : Kanyakumari-Tirunelveli-Thoothukudi-Valankani-Ramanathpuram-Rameswaram

Rameswaram was not in our original plan since we were hard pressed to return Bangalore by Thursday afternoon. Nevertheless, having reached to Kanyakumari we thought of not missing one of the most revered holy place of Hindus in India, Rameswaram.

Early morning I rushed to the “observation tower” for observing the sunrise. But sun god peeped behind the clouds for a while and vanished thereafter.

Serving of complimentary breakfast was slightly delayed. Last night we noticed two buses arrived at the hotel packed with visitors. Whether they were the reason for delay in preparation of breakfast, I am not very sure.

We started at around 9 AM. Very soon we reached to the starting point of Srinagar-Kanyakumari Highway (NH44). From this point the longest Indian Highway (3750 KM) began its journey to the northern corridor of India. This journey upto Tirunelveli was splendid and worth remembering. Nearby
Green view from Balcony TTDC Hotel Madurai
hills, coconut and banana plantation on both sides of the road, mountain ranges in distant horizon created a scenic view in the morning sunshine.

Route to Rameswaram from Kanyakumari

1.Kanyakumari to near Tirunelveli (72 Kms)

One toll gate (Rs 60) was passed. Just before Tirunelveli (72 Kms from Kanyakumari) we took a left turn to get the NH 138 which moved to the right below the highway flyover.

2.Around 50 Km from NH 44 upto Thoothukudi thru NH 138 and then to take left turn

NH 138 was a two lane but excellent road with newly led tar. Landscape changed dramatically and white salt making waterbodies were seen miles after miles wherever we looked. We stopped for a while to take snaps, tasted the salt. It was like chewing the dust with salty taste. Not very interesting I must say.

We passed the outskirts of Tuticorin City. Lot of factories were seen on the roadside.

3.Around 12 Km in NH 38 after taking left turn and then to take right turn to catch the East Coast Highway (State Highway 49) at Vellankani

Rameswaram was around 200 Kms from here. In between we
Kovalam Beach Thiruvananthapuram 2
crossed two Toll Gates (Rs 55 +Rs 60).

4.Around 120 Km in East Coast Road upto Ramanathpuram

This was also a two lane road and moderately maintained except few places. At a small place called Vember we dropped for a lavatory and tea break. Road was almost empty, but a good place for cow grazing. While driving we usually place importance to humans and vehicles but sometimes ignore animals. Immediately thereafter an incident occurred for which I was not prepared.

Clash with a cow

I was tempted to increase the speed. Suddenly I noticed a cow crossing the road very slowly. I pressed the horn but it ignored and paused almost at the middle of the narrow road. Having no other alternative I pressed the brake and was able to move my car to the left. I escaped the collision narrowly but not without damage. The right hand mirror of the car hit the horn of the cow and was completely broken. I paid the price for ignoring animals on the road.

5.Taking right turn at Ramnathpuram to NH 87 towards Rameswaram (56 Km)

At around 1 PM we took a right turn to
Temple at Vivekananda Rock
touch NH 87. This road was coming from Madurai and we had to drive another 56 Km from here. This was a wide and well maintained road. Vagai river was seen on the left side after a while. Coast Guard points were seen on the roadside. Around 20 Kms before Rameswaram the railway line could be seen and was accompanying us upto Pamban Bridge.

Pamban Bridge

Before the bridge, we were stopped in a Toll Gate (Rs. 60). After a while the famous Pamban Bridge was seen. This railway bridge and the parallel road bridge were connecting the Pamban island (where Rameswaram was located) with the mainland. The railway bridge constructed over the sea more than a century old was considered an engineering marvel. Also it was shown as one of the ten most dangerous Railway Bridges in the world (particularly during monsoon or cyclonic storm when the sea was rough) in National Geographic Channel regularly. Middle portion of the bridge could be raised for movement of ships.

We stopped our car midway through the road bridge. It was a sunny afternoon. No train was running through the bridge. Sea looked greenish with hundreds of fishing vessels
Sea view from TTDC Hotel Kanyakumari
in varieties of colours all over the place. Two bridges are standing separately side by side, but comparatively the road bridge was longer and also bigger both in size and height from the sea. Height of the railway bridge was quite low from the sea (as if the bridge was floating on the sea). The bridge looked to be quietly standing on the sea. We noticed five peacocks roaming on the railway bridge.

TTDC Hotel Rameswaram

We entered Rameswaram town at around 2 PM. Roads inside the town was narrow and full of traffic. We spent some time to locate our destination TTDC Hotel, Rameswaram. Like any other TTDC Hotels, this hotel was located in the most prominent place of this town, i.e. near the temple and on the sea shore. Hotel area was quite spacious with different varieties of rooms.

We booked a Non-AC room for a night. A room on the second floor was allotted. The room was not ok. Both the room as well as Toilet were dirty. Cot and Bed-sheet were not cleaned for a long time. Windows were broken. A substantial portion of the wall was covered with dampness. Most interesting was
Parking space Dhanukodi Check post
the Television where only few dotted lines were visible. A bad room to stay but we thought of not wasting time looking for alternatives since we have to start towards Bangalore tomorrow early morning.

Dhanuskodi

If we see the Indian map, a thin land line is spread between the oceans from Rameswaram towards Srilanka and stops at Dhanuskodi. Indian territory ends here and Srilanka was around 30 Kms from here crossing Palk straits of Bay of Bengal.

We decided to go Dhanuskodi first and visit the Ramanathaswamy Temple in the evening. Distance between Rameswaram and Dhanuskodi was around 20 Kms. We came to know from the hotel that we would be allowed to drive upto around 12 Kms. Thereafter we had to take the minibus ride (Rs 150 per head).

After a quick lunch, we started our journey. Crossing the town we reached NH 87 once again which would lead us to Dhanuskodi. This newly tar laid four lane highway was excellent and well maintained. There was hardly any vehicle on the road. I was tempted to increase the speed. Suddenly we saw the sea initially far away and after some time almost touching the road
Peacock st treetop Dhanuskodi
on both sides. It was a totally different experience.

Car parking in Dhanuskodi Ckeckpost

Near the check post there was a parking area. Our drive ended here. There were bus services too from Rameswaram to the Dhanuskodi Checkpost. We had limited time in hand and hence boarded the Minibus immediately for undertaking the balance portion of our journey. The driver was a young guy. Starting from the highway, soon he departed it and steered the bus to the thick Sand on the seashore. We were amazed to see that the bus came down to the sea and the rest of the journey was on the sea water. Probably it was a backwater and the sea was only knee deep. Nevertheless it was an amazing drive. We could see only sea water in all sides of the bus. Our trip continued for nearly an hour and ultimately we reached Dhanuskodi.

A Ghost Town

Dhanuskodi was called a Ghost Town. There was a rail link earlier which was fully destroyed in a devastating cyclone occurred around fifty years ago. Thousands of people died in that tragedy. Before that incident, Dhanuskodi was an important town linking between India and
Sea Beach Dhanuskodi Indian Ocean side
erstwhile Ceylon. Deserted ruins of Railway Station, Post Office, Church and other places still reminds us about the glory of the past.

The road after the Check post, although not allowed for private drive, also looked to be good and motor able. On the way thru our Minibus trip, we noticed several two wheelers and trucks carrying loads going towards Dhanuskodi even after crossing the chek post. Due to its proximity to Srilanka, this road seemed to become strategically very important. Work in the under construction road upto the last point of Dhanuskodi was going on in full swing and seemed to be completed within a short period.

A holy place with breathtaking beauty

Religious importance of Dhanuskodi was paramount. As depicted in Ramayana, Lord Rama built the “setu”(bridge) from the last point of Dhanuskodi to Srilanka to conquer Ravana and bring back Sita.

The sea beach was wonderful and pleasant. Walking few kilometres we could reach to the area where the “Bay of Bengal” was on the left side and “Indian Ocean” on the right side.

Compared to blue and violent Indian Ocean, Bay of Bengal was greenish and quiet.

There were some
Toll Gate near Dindugal
shops set up by local villagers selling tea and snacks. This memorable adventure ended in the late evening when we came back to the check post from where we began our voyage. I must mention the driving skill of our bus driver and the care he took while driving his vehicle within thick sand and sea water. Overall it was an unforgettable experience.

A narrow escape

When we started our return journey it was almost dark. Highway was dark and empty. Moreover a dusty layer engulfed on the car windscreen affecting the visibility. My wife told me to clean it. Physically tired I ignored the advice which proved very costly.

I started slowly but gradually increased my speed since the road was excellent. It was totally dark and almost without any vehicle. I switched on the headlight and started driving in a tired and relaxed manner. Suddenly there was a huge jerk and I felt the car had been speedily moving rightwards of the road. I lost the control, applied the brake but it did not appear to have worked. The car almost turned ninty degree within fraction of a second, to hit the road culvert and on the verge of plunging into the backwater just outside the road. Just within inch of the culvert the car stopped.

Entire incident happened within a minute. Our first reaction was whether we were still alive. We realised that we were. We missed a big accident by a whisker.

I came out of the car and saw that this portion of the road was under construction. Stonechips were only laid without tar. Possibly while driving at speed the wheels skidded when I applied the brake and the car lost balance. During our onward journey to Dhanuskodi in daylight I noticed this portion of the highway but on return it was not visible in the darkness. The entire area was totally dark and there was no vehicle on the road.

Thanking the almighty we resumed our journey. By 7 PM we reached our hotel. A brief refreshment and then we prepared for our visit to the Ramanathaswamy Temple.

Ramanathaswamy Temple

This was one of the holiest temple worshiped by Hindus and one of the char dhams located in four corners (others are Puri, Dwarka and Badrinath) of India. Lord Siva was worshiped here by Rama here along with Sita.

There was not much rush since this was not tourist season. It was a nice and peaceful darshan. Pilgrims all over India gathered here to offer puja and chanting prayers to the lord. We saw a big group of housewives (possibly from North India) chanting songs and mantras praying for blessings from the lord.

We purchased Holy water and Prasadam from the temple counter. The temple corridor was the largest of all Hindu temples, well decorated and worth seeing.

We came out at around 9 PM and finished dinner from a nearby restaurant. We could not resist thinking of the terrible incident we faced in the evening and possible consequences which we narrowly escaped. Once again it reminded us the preciousness of life.



DAY 6 – 23RD JUNE, 2016 - THURSDAY – RAMESWARAM TO BANGALORE (600 KMs)

Route - Rameswaram-Ramanathapuram-Madurai-Dindugal-Salem-Bangalore

Due to certain unavoidable pre-occupation, we were to reach Bangalore within 4 PM, Thursday. We started at 5 30 AM. We had to cover around 600 Kms within little more than 10 hours.

We touched NH 87 very shortly. This highway went straight to Madurai which was around 170 Kms from here. It was still dark and cloudy. I was maintaining comfortable speed with increased caution remembering the horrific incident we had yesterday. When we touched the Pamban Bridge, the morning light was emerging from the darkness. Innumerable dots of light from the fishing boats were still visible on both sides of the bridge. It was a pleasing sight.

Covering around 50 Kms we reached Ramanathapuram. Next at least 100 Kms road broadening work was going on to make it a four lane highway. Driving speed had to be moderate to negotiate several diversions and narrow portion in certain areas.

We entered Madurai by 8 AM. Once again we lost our way in between the roads of the city due to malfunctioning of the GPS in our mobile and lost precious time. Finally when we reached NH 44, it was around 9.30 AM.

Rest of the journey was a smooth drive. With brief stops in between we could reach Bangalore within our target i.e. by 4 PM.

Total distance travelled was 2060 Kms. Petrol consumed was around 135 Ltrs.




Approx. Total cost :

1. Hotel Charges – Rs 6400

2. Petrol - Rs 9200

3. Toll - Rs. 1400

4. Food - Rs 4500

5. Misc expenses – Rs 3000



Total - Rs 24500

I use this blog to remember things and keep my family and friends up to date on what I’m doing… anyone is welcome but you’ll find it ramblings nonsense if you don’t know me J





Sunday 16th May – Bangalore



I arrived back from Delhi and was very happy to see Noor waiting for me J We got sorted and planned the rest of the day… first stop was the Marriott hotel in Whitefield to collect some new work paraphernalia… it was nice to catch up with Chris and Pete who had arrived that morning (Chris for a week, Pete for 3 weeks). They then helped me do my food shopping in Hypercity and carried it to Noor and the car for me!



Back at home I got settled in. It was my first time back to the apartment on my own. I missed Brian but it wasn’t too bad although Usha had been far too efficient and washed things I didn’t want her to, like the old t-shirt Brian always leaves for me grrr. I ordered take out and focused on Uni… had a lot to do!





Monday 17th to Friday 20th May – Bangalore



It was a busy week with work, we had an event in Bangalore which meant I spent a lot of time working and not a lot of time essay writing but it was really nice to have my colleagues in town. I had to resort to takeaway a few times… but the good thing here is that you can order pretty much anything and much of it can be made healthy. I also stayed and ate at the JW Marriott in UB City for a team dinner which was really nice and meant I got a swim in a pool. Markus and Elin invited me out to dinner one evening, so we walked to a north Indian restaurant on 80ft road. That was REALLY good. I’m always feeling guilty about not studying when I need to but going out with Markus and Elin is like studying because they know so much stuff about the stuff I’m studying and give me good inspiration for my final paper.



I had some issues to sort out at home… the hot water in my bedroom wasn’t fixed all week… trying to find out some progress usually involved talking to three people trying to translate for each other… I figured in the end there was no point having the conversation unless Noor was present to effectively translate. We also had a very serious power cut… I was literally clicking submit for the essay plan I had to send to my tutor… when the power failed… again… and again… and again. The generator wasn’t kicking in and I decided to go to bed after hearing a lot of hammers banging… I was pleased with myself that I didn’t freak out though! And Usha went AWOL… no sign of her for 4 days. I eventually found out (with Noor’s help again) that she was unwell (she’s better now J).



Friday I had a nice evening but one that shows how typically frustrating Bangalore is. It was Chris’s last night in the city so I went to meet him and Pete for dinner… We all spent 1 ½ hours travelling to a restaurant called ‘Fisherman’s Wharf’… I arrived at mine… they arrived at theirs… and we found we were both in different restaurants (I was in the right one J). So they decided to come to me… and an hour and bit later they arrived. I’d already made my way through some nachos and a beer… I was so glad I waited for them as we had a really funny time! The restaurant wasn’t the best but there was a nightclub upstairs that shared restrooms with the restaurant and any visit to them was interesting… I found one poor girl passed out in the sink :/





Saturday 21st to Sunday 22nd May, Bangalore



Soooo the weekend was all fun. It started off well with breakfast and playing game online with Brian… then I set about studying. Writing my final essay EVER (assuming I pass, have to keep saying that to avoid tempting fate). It wasn’t fun at all… you’d think the last one ever would be a relief but I actually felt more desperate than I have with any of the others. I just wanted to be able to do nice things, like exercise and get my nails done but no, that all had to wait. I had some great support from friends back home (you know who you are), Jane and Sharon here and my neighbours. I went out on Saturday night to a local beer café with Marcus, Elin, Cameron and Bobby and they were all giving me inspiration. I did not leave the house on Sunday :/ I wished I was at home with my Mum and Dad feeding me and keeping me going J





Monday 23rd to Friday 27th May, Bangalore



This week was not the best and there’s not much to say about it. I got up, went to work, came home, and wrote. I mostly ate takeaways… which thankfully were not all unhealthy.



The big challenges were to do with my laptop. On Wednesday… whilst writing my essay on the way to work we went over a road bump… and I broke the hinge on my laptop (exactly the same thing that had happened to Brian’s a few months before). I didn’t know what to say… Noor didn’t know what to say… he could see I was so distressed. When I tried to open and close it it got worse and the screen started cracking… so it stayed open on the seat with Noor keeping a close eye on it as I went back to work. The kind people at work came and took a look at it, there was no hope. Anyway I got it home safely and it made it through to Tuesday (deadline day).



And then on Thursday I was sat at home writing when I realised the lights in the living room were off. I tried to turn them on and they wouldn’t work so I went off looking for the caretaker, who checked the trip switch and it wasn’t off. So they said an electrician would come out tomorrow. I then tried to email my essay to myself as a back up to find the internet wasn’t working… I figured it must be all part of the same connection. So I went back down to the caretaker and said this REALLY needs to be sorted ASAP. Tomorrow was the only option. I gave up for the night and half an hour later the doorbell rang and the caretaker and security guard were investigating the problem. They located a trip box in my apartment (I’d never noticed it and found something had tripped out). So yay I had lights and internet. I backed up my essay and settled down to watch my TV show… and then got low battery warnings even though my laptop was charging. Yep, charger was broken. !!!!!!!!!! I pretty much lost it at that point and went to bed.



I got it sorted over the next few days, with Noor’s help. Not sure what he made of me in tears in the backseat for a whole morning but he took it in his stride and was very protective as we were driving and walking all over the place looking for chargers. He later asked me if I’d called my husband (what he calls Brian), needed a doctor and suggested I got a cook to make sure I eat properly. And said that when I’ve finished my studies I had to have fun. Bless him.



Nice things this week were going to Seraphina, an Italian just down the road, with Marcus and Elin. As always they got me out when I needed it and gave me lots of inspiration. And on Friday going to Windmill Craftworks with Pete. It’s a microbrewery so we sampled some beer and listened to the band… who were billed as jazz but most definitely were not jazz. They were from Cornwall and very folky, they liked having a chat in between songs and whilst the music and singing was nice the chats and lyrics were random. Pete and I didn’t think it could get any worse at one point… then they started talking about finding frozen children and murder in the UK!





Saturday 24th to Monday 30th May



The weekend was all about Uni. I did join the gym on Saturday to give me something to look forward to. But other than that it was Uni. And Marcus and Elin getting me out for some food to an amazing Japanese, it was so good. We had the first rain of monsoon on Saturday night, turned the roads into rivers and the traffic into even more random chaos.



On Monday I worked from home and went to the doctor, who was brilliant, did such a good job and only charged £4.50. I went to the gym at lunchtime which I was so relieved about! And then after work I finished off my essay (my lovely colleague Sharon had proof read it and given some good feedback) and submitted it at about 9pm! Oh it was such a relief.



I decided to do an International Studies degree (politics, economic, development, the environment, history) with The Open University in 2009 so I have been doing it for just under 7 years (could have done it in 5 or 6 but had some breaks for various reasons). At the time it was a wonderful idea… and the first 3 years were enjoyable. I learned interesting things and never spent the recommended time on study but still got great marks. The last 3 years have been terrible… I remember ringing the university once to ask for an extension and them telling me… “you are doing a full time degree you know?!”. And I was like “Um no, I thought it was part time… because I have a full time job, you know”. Anyway it’s nearly sent me crazy at times, it really does take over and as much as I’d recommended The Open University (materials and support are great) you have to know what you’re getting into. It is tough, really tough around any job or other commitment but I have a demanding job, and my charity and house issues to sort out so the last push has been horrible. I am so grateful to my family, friends and colleagues for their support. I cannot name check everyone but my Mum and Dad have been incredible… letting me move home for the weekends so they could just feed me and give me company whilst I was writing… and Brian who also fed me, made me keep going when I wanted to stop and gave me alcohol if needed J And all my lovely friends who I could never do as much fun stuff with as I wanted to because I was already studying (you have me back now!... well when I'm back from India... you'll get random Skype's in the meantime) I’ll get my results in July and then I can put it behind me. I’m already feeling happier and like I can do fun stuff again!



Also on Monday… I packed as going away for the week with work. So next… on tour in the west…



Lots of love. A very much happier…. with a weight lifted…

Hey all!

I use this blog to remember things and keep my family and friends up to date on what I’m doing… but anyone is welcome J

Monday 2nd to Friday 6th May 2016

This week was another typical work week so no exciting pictures… more random ones I’m afraid. Jane my colleague stayed Monday and Tuesday and it was really nice to have a visitor and see a friendly face. I felt terrible I had to send her off to work without breakfast on Monday… (as we’d got back from Pondicherry so late the night before the shops were shut, Brian sorted the situation during the day so she had something for Tuesday). Brian was still recovering from being sick so we didn’t eat out, Jane taught me how to make pasta bake in the combi-oven, it was a revelation!

This week was a Uni essay writing week so I went into my standard crazy mode. It’s the penultimate one (after 7 years) and I’ve had enough now. A couple of times during the week I thought about just stopping but thanks to Brian’s encouragement I got there. It just took some late nights and a little bit of wine which always helps the writing process. I also had some stuff to do for Believe In Better (the charity I'm a trustee of www.bibetter.co.uk) so had to be good at multi-tasking.

There were some interesting trips to buy wine this week. One day on the way home I asked Noor if we could stop somewhere other than the Spar (because it takes so long) so he found a liquor store and parked outside. I went to get out to go and buy it and he said “NO mam, I will go”. I was like “what’s up Noor… I can go?” and he wouldn’t let me because he said it’s not a nice place to go because the men in the shops drink. So in he went with some instructions to buy any bottle of Sula (Indian wine) and he came out with a good one. Jane told me later her driver is also protective of her going into liquor stores because it’s not typical for women to go in them.

Another time I got home and Brian and I went together to buy wine. That whole hour or so trip was one of the most ridiculous and funny hours I’ve spent, it was like something out of Fawlty Towers. I don’t think I can explain it in a way that can do it justice (it’s one of those things where you had to be there) but I would like to remember this in years to come so I’ll try…

Noor had finished for the day so we ordered an Uber. Everything started off well, we saw it on the little map driving towards us and within a few minutes it was outside. So we left the apartment and in the parking lot Brian asked someone he didn’t recognise “Uber driver?” and the guy said “Yes”. Now I thought that was a bit strange as I’d seen the guy earlier but went with it … until it became clear to Brian that this guy definitely wasn’t the Uber driver (turns out he’s the new caretaker).

So we went out onto the street and saw the Uber car… parked in a dark spot which meant I didn’t see the dogs mess all over the road and stood in it. In flip flops. I was not impressed and got in the car pretty unhappy, trying hard not to get it on anything. Brian and I nearly had a domestic as he could see I was a bit pi**ed and I wouldn’t tell him why (I didn’t want to alert the driver to the situation) but when I managed to get the message across he said “Me too”. He was just dealing with it better than me!

We didn’t know the address of the liquor store but Brian knew where it was so directed the driver. We started off well, heading in the right direction then at one particular junction it all went wrong with the conversation going something like this:

Brian: “That’s it, straight, keep going straight”

Mr Uber: “Left?” Brian: “No, straight”

Mr Uber: “Left sir?” Brian: “No. Keep going straight”

Mr Uber: “Not left?” Brian: “No. Go straight”.

Mr Uber starts turning left.

Brian: “No, don’t turn left”. We keep turning left.

Mr Uber: “Left yes?” Brian: “No, you are doing the opposite of what I want you to do”.

Mr Uber: “Straight?” Brian: “YES, straight”.

We continue turning left.

Brian (sarcastically): “Perfect”. Mr Uber (excited and pleased with himself): “Perfect Sir?” (at this point I couldn’t hold the laughter in anymore).

So then Brian had to try and recover the situation which wasn’t easy because of all the one way streets. The driver kept on not following instructions and we ended up down several dead ends. I think he realised it was a bit amusing because one time when I couldn’t help laughing he laughed with me. Brian saw somewhere he recognised so we got out. And as we got out Mr Uber said “You give me 5 stars man?” and Brian was like “Yeah I’ll give you 5 stars bro…for comedic value”.

We made it to the liquor store and it was really good, lots of choice. On the way back we took an Auto and this driver definitely knew where he was going and what he was doing. I did fear for our lives at one point though! We approached the main road (which we needed to be on the other side of) and there were 4 rows of moving traffic coming from the right… my first though was oh great we have to get in that and then find somewhere to do a U-Turn (which takes ages) but oh no… fear not… the Auto man was not going to waste time and without any hesitation just headed straight out into the traffic! I couldn’t speak… Brian just said ‘Oh my god’ and somehow… despite feeling like fishes swimming upstream… we made it!

Brian seemed to have a good week. He found a good dentist (one of the best dentists in the city is a short walk away from my apartment…) and it’s amazing how cheap everything was. He also found some nice places for breakfast and lunch. And had some interesting encounters with Usha. Brian does not enjoy having a maid (I feel quite uncomfortable with it too but I can see how helpful it is during the working week). Usha is very efficient but speaks limited English (so it’s hard to explain what needs doing) and doesn’t have a regular start time so she’s either waking him up or delaying any trips out. She’s also quite fond of washing up things as he’s cooking… and still using them. But one day he decided to go out once she’d arrived and leave her with instructions for shutting the door. It took a few attempts and on the first try… whilst he was demonstrating how she should leave and shut the door… she got the wrong end of the stick and thought he wanted to leave so after saying a hasty “Sorry Sir” (bless her, she must have thought she’d done something wrong) put her shoes on and left the apartment. He had to go running after her… he finally thought he’d got the message across… only to come home and find the door wide open! I’ve had some trouble too with helping her understand that the key I’ve been leaving with at security is for her to keep… and that she needs to lock the back door. So I’ve now enlisted my lovely landlords help to explain.

Other eventful events of the week were a huge cockroach arriving in the apartment which thankfully Brian dealt with (he was willing to pick it up to put it outside!) and me causing a scene at work when I tried to heat up my lunch in the microwave. It exploded (and before anyone – aka Dad!) – says anything I was using a microwaveable container, in the right way) and exploding butter chicken is not pretty. I was so embarrassed, everyone crowded around… I tried to clean it up… nobody would let me clean it up and then the cleaning lady who happened to be nearby gave me the most unimpressed looks… I saw her the next day and smiled and I got another very unimpressed look :/ We also went out to a really nice Indian restaurant called Tandoor with the neighbour Marcus (who we’d met before) and his wife Elin (who’d just come back from overseas). That was really nice and the food was amazing… although I got a shock when I realised that the huge amount of food we’d just eaten was only the starter. My landlord also bonded with Brian during one daytime visit and asked us round for tea, that was really nice and I feel lucky to have such a good landlord.

Saturday 7th and Sunday 8th May 2016

The weekend was pretty lazy. Saturday we had breakfast at one of Brian’s finds… the 154 Breakfast Club. It was soooo good, they even had baked beans but they were too sweet to be Heinz. We then went to Forum Mall Which is not far from my apartment. That was really good, so big with nice shops (including Accessorize and The Body Shop) and lots to do. I could waste a lot of time there J We were going to go out for dinner at Binjara Junction (which the landlord had recommended) but it got a bit late once I’d got to a good point in my essay so we attempted to try takeaway… the restaurant told Brian to use an App called Swiggy… which we did and it was great. So many different takeaway options! We ordered from Binjara Junction (they wouldn’t accept an international card so had to pull all our cash to pay to do it and make it with a few rupees to spare) and I was so excited that you could watch the progress of your order… and the journey of the guy from Swiggy going to collect it. It was seriously good food, Brian said it was the best Indian meal he’s ever had and one of the best meals he’s ever had.

Sunday was all about essay writing (grrr) and packing. Brian cooked a lovely breakfast and the landlord arranged for Biryani to be delivered which was amazing. In the evening we went to the PVR cinema in the Forum Mall to watch Captain America in Gold Class. It was £10 a ticket and something a bit special, entering into a lounge which had pretty much a full on restaurant menu and seats that were fully reclining… our popcorn and drinks were delivered to our seats. The only trouble was that those seats made you felt sleepy. We got an Auto back which is always fun…

At the apartment we chilled and finished packing up… we were leaving in the early hours for the airport. I was going ‘on tour’ with work to the north and Brian was leaving India, his tourist visa expired on Tuesday and he had to go back to work L Neither of us were very happy about it but we’re used to saying bye now and at least this time we had a plan and knew when we’d see each other again. I will visit him this time (flights are booked!) which is the least I can do after he came to India… something that I’m incredibly grateful and thankful to him for because it’s made the move so much easier… and more fun.

Next up Gurgaon, Chandigarh and Jaipur.

Lots of love.

Perfect sunset at Mandovi River, Goa
8TH APRIL, 2016 – FRIDAY



On Ugadi day, we commenced our one week trip to Mumbai, various places of Maharashtra and Goa from Bangalore. Myself and my wife became frequent traveller to nearby and distant places from Bangalore. I love to drive our Hyundai Xcent car thru highways. Usually, she navigates the way as also keep a watch on the road. So far our combination worked reasonably well. This time my 90 year old father was also accompanying us upto Mumbai. Our son would be a late entrant to our trip but his joining was un-certain.

Tour program

Our plan was to reach Borivali, Mumbai at my relative’s place on the same day, take rest next day and resume our journey (myself and my wife) from third day onwards.

Our holiday plan was as follows :

1. 8th April 2016 - Journey Bangalore to Mumbai,

2. 9th April, 2016 - Stay at Mumbai

3. 10th & 11th April, 2016 - MTDC Resort, Mahabaleswar,

4. 12th & 13th April, 2016 - Hotel Calangute Residency Annex, Calangute, Goa,

5. 14th & 15th 2016 - Dudhsagar Spa & Resorts, Dudhsagar, Mollem, Goa
Pratapgarh Fort of Shivaji


6. 16th April, 2016 - Back to Bangalore

Hotel bookings were made in Advance.


Ugadi (Karnataka) & Gudi Pawda (Maharashtra) Festivals

Our trip began on Ugadi day, the auspicious day for beginning of Karnataka new year. Like Ugadi in Karnataka, this day was celebrated for “Gudi Parwa Festival (beginning of new year)” in Maharashtra. People celebrated this day by cleaning their homes, wearing new dresses and visiting temples to have blessings of God.



Bangalore to Mumbai – 1035 Km



Route (Thru NH 4)-

Yasvantpur-Pennya-Tumkur-Harihar-Chitradurg-Dharwar-Belgaum-Kolhapur-Pune-Panvel-Borivali

We started at around 6 AM in the morning. Upto Neelamangala, roads were having comparatively less traffic possibly due to Ugadi Festival.

A distinct advantage of Bangalore compared to other major Indian cities was that if there was increase in the mercury level, there would be a downpour mostly in the evening. But this season rain god did not spare Bangalore and the temperature was unusally high.

NH 4 was a six lane Highway, brilliant road and a pleasure to drive. At the same time it was painfully expensive due to innumerable no. of “Toll Gates” through out the entire route.
Raigad Fort of Shivaji


At around 10.30 AM we had a break for refreshment at Kamat Hotel, Rannebennur. It was scorching summer time. Several areas which we would travel in the next few days received less rain-fall thereby having severe water-crisis.

The next break was near High court at Dharwar to negotiate with the outside hot weather. There was caution notice of “Silence Please” being High Court area. Hence we started after brief stop.

Upto Belgaum (Belagavi) the drive was exceedingly smooth due to less traffic. Only around Hubli a brief portion was two lane highway needing careful drive. I thought of continuing our journey as far as possible to take advantage of afternoon less traffic.

As the journey progressed, I noticed the change in landscape, people and their dress, the houses. Nearby fields were dry with traces of greenery in few places. On the way to Kolhapur, occasionally there were sudden appearance of tractors/vehicles from the opposite side in the same lane. I found it risky and required caution.

After Kolhapur we had to slow down due to frequent road diversion consequent to road broadening work. This continued in Satara and almost upto outskirts of Pune. Journey around
Sunset at Calangute Beach Goa
Satara was very pleasant due to its panoramic beauty amongst hills. Afternoon sunlight touching the surroundings created a mystic environment. It was a pleasing drive.

At around 4.30 PM we stopped for a break at Kamat Idli Hotel between Kolhapur and Satara. Subsequently we came across “Vittal Kamat Hotel” in several places of our trip.

When we reached Pune City it was around 6.30 PM. Roads were filled with considerable traffic (noticeably large no of two wheelers). Somehow we could reach the toll gate of Pune Express Highway and started our voyage towards Mumbai. This expressway was well-known for its brilliant roads but again very expensive indeed. There were lot of steep curves and U-turns in the expressway which needed careful drive particularly at night.

The expressway ended near Panvel and we entered Panvel, Mumbai at around 8.30 PM.

At around 10.30 PM we reached Borivali at my relative’s place. There was comparatively less crowd in Mumbai roads also due to Gudi Padwa festival.

We were worried about father’s health condition, but he remained steady although occasionally un-comfortable throughout the route.

10TH APRIL, 2016 – SUNDAY


JOURNEY TOWARDS MAHABALESWAR (300 KMS):

Our destination was Mahabaleswar, a popular hill station (around 4500 Ft.) not very far from Mumbai. The distance was around 300 Kms (depending on the route we select).

We started at 5.30 AM in the early morning from Borivali to avoid the peak Mumbai traffic.

There were two usual routes for going to Mahabaleswar from Mumbai. The first alternative was to take Mumbai-Pune Expressway, to reach Pune-Satara-Wahi-Panchgani-Mahabaleswar. The other route was thru Panvel-Kochi Highway (NH 66) Karanjkhol-Mahad- Poladpur.

First route was convenient but the second route offered scenic beauty, more ghat distance to cover, two lane highway and above all crowded and risky.

Initially we thought of following the first route. However after crossing Panvel and touching the Expressway we changed our plan and selected the second one.

Both of us felt the urge of a morning tea break. The road side hotel where we had stopped just opened his shop. He took his time and in the end we were served freshly made idlis and hot tea.

We were driving thru Khapoli-Pali Road to get Mumbai-Goa road (NH 66). Initially the
Motral remains of St. Francis Xavier
road was narrow and went thru the forest. On the way, we came across two rivers, Amba River on the left and Savitri River on the right.

Amba River

This river was following the Khapoli Road on the left side. It had less water possibly due to immense heat. But there were dense forests and hills on the other side of the river.

Gradually the road became wider and we crossed the river after reaching NH 66. A double decker train accompanying us on the left side. After a few kilometres suddenly a big river appeared on the right side. That was Savitri river.

Beautiful turn of Savitri River

It was very wide and in full flow. After proceeding further the Savitri river took a beautiful turn. There was a restaurant on the river side called Neelkamal. The place was exotic that we fell in love with the place. We spent nearly an hour in that place. A Hot Spring and a temple were located on the opposite bank of the river. A small Dinghi was carrying passengers on the other side. We thought of going there but later on cancelled the idea due
Bom Jesus Basilica,Goa
to paucity of time.

A breakfast with omelette, pao and tea. Pao (bread lightly fried) is one of the most popular snacks items in this area and used in wide varities of food.

There was a banian tree on the bank of the river. We sat there, enjoyed the gentle breeze, calm and quietness of the place and splendid nature around. This place was so charming so that I wish I could visit it one day again.

Poladpur

This was an important junction since the hilly road towards Mahabaleswar began here. There was a circle with Sivaji maharaj’s statute. There we had to take left turn. Mahabaleswar was around 40 Kms from here.

Initial around ten kilometres road condition was bad. A small river was following the river and construction of culverts were going on four places of the road crossing thatng stream.

Ghat section began thereafter That road had large no. of U-turns, sudden bent and surprise arrival of vehicles from the opposite side. The road was narrow at some places like normal hilly roads but occasionally having heavy traffic with all kinds of small and large vehicles. In certain places it was
Multi Tiers of Dudhsagar Falls
steep with deviations.

Otherwise, this curvy and scenic ghat road was spectacular through tall mountain ranges, deep valleys and dangerous ridges, although dry due to scorching summer. Usually vehicles at the descent were very helpful. When our upcoming car was noticed, they usually stopped until we completely cross the turning. Overall it required due caution as well as patient driving .


Straw-berries and Mulberries

There are small refreshing places on the road. Small shop-keepers showcased various fruits like straw-berries, Mulberries, jack-fruits, guavas at various places on the way. Straw berries, Mulberries are famous in Mahabaleswar. I am not addicted to fruits other than sweet taste, but my wife insisted to stop and I bought a few for test. Straw-berry was attractive but a bit sour in taste. Comparatively I preferred Mulberries which looked black like a big ant and tasted better. Jackfruits were very big in size. We wanted a portion of it. Despite our insistence we could not convince any seller to part with a few seeds.

At around 1 PM we reached MTDC Cottage at Mahabaleswar.

MTDC Resort,
Para Gliding Kolva Beach Goa
Mahabaleswar

MTDC Tourist Resort was located in a vast area, slightly distant from the main town. Individual cottages were spread one by one in two parallel rows, garden with trees, children’s play area in between. Reception & Restaurant were located slightly far away.

The cottage room was quite big, but room walls were shabby and with damp in certain places. On the other side there was a wide courtyard. This place was surrounded by big trees, but railings of the courtyard looked rusted. Lack of maintenance was evident. These rooms required renovation.

Otherwise the place was decent to stay and enjoy amidst nature. We saw varieties of birds, two giant squirrels and a monkey brigade sitting just outside the room.

There was a small room in between the bedroom and the toilet. A water-filter was provided. The water was pleasantly cool and refreshing. In my entire stay I enjoyed the normal drinking water provided by MTDC resort. It was nice to drink.

Our cottage charge was Rs. 2600. While reporting at the reception Rs 200 had to be deposited as a refundable deposit.e various fruits like straw-berries, jack-fruits, guavas at various places. Straw berries, R

Compared to the unbearable summer we experienced throughout our journey from Bangalore to Mumbai, this place was cool and comfortable.

Market area and Veena lake

Our first destination was the market area. Keeping the car within the Car Parking area we started walking towards the Veena lake after having brief snacks. It took around half an hour to reach there. The lake was good for viewing. It has boating facilities, but there was not much time since we had to reach to our next destination i.e. the sunset point in time. We walked and spent time in the lake garden.

Sun-set point

When we reached the Sunset point it was around 5.30 PM . The place was near to the MTDC Resort. There were horse-riding facilities to stroll nearby areas. Gradually the place became crowded with tourists. Sun-set timing was around 06.45 PM. Sun-set was ok, nice to observe.

Immediately after reaching Mahabaleswar, my AIRTEL 4G connection was lost. Subsequently the connectivity became erratic and disturbing. This problem I faced during my entire stay in this place.

Dinner items

There were lot of choices in the MTDC Restaurant menucard. We selected “Methi
Mulberry Mahabaleswar
Bhajji (a preparation with methi vegetables mixed with spices)” and “Batata Mutter Rassa ( a soup mixed with vegetables)” along with other items. Methi Bhajji was delicious.


11TH APRIL, 2016 – STAY AT MAHABALESWAR



A cool early morning

A cool and comfortable early morning. I woke up to see the nature. Munia preferred to sleep some more time. I was lazily standing near the car in front of my cottage. Suddenly two dogs came out from the bottom of the car. They expressed their un-happiness with my presence. Initially I was worried how to control the situation. I collected some biscuits from my stock and distributed between them. Slowly the entire family emerged with babies. My biscuit and snack stocks were getting depleted. But they cooled down and started playing between each other. I watched their happiness for nearly an hour till Munia woke up and called for morning tea. It was a very unique experience.


Forts near Mahabalewar

Mahabaleswar had many tourist places to offer like temples, viewpoints. Guide/Tourist Cabs are available in plenty and immediately after
Beautiful chandelier at Bom Jesus Basilica
approaching Mahabaleswar circle, there were enquiries for Tourist Guides/Cabs.

But I was fascinated with Glory of Shivalji Maharaj, the Maratha King from my young age and longed to see the places he ruled. There were two famous forts built by Shivaji and his people which were located near Mahabaleswar. They were Prataphgarh and Raigarh Forts respectively. Both the places were en-route to my journey which I covered yesterday on my journey from Mumbai.

I had only two days booking in this place. It was clear that if I opted for local sightseeing I could not cover those forts since both of them were located far away. Another issue was not operating of Google Maps (due to not having AIRTEL connectivity).

After initial hesitation, we selected for the forts.

Pratapgarh Fort



This fort was around 20 Kms from Mahabaleswar. On the way to Poladpur (which we travelled yesterday) thru Mahabaleswar-Poladpur Highway, there was a left turn after around 18 Kms and then a narrow road reached the fort gate.

The fort was located at height of around 3500 Ft. The entire fort was surrounded by Sahyadri range mountains. The invincibility of the fort
Sunset at Mandovi River different moods
could be felt only on personal visit to that place. The visitor had to climb around 300 steps to reach inside the main fort area.

While buying the entry ticket, we paid for a Guide (Total Rs 300/-) also. Without a proper description the fort visit would be felt like a dry old building.

The guide (Prem) was a simple young chap. His residence was inside the fort with his family. He earned his livelihood as a Guide throughout the year except three months of rainy season when the area remain inaccessible for visitor. He narrated the history of the fort quite lively.


Legend of encounter between Shivaji and Afzal Khan

The fort was constructed in 1656. It was the first major fort erected by Shivaji Maharaj. There were several battles in this fort, but most famous was the “Battle of Pratapgarh” between Shivaji and Afzal Khan (the commander of Adil Sahi Kingdom of Bijapur).

As per history when Shivaji and Afzal Khan privately met at a place near the fort, both were prepared for others treachery. In the name
Big foot luotolim Museum, Goa
of embracing Shivaji, Afzal Khan applied his dagger towards his opponent but did not succeed. Shivaji immediately attacked Afzal with his hidden “Bagh Nakh” (Tiger’s nail).

Later on Afzal Khan was killed by Shivaji which ultimately paved the way for his winning the war against the Adil Shah dynasty of Bijapur. In brief this major victory culminated to the destruction of the dynasty of Bijapur and rise of Maratha Empire.

We travelled to the interiors of the fort, the watertank, soldiers abode etc. The huge main door still looked invincible. Later on we went to the Ma Bhawani Temple and Shiva Temple respectively inside the fort. Guide showed a place from where the traitors were thrown from the fort to death.

This centuries old fort was still owned and maintained by ancestors of the Maratha rulers. There was a big statute of Shivaji on horse-back which was inaugurated by the first prime minister of India, Pdt Nehru.

The whole visit ended in one an half hour. When we came back to our car, it was around 12 Pm in the afternoon. We decided to go to our next journey, the Raigad Fort.

Raigad Fort
Fish Aquarium Goa



This was the largest fort of Shivaji. Located at the height of around 2500 Ft, this place was the capital of Shivaji. Shivaji ruled his kingdom from this place for six years from 1674.

For visiting Raigad Fort we had to travel through the route which we covered yesterday. Starting from Pratapgarh, first we had to come to Poladpur thru Mahabaleswar highway, then to take right turn to touch NH 66. After driving around 20 odd kilometres, we took right turn in Mahad and drove another 22 Kms to reach our destination. Total distance travelled from Pratapgarh to Raigad was around 70 Kms.

When we reached Raigad, the area looked to be deserted due to scorching mid-day heat. We heard that there was a Ropeway to reach to the top of the mountain. But the circumstances made us sceptical whether it would be operational. In that case our entire effort would be wasted.

To our relief we found the ropeway operational. Car Parking fee was Rs 50/-. Ropeway charge was Rs 250 per head.

It took hardly ten minutes to reach to the top. The ropeway journey was delightful with a panoramic view of
Shantadurga Temple, Goa
the vast area of mountain ranges.

Here also we hired a guide (Charges Rs 200, although officially he did not ask any specific amount). This fort was maintained by Archaeological Survey of India.

A fort worth visit:

The fort area was huge and from the downhill it was difficult to believe that such a vast land existed on the mountain top. The Shayadri mountain ranges surrounded in all its sides which made this place safe and difficult to conquer.

The guide explained that ropeway thru which we reached to the fort was actually at its back side. The main door was at the other side and one had to climb around 1700 steps to reach to the top. He took us to the main area where a multi-storey wooden house was there.

There were ruins of rooms for Shivaji’s queens, his ministers and other trusted associates. Then there were Deewan-e-Khas (for visiting ministers and dignitaries) and Deewan-e-aam (visiting commoners by the king).

Next there was a vast king’s courtyard and place where Kings throne was situated. Presently a statute of Shivaji was erected at the place of his throne. Right in front of the
Restaurant glittering at night, Calangute Beach, Goa
courtyard was the huge entrance thru which the coronation of Shivaji as king was made. Then there was big marketplace where the transaction could be done on horseback.

Death of the great king also came here. His Samadhi was made slightly far away in front of a temple.

The fort was destroyed by the British during first half of nineteenth century. Each and every portion we saw had interesting story. We were en-thrilled and mesmerised. We thanked the guide for his nice description of history.

The only disadvantage of our voyage was the un-bearable temperature on top of the fort thru mid-day sun, which was further escalated due to heat generated from the hot stone at the fort site.

When we finished our fort-visit, it was around 3.30 PM. We felt exhausted and my wife was feeling un-easy. After a brief rest at the down-hill we began our journey back to MTDC Mahabaleswar at around 4.30 PM.

But the journey was not comfortable since she became un-well due to mild sun-stoke. Somehow we came back to our destination. But in the evening her un-easiness increased with nausea, headache, vomiting and other un-easiness. It stretched further
Sunset at mandovi River, Goa
at night and at one point of time I was thinking to suspend our tour.


12TH APRIL, 2016 - MAHABALESWAR TO CALANGUTE, GOA (370 KMS)


Munia could recover from yesterday’s distress. With a sigh of relief I resumed our plan to pack up for our next destination, Calangute, Goa. I decided to start late morning to give her some time to feel better and to prepare ourselves. It would be a long drive thru Ghat road. To tackle the heat we accumulated sufficient liquid of Glucose, Butter-Milk and Electrol apart from normal water in the car.

Route

There were two alternative routes to reach Calangute as follows :

i. Via NH 4 – Mahabaleswar-Meda-Satara-Kolhapur-Niphani-Ambali-Calangute

ii. Via NH 66 (Mumbai-Goa Road) – Mahabaleswar-Poladpur-Ratnagiri-Goa

NH 4 was a six lane highway and ideal for drive. Moreover, it was a known route. Also it would be a different route upto Satara which we did not travel before. Hence we opted for the same.

Journey to Calangute, Goa



We started at around 9.30 AM. The road from Mahabaleswar to Satara via Meda (around 60 Km) was a two lane highway. Initially after
Beautiful tea cups in a road-side restaurant, on the way to Mahabaleswar
Mahabaleswar it was narrow and jig jag at Ghat section. Road quality was ok and there was not much problem to drive. There were notices in Marathi (apaghat or accident-prone area) particularly in turnings, which reminds the driver for careful drive.

In Satara there was a small difficulty in finding out the link to NH 4. Our Google Map directed to a small lane which was blocked. Ultimately we touched NH 4 at around 12 PM.

While driving at NH 4, I was looking to check my car tyres and to fill up Nitrogen in a Petrol Pump. Unfortunately, Nitrogen filling stations were very few and one such station although detected but I missed out.

Both myself and the car were feeling hungry. I gave a break after crossing Kolhapur to fill petrol and ate some fruits and liquid from our stocks.

After Niphani ( around 2 Hours journey in NH 4) and before Sankeswar, we took a right turn to catch the state highway. This road was narrow and it took time to negotiate after a smooth drive in NH 4.

At Ajara we stopped briefly to have a tea break. It was around
Beautiful Savitri River on the way to Mahabaleswar
3 ‘O Clock and our destination was still around 90 Km away.

Drive thru Amboli Ghat Section

Next journey was thru Amboli Ghat section. Suddenly the landscape changed and we were driving thru majestic mountains and the deep valleys. Afternoon sunlight created an amazing contrast on the horizon. There were caution boards at the road side against dangerous driving and landslides.

It was a beautiful drive and probably the best part of our entire tour. The scenic beauty was breathtaking with mountains with lush greeneries all over, although it needed careful Ghat drive. This portion took around an hour to cross.




Sunset at Calangute Beach



When we reached Calangute, Goa it was around 6.15 in the evening. We had the advantage of late sunset due to longer summer days. We checked in Hotel Calangute Residency Annex (a Goa Tourism budget Hotel very near the sea beach) quickly and rushed to the sea beach.

It was a perfect sun-set. The beach was full with thousands of tourists, a sizable portion being foreigners. Even after the night fall the beach was crowded. I was damn tired. I lied down on the
Evening sun between Mulberies, Mahabaleswar
beach and had a nice sleep in cool breeze. I heard somebody telling his buddy on the way “pii ke sou gia (look, a drunkard is sleeping)’. Doesn’t matter as soon as you get the comfort you deserve.

Splendid dinner at Souza Lobo

There were no. of restaurants held at the Calangute Beach, offering Drinks, Dinner, snacks and other food items. Ignoring others request we selected Hotel Souza Lobo for having a Candle Light Dinner in the open air since we were interested for Fish Food.

The hotel was situated very near to the beach entrance. There were various fish food items mentioned in the menu card. But Pomphret preparations were beyond our budget. We selected “Grilled Macarel” which were least costly along with other items. The food was extremely delicious. There was a live singing arrangement also.




Cute cat watching our dinner

While eating, we suddenly saw a mild sound “miao” and two naughty healthy cats came out slowly from inside a food table. We were frightened, but the waiter boy assured that they would do nothing. He also advised not to give any food to them. To our delight, both
Statute of Shivaji in Pratapgarh Fort
the cats moved away after some time.

To summarise, we had a memorable dinner at this hotel. Whoever comes to Calangute, this restaurant would be a “must-eat”.

Calangute Market

Apart from all kinds of food stalls, restaurants, the noticeable thing was so many shops for tattoos. There were shops for hiring two-wheelers. Also lot of shops were selling light beach garments. A sizable portion of tourists were young couples, groups of boys and girls as also families with children. Even desi tourists (men and women) were travelling wearing shorts and very light dress. We saw hoardings in Russian Language in many shops.

Hotel Calangute Residency Annex

The main hotel called ‘Hotel Calangute Residency (a hotel of Goa Tourism)” was located in the most lucrative position in Calangute (almost on the sea shore). Our selected abode (Hotel Calangute Residency Annex, also a budget hotel of Goa Tourism) was situated slightly far away, but very conveniently placed and most significantly in front of the bus stand. Hotel tariff (Rs 1500 with complimentary break-fast) was also quite reasonable (courtesy Makemytrip.com) compared to other standard hotels in the locality.

Noticeably there were very few boarders in the hotel,
Donkeys carrying loads in Pratapgarh Fort
god knows why. We found the rooms are reasonably good and clean. A small disadvantage that there was no lift. That was not at all an issue for us.



13TH APRIL, 2016 – STAY AT CALANGUTE, GOA


Package Tour - South Goa

Goa tourism arrange “package tours” at various places of Goa, most popular among them were “South Goa” and “North Goa” tours. We had to select South Goa since we were told that AC buses were available only for “South Goa” (package cost Rs 300/-) trip.

The bus arrived nearly one hour late (9.45 AM). Condition of the bus was also not ok. Some of the seats were broken and not usable. Goa being one of the most popular destination, Goa Tourism should look into those minor glitches.

We travelled to various tourist destinations through-out the day. Separate entry fees were payable for visiting Aquarium (Rs 150) and Big Foot Loutolim (Rs 250) respectively. We found both these places quite ordinary.

Kolva Beach

Stoppage to Kolva Beach was worth remembering. Guide explained that it was the 2nd longest (19 km) sea beach in India (after Marina, Chennai). There were varieties
Pratapgarh Fort Near Mahabaleswar, Maharastra
of water-sports arrangements like Para-sailing, Jet-skiing, Surfing, Speed-boat ride . All the sports seemed to be interesting, only if you have deep pocket.

Better to have it than to repent later

We started negotiating for Para-sailing but became hesitant due to price quoted. Suddenly we saw, one of our fellow tourist, an old and thin person man came, paid the money, took a sip of drink from his liquor bottle and became ready for the trip. So far we were ignoring him because of his weak look. Within minutes he flew into the air with the running speed-boat and a dazzling parachute on the sky. It was an amazing sight.

There was no time for us to join and we left the beach with an interesting experience.

Spectacular Indo-Portugese architecture in Shantadurga & Mungeshi Temples

There were two beautiful temples in our tour. Both these temples are the most revered in Goa. First-one was the Shantadurga Temple. After lunch we visited Shri Mangeshi temple which was connected to the legendary singer Lata Mangeshkar and her family who originally belonged to that place.

The architecture of both these temples were totally different from temples that
Siva Temple inside Pratapgarh Fort, Mahabaleswar
we normally saw in other parts of India. It was built in western style with arched windows, multi-coloured glass-panes, a big chandelier and a wide hall in the temple premises. Adjacent to each temple a multi-storied lamp tower was built.

Another noticeable feature was the cleanliness maintained inside the temple premises. An overall serene atmosphere prevailed in both the temples. We saw a water tank also in the Mungeshi temple. A beautiful Classical Bhajan was being played during our visit to the Mungeshi temple, may be the legendary voice of Paluskar or his gharana, I am not sure. Overall it was a brief but nice experience worth remembering. These two temples are must visit in Goa, according to me.

Basilica of Bom Jesus

The last point was theBasilica of Bom Jesus which holds the mortal remains of St. Francis Xavier. It was a UNESCO World Heritage Site and one of the most popular tourist places in Goa.

The church is more than 400 yers old and one of the oldest church in India. St Francis died on the way to China. His mortal remains was brought back and kept in this Church. His remains is kept
A road-side hotel on the bank of Savitri River, Mohad
for public viewing once every ten years and attract viewers all over the world.

But time allotted by the guide was only twenty minutes, too short to visit such a large and important place.

Sun-set Cruise by Goa Tourism

Last but not the least was the one hour river cruise sailing thru the Mandovi River. Tickets (Rs 300/- per head) were purchased from our Package tour guide. Tour bus dropped us near the jetty.

When we reached, there were already hundreds of tourists waiting in the que to board the ship. But when the entry gate opened the entire crowd was managed in a very well-planned and disciplined manner.

The ship was quite big and three storied. Luckily we could occupy seats on the top floor. Sailing started at around 6’o clock. Entertainment program started immediately after that. The whole show was skilfully managed by a DJ and his associates. Initially there was a music and dance performance by local professionals. In due course he called and involved the audience to participate. There were separate dance program among tourist couple, only ladies, only men, only children one after another. Many of them joined and
Ruins of queens place, Raigad Fort, Maharastra
enjoyed the show to its maximum.

At around 6.45 PM we watched a breath-taking sun-set kissing horizons around the Mandovi River. Every one was so engulfed with joy as if there was no grief and sorrow any-where. Entire one hour period was so thrilling that we came to the reality only when the ship touched the jetty.

We returned to our hotel by Public bus. It was about an hour journey. We were very tired. Had dinner in the hotel itself.


14TH APRIL, 2016 – CALANGUTE TO DUDHSAGAR, MOLLEM (70 KMS)



We had booking in Dudhsagar Spa & Resorts, Mollem for the next two days. The distance to be covered was not much. It was planned to start late.

Morning I had a nice bath at the sea beach. While commencing our journey the pending work of getting the tyre pressure checked and filling nitrogen again occupied my thought. After continuous enquiry for more than an hour we could trace a tyre shop in Panaji to fill Nitrogen.

Tyre puncture

Unfortunately, the tyre pressure of one of the tyre was found to be quite low. I became very much worried since
Mulberies Mahabaleswar
we had to take a long journey after few days. The shop-keeper advised me to go to one “Geeta Bekary” for tyre repair. This was so well known, everybody knew but after lot of twist and turn we could find it.

I was amazed when the shopkeeper detected a nail inside the tyre. The problem of tube-less tyre was that it was not easily visible with a look at the tyre. Any way it was a huge sigh of relief and unless detected the puncture could spoil my journey in mid way.

Dudhsagar Spa & Resorts, Mollem

Around 3.30 PM we reached the spa. The journey was thru NH 4A. This spa was placed immediately after a checkpost at Mollem and just before the “Bhagawan Mahabir Wildlife Sanctuary”. A very calm and quite place compared to the crowd of Goa Beaches.

The room-tariff was extremely low (Rs 600 per day including complementary Break-fast, courtesy Makemytrip.com), but the amenities at the resorts were excellent.

Argument with Resort officials

I booked for two persons i.e myself and my wife. My son joined today with us. When I requested for the extra bed at our alloted room,
Raigad Fort, Maharastra
the hotel officials demanded Rs 1500 extra to accommodate him. Their argument was that the concessional tariff availed by us would not be applicable for the additional person and I would have to pay the original room tariff.

It was big blow for me. Initially I thought of going back tomorrow morning itself. However after arguing continuous they agreed to accept the proportionate tariff of Rs 300 for providing an extra bed.

The resort was located covering a vast land area. There were two types of rooms, one was Cottage where we stayed and another choice was tent. All of these rooms were spread throughout the resort area . It has got all modern facilities like Spa, Swimming Pool, Activity area, splendid garden etc.

Although initial response was slightly painful, we were delighted to see the Cottage allotted. It was equipped with all modern facilities like AC, nice wardrobe, cosy beds, small but clean toilets etc. Overall it was a nice place to enjoy our stay at a very reasonable cost.

Lunch time was over. We decided to visit Kollem railway station, which was around six kms from there. Our purpose was to visit the well-known
Magnificient sunset at Calangute Beach, Goa
Dudhsagar Waterfalls by train. But after reaching station at around 5 PM we came to know that sometimes back a train already passed thru the station. There was no further train today.

Pleasant memory of our earlier Dudhsagar trek thru railway tracks during full monsoon

Kollem was a small railway station. There were few shops outside the station. We had a pleasant memory of visiting Dudhsagar Falls two years back during full monsoon and coming back to this station

It was a eleven kilometre trek thru railway tracks from Castle Rock railway station upto the Dudhsagar falls. There was incessant rain throughout the day. After crossing no. of tunnels thru rail tracks when we ultimately reached our destination, we were fully exhausted.

But the majestic and roaring waterfall made us mesmerised and at the same time frightened. It was a mixture of fierce and beauty at the same time. There was no return train in the evening and we had to board a Goods Train to reach Kollem railway station.

Trekking on railway trek is banned in Dudhsagar



But that was altogether a different story. We came to know that trekking thru
Sunset at Calangute Beach, Goa
railway track was strictly banned now due to no. of accidents that took place on the track. Even getting down from train at Dudhsagar falls was prohibited. Railway police maintain strict vigil to avoid any possibility of mishap at Dudhsagar.

Only way to visit Dudhsagar was thru Geep Safari which started from Kollem Railway station. We decided to come back tomorrow to avail the safari.

There was a small temple on the other side of the station. The temple was maintained by railways. The priest was an aged and very simple person. We had a chat with him. He travelled throughout India and shared his experiences of this place.

We had a tea and snacks break at a local shop. After spending some more time when we returned to our resort it was almost dark.

Dinner and Duck Army



We had dinner at the hotel. The dining area was spacious and decorated nicely. But the dinner was ordinary compared to the price.

On the way to dinner hall we saw an army of around ten ducks. They were coming towards us. We were ignoring them, but two stewards cautioned us not to
Souza Lobo Restaurant, Calangute, Goa
proceed further since they would bite (kat te hai). We changed our track to reach the dinner hall.

After finishing dinner while returning to our cottage suddenly we heard a huge noise. We noticed that the “Duck Army” were chasing two girls and they were running towards the garden. Possibly there was nobody to caution them or may be they ignored it. On the whole it was an interesting episode to watch.


15TH APRIL, 2016 – STAY AT DUDHSAGAR, MOLLEM



It was the penultimate day of our tour. Todays program was to visit Dudhsagar Falls thru Geep ride from Kollem station.

Loss of our APPLE IPAD – A big blow

After breakfast, we reached to the car parking area at around 9’O Clock to begin our journey towards Kollem railway station. After reaching there, I found that I forget to bring the car key. My son was carrying our APPLE iPAD, since the car was locked. He kept it outside the car. Munia came back with the car-key. That was the last time we saw our iPAD.

We started within a few minutes and at Kollem Railway Station we realised
Parasailing at Kolva Beach, Goa
that the iPAD was not with us. We searched the car, but could not find it. Immediately, we rushed back to the resorts, searched every nook and cornered but in vein. We complained to the hotel authorities. They showed us the CCTV footage at the gate showing our car going outside the resort. But the iPAD was lost for ever.

Apart from its cost, it was almost a member of our family. Hundreds of photos, whatsapp, google map, internet, facebook all gone leaving a big vacuum. We suddenly realised our dependence on this gadget. We were extremely disappointed and not getting the energy to continue our visit.

Afternoon, we resumed our plan and reached the spot from where the Dudhsagar Geep safari starts. On the way, the Kollem Police Station was spotted, but the iPAD sl no. and other details were required for making a loss report to the police. Unfortunately we did not carry those details.

Jeep Safai to Dudhsagar falls

When we reached the Jeep terminus, already no of people were waiting. One jeep could accommodate seven passengers. Total duration of the ride would be three hours, one hour each for ongoing and return.
Big Foot Loutolim Museum Goa 2
Balance one and half hour was for enjoying at the waterfalls. Cost of safari was Rs 450/- per head. Interestingly we were directed to compulsorily wear a life jacket while riding Jeep itself. It was so hot outside, thus we were surprised and it became little inconvenient also.

It was a bumpy ride throughout a kachha road inside the dense forest and mountains on the horizon. Dudhsagar river was often seen on the left side and the railway track on the right. Twice on the way the geep came down the stream, since there was no road bridge on top of it. The scenic beauty was excellent to watch and enjoy.

The jeep driver was very friendly. He informed that around 300 jeeps were engaged in this safari tour. He usually used to get a call once in two to three days, but allowed for a single journey only. Hundreds of local people are engaged in this activity. Definitely this ride boosted the economy of this area. The ride remain closed during monsoon for four months beginning from June to September.

Asking about the railway track trekking, he seemed to be against it since it was illegal
Basilica of Bom Jesus, Goa
and also it used to affect their livelihood. He further recalled that earlier he used to take tourists from Kollem to the waterfalls thru a very narrow walking route just adjacent to the railway track by motorcycle. I remembered to have seen that during our earlier visit. That ride was not only difficult but highly risky also.

Swimming at Dudhsagar falls

We reached the waterfalls at around 2 O Clock. Flow of water from the top was very low. Compared to the veracity of our earlier experience, it was like a skeleton. There was lack of rain last year in several parts of India including this region and even this year too.

Dudhsagar was a multi-tired waterfall and the railway track passed thru the middle portion of the waterfall. We reached to the bottom of the falls from where a beautiful panoramic view of the top, railway track crossing the falls, the surrounding western ghat mountains as well as the green forest were visible.

Compared to the very hot and sunny atmosphere, the cool water was a pleasing contrast and difficult to ignore. My son had a refreshing swim in the waterfall. Importance of the life

jacket was now understood. Water level was quite deep in certain points, but with life jackets every one including small children were enjoying the swim in cool water. It was extremely delightful.

We came back to Kollem rail station at around 5’o Clock and refreshed ourselves with cane juice.

Tamdi-surla Temple

The localites in the tea shop (located opposite railway station) advised us to visit this temple. Distance was around 30 Kms and it was located on the other side of the main road (NH 4A). The road was two lane (sometimes narrow) but well maintained. There were indication at important points to locate the destination. Occasionally we were passing thru small villages.

A magnificent 12th century architecture



After nearly an hour’s drive we reached the temple at around 6.30 PM. The temple was located inside the forest area. There were few shops at the entry gate and the shopkeeper advised to rush to the temple immediately. We were lucky since the temple gate keeper was just locking the gate.

He re-opened the temple on our request. We had the darshan of Lord Siva. According to the inscription outside the temple,
Casino Cruise at Mandovi River
this ancient siva temple was built during Kadamba dynasty in the 12th century. The temple was small in size but its architecture had been magnificent. Most noteworthy was its exquisite location which was inside the forest and surrounded by western-ghat mountains.

Nice Country-side Dinner

On the way back to the resort we decided to finish our dinner. A small hotel on the road-side was selected. Hot chapatis were served with dal, sabji and fresh Anda Bhujia (fried egg). It was a delicious treat at less than half cost.


16TH APRIL, 2016 – MULLEM TO BANGALORE – 570 KMS


We came to the last leg of our journey. I thought of beginning the journey in the early morning to avoid the summer heat. But having breakfast, carrying enough water/ other liquids and checking out from hotel took time. Nevertheless we started at 9 ‘o clock.

NH4A where the resort was situated and thru which we were proceeding was going towards Belgaum, Karnataka. Immediately the road entered the “Bhagawan Mahavir Wildlife Sanctuary”. There were thick green forests on both sides of the Ghat roads. The scenic beauty was extremely pleasing.

On the way we
Dudhsagar Resorts Dining Hall
came across several railway crossings. There were two toll gates also where we paid the levies. Very few vehicles were visible on the entire journey till we reach near NH4 (Mumbai Bangalore Highway). Also the road look deserted and sometimes we were driving miles after miles without seeing a human being.

After reaching NH4, it was a smooth journey towards Bangalore. There were two stops, the first one for petrol filling. The second halt was after Tumkur at Kamat Hotel to have snacks and tea. While enjoying the break, suddenly there were a brief storm followed by a down pour. We welcomed it since it had happened after a long gap.

We reached home at around 7.30 PM. The whole trip was pleasant except the unfortunate incident of loosing our dearest iPOD. We were loaded with memories which we would cherish for months to come till our adrenaline will force us to go for the next tour.

The speedometer clocked 2570 Kms for the whole trip. Approx total expenditure for the whole trip was as follows :

1. Petrol (150 Ltrs) - Rs 9,800,

2. Hotel tariff - Rs 8,200,

3. Food, Toll Charges,
Mystic moonlight Dudhsagar Resorts
Entry Fees and Misc. other charges - Rs 20,000

4. Total Rs.38,000

April 24th 2016
Published: April 26th 2016


I write this blog to help me remember things and to keep my friends and family updated on what I'm doing. I write a lot of chatty stuff so it's best if you know me (my friends say they like the chatting because it reminds me of how I talk... which I'm not sure is a good thing!) but anyone interested enough is welcome.

Friday 23 April

Friday evening we watched Slumdog Millionaire (can relate to it a bit more from here) which reminded me to write about the TV censorship. It’s pretty strict. There are some words that are ok… some that are not ok for example if the f word is used it’s muted out, if the s**t word is used the English subtitles on the screen (always present, even when the TV is in English) replace it with ‘damn’. There’s also no sex and violence… but the definition of violence is very unclear (some things you expect to be censored are not and vice versa). There are also a lot of public health warnings… if there’s anyone smoking (even if it’s so far in the background you can barely see them and only when you’re looking for it)) or drinking alcohol a “Smoking/Drinking is injurious to your health warning comes up”. The next season of Game of Thrones is due in a couple of days… no way that’s being watched on Indian TV! You can set up something called a Virtual Proxy Network (VPN) so you want watch TV as if you were in another location… it’s legal when you’re watching TV that you’re paying for… e.g. through a TV licence or satellite subscription. So Brian is going to set up a VPN based in the UK so can watch my TV from there (e.g. Sky Go, iPlayer).

Saturday 24 April

Today we had a day out of the city visiting Mysore, about 1 ½ hours away without traffic… 3 hours with Bangalore traffic. The traffic is so so frustrating but you do go slow enough to notice what’s going on, there’s always something interesting like cows pulling carts and people riding horses in the city traffic. The most random thing was on a 2 lane highway, with a concrete barrier in between, a car making its way very slowly amongst the traffic… on the wrong side of the road, in the wrong direction. It must have taken a lot of bottle given the amount of anger being directed at the car! We asked Noor “why????” and he just said “they’re crazy”.

We stopped for breakfast at a kind of service station. We had no idea of what to order but went for Dosa which was a kind of breakfast pancake. Mine was plain and Brian’s had masala on it, both were really nice, I’d have just liked jam on my Dosa J Noor had something that looked like a huge Yorkshire pudding… I want that next time!!!

Once we were way out of the city (and there was less dust!) the journey was nice. Lots of palm trees, sugar cane and rice fields that got lusher and lusher. We passed through the odd town… with people selling fruit between the cars (reminded me of Uganda) and in one a park where so many people were sleeping. I’m not sure if they just slept there or were chilling out.

In the Mysore area the countryside was idyllic. Our first stop was the ‘Gumbaz’, a tomb and mosque built as a tribute to his father by Tipu Sultan, who was once ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore. To walk around the tomb, we had to take our shoes off and deposit them in a box for safekeeping which wasn’t great, not because I thought we’d lose our shoes but because the ground was hot enough to burn our feet, they put some carpet down but it still wasn’t a pleasant walk. We felt uncomfortable inside the tomb itself as it looked like a place of workshop and neither of us would have known the right etiquette. Brian got asked for a photo… I thought it was a scam (seen it before) and left him to it (he’s not stupid) but then realised it was genuine… he was like a celeb (he’d said it happened a lot in China). I was bit put out nobody asked me for a photo… until 5 minutes later when they did (someone told me later they ask the man first before asking the woman, the mans in charge). I was like a celeb too! J

After that temple we stopped a bit further down the road at a ruin surrounded by a river, in which many Indians were swimming. Brian said it was a shame he hadn’t bought his trunks but they were all fully clothed so he’d have been ok… We sat on the side and dipped our feet in for a while and then before I knew it a group of women and children had approached me and were encouraging me in the water. I wasn’t naïve enough to thing I’d get away with just standing in it but I didn’t have the energy to argue so I pulled my long dress up above my knees (probably not appropriate) and stood in the river. Then they encouraged me further out into the river, it was only about 10 metres away but such a difficult walk, the water wasn’t clear and there was a lot of rubbish in it (I wouldn’t have got in if I thought the water was dodgy) and the rocks were really slippery. The locals were trying to get me to go faster but I really don’t know how they could without falling over. They were also trying to pull my dress down; I didn’t want it to get wet but I gave up. The next thing was getting me to sit down… it’s unusual for me to get in water with my clothes on so I was reluctant… so they splashed me! A lot. I kept my mouth shut and in the end thought well I’m wet now so might as well and got right in (it was actually quite nice because it was so hot!). I stayed there a while and noticed that Brian was taking photos (typical, the one time he decides to take photos) and made my way out. I was drenched!!! If I look like I’d been dragged through a river in my photos… it’s because I was.

Back in the car we headed into Mysore to the Mysore Palace… it wasn’t open until 4 (I’m not actually sure that was true, think a local just wanted us to go shopping!) so we went to a silk shop where I bought a nice scarf as a present (I thought pashmina was a style… it’s a fabric?!) and Brian got measured up for a shirt we were to go back and collect later.

Back at the palace we paid our entry (about 40p for locals, £3 for foreigners). It was quite nice to look at, with the Hindu temples surrounding it. It was really crowded inside, we were herded around and every so often a whistle would go telling someone off, I wasn’t always sure why but think it was because they weren’t moving quickly enough or because they were taking photos (which then got deleted by security). It was pretty inside though, colourful tiles on the ceilings and gifts and ornaments from around the world. You got a sense that this was somewhere that the Indian royalty would greet guest and put on a good show.

Back outside we got our shoes back and went for wander. We came across some camels and elephants you could ride. One of the elephants came right past of us and they were so so so big. I was conscious they’re big and can turn. Brian found them interesting and after a while of watching I realised he REALLY wanted a ride on one… we both weren’t sure about how well they were treated but they looked well cared for and were treated nicely so we decided to go. I got the queue whilst Brian got the tickets (100 rupees, £1 each). Before we knew it we were on the elephant. I was scared at first (it was so high!) but it moved at a slow although uncomfortable pace. The guy ‘driving’ told me to give him his camera (I thought I was in trouble for taking photos) but it was so he could hand it down to someone to take photos. So then we spent ages posing for photos (not impressed!) but I guess they tell a story. Once back we got off and went to find Noor.

We needed something to eat with a quick turnaround and after a bit of driving we found a restaurant called ‘Tal’ – it wasn’t much and wasn’t the sort of place you’d normally think to go into, very dark and basic. We were the only ones in there and I don’t think they’d had western tourists for an age but I went with it (Brian wasn’t fussed, happy to eat anything). There wasn’t a menu, they listed five dishes for us to choose from, and there was no beer, but we got there with an order (and they got the no onion message for me) and waited. It was with us in about 10 minutes and taught me not to make a snap judgement because it was amazing. They were so attentive and chatting to us about where we were from.

After dinner we went back to the palace for the ‘sound and light show’. I knew they’d be a story of Mysore’s history supported by light and sound show, but the main event was the palace being illuminated for 5 minutes at the end (most of the information you find online about the palace tells you it’s only illuminated on Sundays and Public Holidays for 45 minutes, that’s not entirely true… it’s also lit for 5 minutes at the end of the nightly sound and light show). Inside there were plastic chairs waiting and we got a good viewpoint. The light and show itself starting off pretty impressive, lots of booming lights and there was obviously a good story going on, but Brian and I had no idea what it was. I got ‘British’ and ‘Raj’ at one point but was that it. I loved it at first, found it all quite exciting but after about 10 minutes it was a bit repetitive… it would have been alright if we’d known what they were saying. After 40 minutes we were rewarded… with the palace being lit up. That was pretty cool.

Our next stop was to collect Brian’s shirt from the silk store. It wasn’t ready (we were early) so I went to buy beer from the store across the road but came back scared as the road was hard to cross and several people had stopped to ‘chat’ to me. So Brian had to come help me. At 8.25pm (just before the deadline!) the shirt cam but it did not fit. Brian couldn’t move his arms above shoulder height… I couldn’t help laughing out loud when the guy told Brian “it’s ok if you don’t lift your arms up” and Brian responded with “Yeah it’s fine… if I don’t use my arms?!?!?!”.

The drive home took nearly 3 hours, more traffic than usual. There wasn’t as much to see but some temples were lit up and it looked like there were a lot of parties going on. Noor did a great job but must have been tired. Back in the city we got pulled over for a random breath test and learned later that if a driver is caught at night it’s a 1000 rupee fine (about £10) and then you’re on your way.

We got home really late and I felt bad for Noor who still had to get home but we’d all had a good day.

Sunday 24 April

We had a lazy morning (I still have to study) and were ready to go out for breakfast when a knock on the door came. It was my neighbour Marcus coming to introduce himself. We had a lovely chat and he invited us out to lunch with the other neighbours we’ had dinner with the week before. We walked to the Om Made Café which did really nice salads, and flat breads and sandwiches. It was really cool and made me see how a settled life could be here. Marcus had so much information that was useful to me for Uni I didn’t feel like I was so bad for delaying studying.

After lunch Brian and I walked to the Oasis Centre to get some supplies. We had a lot of stuff so got our first auto rickshaws in India (tuk tuk) and got screwed on the price… paid £1 when should have paid about 50p but it was fun.

After chilling and some study (me) for a bit we met up with the others from lunch for drinks on the roof at sunset, it was so nice, I love a good sunset. After a few more drinks and a lend of some books from Marcus for Uni we were back in the apartment for dinner.

Whilst I was writing this and we were watching a film the power went. It’s worth a mention because the power goes all of the time, sometimes several times an hour. It’s not so bad as within seconds the generator turns on the lights but it takes a minute or so for the TV to turn back on and a few more minutes for the Wifi to restart (frustrating when I’m working or Brian is gaming and we get disconnected) and about 5 for the aircon to come back on.

Anyway time for a rest, work again tomorrow.

Lots of love!

Published: April 23rd 2016


Me and Dave have split up for a few days while I go to see a friend, and he goes to see some things that I’ve already seen.

I was going from Chennai to Pune, which as one train journey would probably be around 33 hours! So I decided to make two stops on the way to break the journey up, Mysore and Gokarna are where I'm going to stop.



When we got back from Andamans I'd arranged to meet Raja in Chennai. It was Thursday when we landed back on the mainland. Dave said he wasn't spending anymore than one night in Chennai, which is fair enough! I wish I'd done the same. I spoke to Raja who's currently in police training, who said his only day off is Sunday.

Fair enough, I don't mind waiting around until Sunday.

It gets to Sunday morning, I get a call. Apparently Raja has to work today 'n'all! So I've waited around for three days for nothing, brilliant. The worst part is I can't get a train ticket to leave to anywhere until Tuesday!

Collectively I think I’ve spent around 17 days in Chennai on this trip! Which is enough for a lifetime. It's all my own fault too, I could've checked some decent places in the south out in that time, you live and learn I guess.



Eventually after what seems like ages it gets to Tuesday, Football Manager and Game of Thrones do get boring after a few days. The train to Mysore is only 10 hours. I checked online before I went for somewhere good stay and found a place called “Sonder”. 500rs per night in a dorm, but it's worth it. You won't get anything else with those facilities for that price. It's just outside the city centre, in a relatively affluent area, so it's nice and quiet. There's three dorm rooms, one for girls, one for boys and a mixed one. There's a nice chill out zone in the front garden with a hammock, and in the back there's some comfy chairs. The dorm rooms are A/C, there's hot water, it's very clean and the wifi is the quickest I've ever come across in India. Plus there were a few other travellers around to talk to.

Due to the fact I'm trying to save money and I've been here before I decided I'll just check out the inside of the palace, which I hadn't done before and just chill out.

Before I leave for the palace the guy who owns the hostel tells me to download an app called “Jugnoo” it's basically Uber for tuk tuks, so obviously the price will be a lot less. Me being clever just decided to go get a normal tuk tuk, who ripped me off. Then it was 200rs into the palace, fair enough. You can check out the normal section of the palace inside with this ticket. However, If you want to check out the residential wing too then it's an extra 285rs!

Really regret going in there and paying that. I'm not a massive fan of museums that just have pictures and weapons anyway, but that's all it was in both parts. Granted in the residential section there was some old furniture. I expected to have more freedom to wonder around the whole palace, but you're restricted to certain rooms and you have to follow a route. Unless you're really interested or rich I wouldn't bother. Dave didn't go in there either, I need my travelling partner back, I can't be trusted to budget alone, which you'll see in a moment....

I left the palace rather hungry. I should mention that I love fried chicken, and I hadn't eaten fried chicken in like three months. I had some that wasn't too bad on Andamans, but it wasn't really fried chicken. So I headed to KFC.

Last time I went to KFC in Mysore was when I was volunteering in a veggie village so didn't have access to meat very often, that time me and my mate had a 12 piece bargain bucket each and finished the whole thing. Not chance I'd be replicating such a feat, but four pieces and fries sounds good.

So I’m there thoroughly enjoying myself, but need the toilet. I told the cleaner to leave the food there and I was just going to the toilet. Obviously when I came back a full piece of chicken and half chips had been thrown. I was furious! Literally could've cleaned the c u next Tuesday out! No man should be coming between another man and his fried chicken!



I left Mysore after the Chicken débâcle headed for Gokarna. A little fishing town on the beach, it's quite a spiritual place. I've been there before on my last trip and stayed on Om beach. This time I headed for Kudle (pronounced “could-lee” not “cuddle”!).

Wow! I was surprised, after Andamans I thought any other beach wouldn't look so great....I was wrong! Beautiful beach again! Not as good as Andamans, but much better than anything I've seen in Goa. There was something about that place too, a certain feeling, the ambience...no wonder it's popular with hippies.

I stayed just right when you walk onto the beach, decent room for 300rs per night.

I didn't really get up to much there, managed to get the hammock up again, chilled on the beach, swimming and watching the sunsets. I was only there for one night, but I can imagine getting stuck in Gokarna, and I remember thinking the same thing on my last trip.





Anyway off to Pune to spend a week with a friend and see some ancient temples and caves!

Just reminder that I use this 'blog' to remember things for myself and to share what I'm doing with my family and friends… it reads best if you know me (and that I talk a lot about random stuff) but anyone who’s interested enough to read is welcome.



Monday 18 to Friday 22 April



Monday was my first day at the office… I was up early and feeling like the new girl… Noor was very punctual anticipating a 2-hour drive to the office (allowing for getting lost first time, which we didn’t which was great… Google maps can be very handy as a back-up to give reassurance you’re on the right track). There’s not much to say about the journey other than traffic… (most of my photos so far are of the traffic and cows for a reason… !)

I will be travelling to various offices in Bangalore and across the country but immediately felt at home at this first one. I really enjoyed my day, found it fascinating, and loved talking to the people. They have been so good to me, making sure I’m comfortable and giving me handy tips of everything Bangalore related and how to take care of myself. There are also some very nice and interesting views of Bangalore from the building.

Noor has been waiting for me at the end of every day. The journey home is about an hour and a half and I mix it up with some work, study and just watching the world go by’ the city is fascinating and as we drive home the sun is starting to set… it’s my favourite time of the day to travel. I love the little side streets that look like a city in themselves!

The cows continue to fascinate me… Noor has realised how much as when he sees them he gives me a heads up… (I will Skype you from the car one of these days Gem, Katie and Joanne… for the children!). They are everywhere in the road and cause such havoc! I thought they must be at risk of getting hit but apparently it’s more the people around them who hit each other to avoid hitting the cows. I’ve also learned that the cows have owners who milk them and sell the milk. They’re often eating from the rubbish though… not really sure how that works.

I have come home to a home cooked meal 3 days this week… all Indian food made from scratch from Brian (can take 3-5 hours). We’ve had Butter Chicken, a type of Dahl and Sweet & Spicy Balti Chicken. They’re all incredible… as good as I’ve had in a restaurant and I’m so grateful to him for helping me out. The leftovers also make a handy lunch for the next day… J Brian has also been out walking whilst I’m at work, checking out the local area… I gave him a recommendation for breakfast -- which turned out to be terrible… at least I won’t have to go to try it out now haha 😉 - and he found a really really nice cake shop so I had two nice desserts… the chocolate mousse was one of the best things I’ve ever eaten. Only thing is it’s not good for me… he’s been feeding me so well and I’ve not found a gym yet… It’s not easy to cook here, with the different ingredients and need to be careful preparing the vegetables (Lisa kindly transported some of the vegetable antibacterial wash needed when she visited Delhi… handing it over to Noor… to handover to me… I was so happy to see it because I desperately wanted to eat some fruit!).

One day we went out to dinner… Noor recommend the Monkey Bar which was another mash up of foods but again amazing… the prices of the dishes here often suggest they are small… when they are definitely not… we ordered 5 and after the 3rd had come I was thinking… this is really quite enough… but 2 more came. One of the leftovers made a good addition to breakfast.

On Friday at the end of the week I came home and successfully managed to arrive back in Koramangala (my local area)… stop at the shops… go into the Spar to buy some wine… and cross the road to get take away from Taco Bell and I did it ALL ON MY OWN. As I was crossing the road (not easy… the lights weren’t working and a motorcycle came pretty close to me…!) I thought I’m actually doing normal life stuff in India. It still took longer than I thought it would though… nothing is quick here so it’s best to just go with it.

I’m also getting used to having people helping me… (other than my parents… Mum and Dad I can hear what you’re saying now…!) Noor and I are getting there with how we both work… and my lovely maid is great, so helpful and Brian has been giving her instructions… not necessarily all the ones needed though as there are some interesting occurrences in the house … First I bought a Guernsey calendar from home and because I haven’t got anywhere to hang it yet… I leave it on the dining table open on April… every day I come home it’s closed again… I wondered how long it would go on for and Friday I came home and it was still open! Woo. Second… Brian tried to sort out the bed one day (something wasn’t quite right)… to find that the mattress was inside the duvet cover… (yes really, must have been hard work). I don’t blame her… not many people would still use a duvet in this heat. And Lastly she asked me to buy a doormat… I was bit tired on the day and went into the first store suggested… it was a fancy rug store (not a doormat store!) and I didn’t have many options. Due to the price… I spent £10 on the smallest rug I could find… which I thought would be acceptable as a doormat. Brian laughed at me but I put it down outside the door in the hope that it’d be ok… now every day I get home to find it somewhere different on the floor in the kitchen… again I’m not surprised… it does not look like a doormat. I found a very nice actual doormat in the Spar for £2.50. She did show me how to open the coconut that Brian liberated (it was still sat there on Thursday) and the coconut water was very nice! Mum… you also have competition with your laundry standards 😊

It’s Friday night now and it’s a quiet one… sorting out the house and watching Slumdog Millionaire. There should be some more exciting pictures from tomorrow… as we’re getting out of the city for the day! I really have to go and sort out my nails as cannot bear them any longer :/

Missing you all.

Bangalore was never on my target as a place to visit. As my interest is in places which are more touristic. However situations made me stay in Bangalore for over a month. It's a good city. I was staying in far off place from the main city so I was very happy as there was no traffic. One a good places in India to live in. Good technology in terms of daily life has been established here. Weather was just alright. It was summer but not too hot. To get taxi was easy due to the technology. Ordering food or grocery was also made easy due to the technology. Place is booming and bursting with technology and start up businesses. This soon will spread in India as well. The MTR concept has boomed as a food business. The flipkart has boomed as an online marketing business. OLA has boomed in transportation business. And the list goes on. Lots to learn from the city. It's the right time to invest in areas like Yelhanka and buy property. Soon the return is going to double. Now heading to Ooty. More to come soon. Until then Take care.

Hey all,

I’ve been asked if I’ll be writing my ‘blog’ again whilst I’m in India … so I thought I’d better J I’m not sure if I can remember how to do it… but here goes… I use it to remember things for myself and to share what I'm doing with my family and friends… it reads best if you know me (and can appreciate the rambling!) but anyone who’s interested enough to read is welcome.

Since I last posted about Uganda in 2013 I’ve been away a few times… a fantastic European road trip with my parents… New York to my good friends Kristen and Dan’s wedding, Dallas to see my lovely friend Lauren and California to see Brian. I’ve not posted blog updates for those but as I’m going to be living and working in India for 6-12 months I thought it would be useful again.

I was getting itchy feet again in the UK so when an opportunity came to work abroad without having to take another career break… I was lucky enough to be given a role in the team working in India. My boss Lisa has been here for several years, which is an incredible help to the rest of us because she has so many tips and is a great source of professional and personal support. Jane and Sharon arrived in India 2 weeks before me and are based near Delhi (Jane and Sharon are also both writing blogs… if you want to take a look I’ve put the links at the end of this, I love both their writing styles and they will have a different perspective to me) and some new people will join us soon.

I am based in Bangalore (or Bengaluru). I hadn’t been to India before the week long ‘recce’ visit we all came on in March (visiting Gurgaon near Delhi and Bangalore) but I really liked it. I didn’t experience as much culture shock as I thought I would (felt like a blend of South East Asia and Uganda) and I thought Bangalore had a nice feel to it, it reminded me of an Indian version of Brisbane (similar temperature!) and as I loved living in Brisbane I took that as a positive.

So the date for my relocation was set: 11 April. The run up to leaving was crazy… there is a lot to organise when you’re moving to a new country and it was more complicated than my last two trips because I had to sort out my house and keep up to date with Uni and Believe In Better’s (the charity I’m a trustee of http://www.bibetter.co.uk/) administration. The ‘to do’ list was pretty big and at times it was a bit overwhelming (that was mainly Uni, which tends to take over at the best of times). But with the support of my amazing parents (who I should have been paying as personal assistants), my brother and friends I got there.

Saying bye to people was, as always, very difficult and at times pretty emotional. My parents seem to be used to it now… and it was easier leaving this time already knowing I’ll be back at the end of June and again in September… The difficult byes were my friends children… I drove away from a few houses in tears after promising to Skype from the car when I saw cows in the road.

Monday 11 April – Home to Bangalore

Miraculously, it all came together on the morning I was leaving. We’d had a power cut the night before… which didn’t help packing… but we finished packing, sorting out the house and my car got collected 5 minutes before the airport pick up at 10am… once the 7 bags were loaded in the car (5 were mine…!) we were on our way to Heathrow. Everything at the airport went pretty well… had time for some shopping and a beer and the flight was on time. Brian wasn’t initially so impressed with sitting in economy whilst I was in business…(tee her!) but every time I went to check on him he seemed to be having an amazing time… having made friends with a steward who kept bringing him drinks…!

Tuesday 12 April – Bangalore

We arrived in Bangalore at 4.45am… and it was already 28 degrees!!! Immigration and customs were really easy… I had a work visa in my passport but Brian had to get a visa on arrival… you apply online in advance (Indian e-TV… supposed to be an easy system… but think filling in the form and uploading pictures took longer than it took to process…would suggest not leaving it till the minimum 4 days in advance) and then we were through looking for Lisa who had kindly come to get us at that time.

Lisa was waiting and swiftly located my new driver Noor… who seemed very efficient. It was really nice driving to the hotel as Bangalore was waking up. We arrived at the Leela Palace where we’d stay until the next day when my apartment was ready. I really love that place, it’s such a beautiful hotel and the staff are so nice, so was very happy to be spending a bit more time there. We had some breakfast then slept for the majority of the day… I did get up later to go for a swim - that will be my local pool 😉 – and then we went to the gym before meeting Lisa for dinner. We had a really nice dinner from the Leela’s Indian speciality restaurant.

Wednesday 13 April – Bangalore

Today was apartment moving in day… so after breakfast and getting packed up… Noor came to collect us to take us to my new apartment in Koramangala, a popular district for expats. I had been there before during the recce visit but knew the owner and Lisa had been re-furnishing and organising it. I was very impressed… it has plenty of space (a spare room for all you visitors…!), is very comfortable and has a good TV service.

After a look around so I knew how everything worked Noor took us to the local supermarket… which is a really big Spar. We had some trouble getting in… as the floor numbers on the building sign did not line up with what was actually on the floors… I’m so glad Brian was with me as I wouldn’t have had a clue what I was doing. We bought all of the essentials for the cupboards and a week’s worth of food for about £70, which was pretty good. They had an international food section with proper Heinz Baked Beans… a very interesting selection of eggs (eggs for the ‘heart’, eggs for the ‘brain’, ‘happy’ eggs) and huge bags of rice and lentils where you weigh out and pay for what you want. The selection of meat was noticeably different to home though… chicken, lamb, goat and duck advertised… no beef or pork. There was a good selection of wine… the Indian wine Sula about £6 a bottle but the cheapest Prosecco was £16! I guess that’s not that bad but it’s not a Tesco offer price…! I’m glad I kept the receipt… as they get stamped by security on the way out.

Back at the apartment we chatted with Lisa, managed to get mango on the sofa (that was me, typically clumsy), got the Wifi working and Brian cooked dinner – a really nice homemade Indian dish. We spent the evening watching TV (there are good channels… although they repeat a lot) and chilling out.

Thursday 14 April – Bangalore

Today was my first day working in India, albeit from home. It took a bit of getting used to the regular power cuts… and the impact that has on the Wifi (a generator kicks in immediately so the lights come back on but everything else takes some time) and slightly slower speed. During the morning various people turned up to fix things like windows and I met the maid Usha, who would come in to help 6 days a week (it can get quite dusty around here, so regular cleaning is important). Usha didn’t need much explanation and seemed the business, she knew her way around better than me.

In the afternoon I went off with Noor (on my own, eek) to buy Indian SIM cards. We first went to the UB City Mall… which had some very fancy shops and restaurants but no phone stores. Noor then found me a Vodafone on the corner of a random street… and they were incredibly helpful. I’ve bought SIM cards in pretty much every country I’ve been to… and it’s usually simple. In India they want a lot of information and proofs of ID. It took about half an hour and I walked out with 2… one for work and one for myself but didn’t really understand what plans I had.

I had a bit more shopping to do but because of the traffic (it takes a long time to get anywhere in Bangalore… most of my photos at present are of traffic) we had to get back to meet colleagues who were over from the UK for dinner. I got back to the apartment to find 4 new pairs of shoes outside… it turned out it was more window fixing… so we had to wait for them to leave before we could. We went back to the Leela (the Leela’s oriental restaurant this time) with two of my colleagues from the UK. It was great to see familiar faces and hear about their trip. We didn’t have a late night as was conscious that Noor needed to get home, we hadn’t yet had a conversation about late nights for him J

Friday 15 April – Bangalore

I worked from home again today, catching up on the last 2 weeks from being sick and travelling and preparing for my first week in the office. Once worked was finished we still had shopping to do and I had to top up my phone… as had used up credit already (obviously should have understood that plan better in the first place!). After an hours travel to the phone shop… and a successful top up (I now do understand the plans, I’m not exaggerating when I say there are about 50 options) we were starving and it was too late for the shops… so we asked Noor to take us for dinner.

Noor said he’d take us somewhere to try… and if we liked it we could go again and if we didn’t we’d go somewhere else… It was amazing. I couldn’t figure out what the restaurant was called (it had a really long name that was almost like a saying) but it was next to a place called Fisherman’s Wharf. The food was like a fusion of Indian and American and it felt like a fancy sports bar (or even like Frankie & Benny’s) and was showing the IPL, quite exciting when you’re in India (we drove past the stadium earlier, Noor suggested we go watch a game). The food was incredible and very cheap, we would have spent about £6 each on 2 courses if it wasn’t for the drinks… of which we had a few because they were very nice cocktails.

The drive back at night was really nice, you don’t get bored even in the traffic because there’s so much going on to look at.

Saturday 16 April – Bangalore

Today was supposed to be a productive day! But we were tired so it wasn’t so. I went out with Noor to get us brunch, it wasn’t great but at least that’s one café I now know not to go to.

Later in the day we went out with Noor to get to the shops (eventually, had been trying since Wednesday). Lisa had advised us to be very specific with our drivers about where we wanted to go… and I learned why today. We asked for a “supermarket, like the Spar we went to”. After about an hour’s driving we arrived at the ‘super-market’ to find it was literally a SUPER-market. It was a huge street market, with what seemed like everything you could think of to buy. Noor asked us if it was what we were looking for… and honestly I had my doubts (especially when I saw the live chickens in cages) but once we’d parked up and he took us around it was fantastic. At first I felt a bit daunted because I thought I should have had more clothes on (was wearing a T-shirt and knee length skirt) and it was really crowded but it was fine and one of the nicest shopping trips ever. Noor stayed with us and took us to the indoor fruit and veg stands, some really nice…some a bit suspect but we got tomatoes, pears, chilli’s, garlic, ginger... we then went over to a store that Noor’s Dad uses (through the goats… one took a shine to Brian and wouldn’t let him pass…). It had almost everything Brian needed to make the recipes he’d found. We also went to a beef market… we weren’t sure about the look of the meat so left that. The walk back to the car was cool, Noor said the whole place is open till 1am, it was starting to get dark and there was a big church that was lit up with lots of pretty lights. Noor left us at a corner to get the car… we bought fresh crisps (they were still warm). It was one of those times where you wish people from home were there, as you can never explain it.

On the way home we stopped for Taco Bell takeaway… no beef in these tacos… was all chicken, potato or veg.

Sunday 17 April – Bangalore

Today we took a walk to the shops… it was Noor’s day off so we were on our own… It took about 15 minutes to walk to the main shops… not too bad as that’s where the good gym is too. The Lifestyle store is a bit like Debenhams… (the brand sun glasses were much cheaper in India than the UK) and then we went to Spar to stock up. It wasn’t a bad walk… learned that the pedestrian crossings sound like police sirens when on green.

On the way back we stopped off at Barleyz… a nice brewery type place. The IPL was showing and for once I was the one explaining sports rules to someone (cricket, to Brian)! On the walk back we came across a cow in the road, it was so funny, there was a security guard trying to shoo it away from his store but it was having none of it and just stood there with the cars going around it. We stopped off at the Baskin Robbins just down the road from the apartment and I thought this is getting more like Brisbane by the day… there was a Baskin Robbins just down the road from where I lived there J

The rest of the day was spent unpacking… and getting the maids next day’s activities ready (washing… I was going to do it but couldn’t figure out the machine). Tonight we had dinner with the neighbours, who’d very kindly invited us around for delicious BBQ pork (got tips on where to buy meat). We went up to the roof terrace which is really cool... nice view and Brian liberated a coconut… am not entirely sure how he’ll get it open but we’ll see.

Anyway… to the office tomorrow.

Lots of love, miss you already.

Les rues fourmillent de producteur venant de toute la région et villages avoisinant Bangalore. Et vas-y que ça marchande par-ci et par là. Chacun essaye d’acheter ses fruits et légumes au meilleur prix. C’est le marché de Bangalore, un des plus gros de la région, très réputé aussi pour son commerce de fleurs.

On se faufile au milieu des gens, certains nous regarde avec curiosité, d’autre ne nous remarque même pas trop occupés à transporter les sacs de marchandise qui font deux fois leur taille et qui cache de toute façon leur visibilité.

On prend des photos, certains prennent des photos avec nous (surtout avec Alex en fait du haut de ses 2 mètres).

Le marché est juste immense et là, un escalier qui donne au sous-sol, qui révèle la deuxième partie du marché, aussi grande que celui en surface mais cette fois que des fleurs et pétales en tout genre.

On se marche dessus, certains nous sourient, d’autres prennent la pose et se prêtent au jeu de la photo, d’autres sont agacés par notre lenteur et notre capacité à se mettre en travers de leur chemin.

Une scène m’interpelle, un homme négocie avec un vendeur
homme au panier
de légumes. Je m’y attarde un peu, prend quelque photos de leur transaction. L’homme me regarde d’un regard intense. Je continue à le prendre en photo. Il finit sa transaction. Je pars continue mon chemin. Le même homme me fait une tape amicale sur le dos, me sourit puis continue son chemin.

En résumé, un marché plein de vie, qui fait perdre la tête par le nombre de situations et anecdotes alentours, un labyrinthe souterrain dans lequel les gens se marchent dessus, ou l’improvisation et la surprise sont les seuls moyens de capturer les différentes situations. Impossible de s’arrêter sur une scène sans gêner quelqu’un, il faut juste saisir sur le vif ce que l’instant nous donne et garder les meilleures cliches dans notre tête. Bref un lieu qui transpire la vie et qui se vit.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hassan
March 14th 2016
Published: March 14th 2016


Hoysala Architecture
The quest for the next, offbeat weekend gateway ended with the identification of Hassan, in the state of Karnataka. Since it was the month of October, to avoid the afternoon heat, we decided to travel in the night. The distance to be covered from Mumbai was 950 km and the estimated travel time was 16 hours with minimal pit stops.

After completing the day’s task we embarked on our journey at 16:00 hours and hit Mumbai-Pune Expressway. The city traffic on the Pune Bypass Road was dense and it took almost an hour to get out of it and reach Katraj Tunnel. Thereafter the road was good and the only delay was on account of the wait at the Toll Plazas. As we reached Satara, on Pune – Bangalore Highway, we decided to take a short break for the light dinner.

Pranjali Restaurant, on the Satara Bypass Road, seemed to be the right place for some authentic Maharastrian cuisine. Though not a very fancy restaurant, the Mutton Thali ordered by us was served at a lightening speed. Through my experience, I have learnt that if you are hard pressed for time and need a quick meal … opt for
Ornate Carvings
Thali, because most components of the thali are ready-to-serve, especially during mealtime. The meal was delicious.

The SUV engaged by us had a pair of drivers. Though personally, I do not like to occupy the rear seat, post-dinner, I did opt for a reclined seat in the second row. It was almost 10:00. Most truck drivers had parked their vehicles on the service roads for their meals and we could move much faster than anticipated on NH-4. Soon we passed Kolhapur and we were on Belgavi Road. The wide smooth road beckoned Lady Slumber, to be woken up early morning next day near Shivamogga for a quick hot steaming cup of tea. While we were asleep, we had crossed from NH-4 to Nh-206 and still 150 km to cover. The street-side tea, near the Bus Depot was very refreshing and we were ready to move on.

Around 9:00, we reached Channarayapattana, at the junction on Mangalore – Bangalore Highway NH-48. A filling break-fast was the need of the hour. As we took left turn for Hassan, a large food plaza appeared. Adyar Aananda Bhavan. This newest eater, was opened only a fortnight ago and is a part of
Serene Environment
the famous chain, by the same name, having a number of restaurants in South India. The food quality, hygiene and the service were excellent. We feasted on Dosas, Vadas and topped up with authentic, steaming hot filter coffee. Hassan was barely half-an-hour away.

We needed, no-frills, basic accommodation, for the night. We checked in at a centrally located Hotel Palika, in Hassan. It is the city and district capital of Hassan in the Karnataka state and blessed with fine weather throughout the year.

After freshening up, we started our exploration trip and the first stop was Hassanamba Temple. Hassan gets its name from the presiding deity of Hasanamba Temple. The Goddess of Shakti, Hasanamba has chosen her abode in the heart of Hassan city. She is perceived to be ever smiling (Hasya –Hassan). The people have strong belief that the Goddess smiles down on the devotees who worship her and bestows all riches on them. Inside the temple premises exists an ant-hill representing the presiding deity. The temple was constructed in the 12th Century during Hoysala dynasty.

The Hoysala Dynasty …. The prominent South Indian Kannadiga Empire ruled most part of Karnataka, in the period spanning from
Mythological Figures
the 10th century to the 14th century. That era is remembered for the developments in the field of art, religion and temple architecture.

The Hasanamba temple, constructed in the same era, is unique because it opens for devotees, every year, only for a period of one week. The day of opening is the Thursday after the full moon day in the month of Ashwin or Aswija, of Hindu Almanac. The temple closes on the day of Balipadyami, during Diwali. The week is celebrated with festivities and religious fervor. It is considered to be sacred to seek the darshan during this auspicious festival period.

The closure of the temple is marked with elaborate religious rituals. The offerings of flowers, water and two bags of rice (to last for a period of one year) are made to the goddess. The Nanda-Deep is lit and the Anna-Navaidyam is offered, prior to the formally shutting the temple doors. The annual chariot festival also takes place on the closing day of the Hasanamba temple during Deepavali.

It is a miracle that the Anna-Naivadyam remains warm and unspoiled, the flowers stay fresh and Nandaa-Deep remains intact. The ghee does not deplete until the
Detailed Imaging
doors are opened after one year. These miracles strengthen devotees’ belief in supernatural powers of the Mother Goddess.

At the entrance of the main temple, there is a temple smaller dedicated to Siddheshwara – Lord Shiva. It has self-manifested Shiv-Linga. Additionally, there is unique idol of a nine-headed Ravana playing the Veena. Every new moon day, devotees throng this temple to honor the devout nature of Ravana.

It is rather unfortunate that these ancient structures are grossly neglected. Archeological experts should be preserving these national heritage assets. A lot of cleaning up and repairs activities were on during my visit, in preparation of the opening of the temple later that month. It was sad to observe that ordinary granite tiles (2 X 1) were being used to plaster the walls. A grossly neglected monument … which comes alive only for a week every year.

It was the lunch time, we were looking for some good restaurant. While entering Hassan in the morning, we had seen Hoysala Village Restaurant. The word Hoysala appealed to us and decided to give a try. The restaurant, aptly named Belur, the erstwhile capital of Hoysala, had ethnic décor. We opted for Lunch
Temple
Buffer and the food was simply sumptuous. The authentic Karnataka spread was simply delicious … Neer Dosa, Egg Curry, Rice Kheer, Cucumber sweet, Papaya holige. The few dishes churned out at the live counter were very tasty. The bill was, though expensive by local standard, was fair for the delicacies served.

Later we drove to Belur, to explore the Chennakesava Temple. Belur was the original capital of Hoysala, which subsequently got shifted to nearby Halebidu.

Chennakesava (meaning handsome Keshav or Vishnu, in Kannada) Temple, is situated on the banks of the Yagachi River. This construction of this structure commenced during the Hoysala dynasty, in 12th Century. The Hoysalas employed many noted architects and artisans to develop a new architectural tradition, later came to be known as the Karnatak Dravida tradition.

The main entrance to the complex is crowned by a Rajagopuram built during Vijaynagar empire. The Chennakesava temple is at the center, facing east, and is flanked by the Kappe Channigraya temple on its right, Sowmyanayaki (Lakshmi) temple, and Ranganayaki (Andal) temple on left. The Garuda Sthambha was also erected during Vijaynagar period, whereas Deepa sthambha dates from the Hoysala period. The doorways to the mantapa have
Sculpture along the wall
on both sides an image depicting the fight between the mythical warrior Sala and a tiger, which was later adopted to be the emblem of the Hoysala dynasty.

The shrine has a life size image of Keshav or Vishnu, with four hands. Each hand holds an attribute; chakra, gadha, padma and Shankha. The entrance to the shrine has life size sculptures of Dvarapal. The walls are decorated with innumerable images and figures of mythological subjects, gods, animals, birds as also human beings in forms, such as dancers, musicians and drummers, all sculpted in sandstone with extraordinary details. The decorative ceiling is supported by a number of hand-chiseled ornate pillars.

The sculptural style is significantly similar to the contemporary temples in the Northern Karnataka and the neighboring Maharashtra.

A short drive from Belur, brought us to Halebidu, the regal capital of the Hoysala dynasty in the 12th-13th century. The city got the name, because, in the early 14th century, it was ransacked twice by the invading army of Malik Kafur. Consequently it fell into a state of disrepair and neglect and came to be known as old city …. meaning Halebidu in Kannada. However, the authorities have ensured that this heritage site is properly maintained and has become a major tourist attraction in the state of Karnataka.

The ornate temple complex, at Halebidu, was constructed during the 12th century. It has two Hindu temples, one each dedicated to Hoyasaleswara and Kedareswara. In addition there are two Jain Temples (known as Basadi). The temples stands on the platform called jagati which is typically five to six feet in height and can be reached by a flight of steps. This jagati provides convenience and render a good view of the wall-relief and artistic sculptures to the visitors. Two monolith Nandis are guarding the Hoysaleswara temple. Soapstone (chloritic schist) has been used as the material of construction, similar to the most other temples in the vicinity. An archeological museum housing artifacts of the era is also being maintained in the complex. The Jain Basadis too are equally rich in sculptural details.

These temples are most well known for their sculptures that run all along the walls. Hundreds of images adorn the walls and perhaps no other Hoysala temples are as articulate in sculpture as this one. An endless variety of depictions from Hindu mythology, animals, birds and dancing human figures are artfully sculpted with minute details. The interiors of the temples are relatively plain and simple except for the lathe-turned symmetrical pillars placed in rows.

There were a lot of domestic tourists as well as international tourists, who had reached here in large number of buses and cars. The shutterbugs were busy capturing vivid details of the sculptures. Few students of architecture were busy sketching on their scrapbook as a part of their college assignment. The selfie-seekers were there in large number too, trying to squeeze in as many as possible in a single frame. .

The evening had descended and it was the time for us to return to the comforts of the hotel and seek rest. We had opted for a simple meal for the dinner from hotel kitchen. It was palatable enough for filling the stomach and put us to sleep. The night temperature had fallen quite low and conducive enough to usher us in the thick blanket.

The morning began little late but we were up by the sunrise. The original plan was to drive straight to Mangalore for onward journey home. The local friend coaxed us to take a short break at Sakaleshpur, which was about 40 km from Hassan. We were told that it is the “the poor man’s Ooty”. Since the place was en route, we decided to give it a try.

A quick research on internet, yielded more information about this mystic place. The name Sakaleshpur, seems to have been evolved from the words “Sakal Aishvarya Purva” abbreviated as Sakaleshhpur, The literally meaning of these words denotes that the place is blessed with all kinds of wealth, the climate and the water. This hill-town is located in the Malnad region on the magnificent hills of the biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats. It has a temperate climate surrounded with lofty green hills full of coffee, cardamom, pepper and areca plantations

We left after simple functional breakfast & a steaming hot cup of coffee. The traffic was sparse on the Bangalore – Mangalore Highway. The public transport buses were carrying, to their full capacities, the local population to their places of work and students to their educational institutions. The farm laborers, both men & women, with their meals tucked in, were walking towards the nearby the farms. The road, lined with hedges of tall trees, looked magnificent. The weather was very pleasant and the temperature felt to be sub-20 degrees centigrade.

When we reached this picturesque hill station, located at an average elevation of 3100 feet, it was swathed in the morning mist. The chill in the air was accompanied with the scent of coffee and the air was as pure as paradise. The evergreen rainforest reserve, spread over 1000s of hectares, with sub tropical climate lashed by heavy rains in wet season, provides conducive environment of abundant growth of unique flora and fauna.

Our friend from Hassan had made an arrangement with an owner of a homestay to take us for a long walk through Arabica & Robusta coffee plantations, thickets cinnamon trees, orange orchids and rolling meadows. Large timber yielding trees provide shade for these coffee bushes. The view of Western Ghats from the top of the mountain was breathtaking and we could soak in the 360 degree panoramic view. After spending about an hour in the misty environment, we returned to the town market. At a small restaurant, we treated ourselves to a gastronomic lunch, before be bid farewell to Sakaleshpur, one of the 18 most diverse spots in the world in terms of flora and fauna.

After picking up few packets of Coffee Powder, we headed for Mangalore. We did wanted to visit Sakleshpur Shiva Temple and the for the Tipu Sultan built, but we kept them in abeyance for the next visit when we come back to visit Chikmagalur and Gomateswara. The 150-km long drive to Mangalore was scenic very through the ghats, opening new vistas at every turn. The sighting of the bridge over the Netravathi River, gave us a solace of having reached in the proximity of Mangalore.

The purpose of getting the glimpses of the world-famous Hoysala architecture was well attained and also discovered an unknown new hill station on the Western Ghats. Weekend well spent……

I thought Bangalore has lost its selling point of being a city of parks. Now every where you turn, park your car or stare at you see an IT company and the huge IT park that it is based in. There is always garbage around(mostly on fire since thats the best way one can get rid of garbage). Angry and frustrated people honking to get to place that they dred. The vehicles.. the restaurants that feed the non indigenous people. And lets not forget the posters - movies, death /birth anniversary , new year , eid, Christmas...wishes from the (I know my people) politicians and sometimes I don't even know why a poster full of people faces is put up!!

Thats all true, but Bangalore has managed to hide a few gems away. Krishna Rao Park is one among them.

The entrance was small and so were my hopes, but when you finally figure out how big and beautiful it is, you will wounder around high(I surely did). You look up and the canopy of huge trees will make you smile. The floor is just as beautiful as the dry leaves are left to scatter around. They also are
IMG_20160225_172454639_HDR
required for the dogs to huddle up in. The trees are named and origin mentioned which wasn't much of interest to me. What was interesting is that with every turn the park opens up into something new.

The first thing we spotted on our tour were the banyan trees that made the path way all wavy as their roots sprung underneath. I tried to climb the tree but wasn't wearing jeans that would make that comfortable. I recommend standing close to the tree and patting it. It sounds just like patting an elephant. The texture is similar as well. I don't know about anyone else but elephants have always been a source of wonder and awe to me and the banyan tree came pretty close.

Then we walked towards a jack-fruit tree that made a prefect umbrella-picnic spot(minus the umbrella as the tree acted like one). Thats when I spotted some small unripe jack-fruit and they are slightly hairier and softer than what they grow up to be.

There was a kids playing section and a gym section. Before you get excited the girls/ladies in our city exercise in sarees and burka. There were all other sports
IMG_20160225_172517870
being played as well - cricket(our favorite), badminton, foot ball ...

The best part was the range of trees at the edge of the park that stood like the choir (close together) and almost sung. They were a prefect place to sit, talk and emote without worrying about the joggers and fitness freaks looking on(they mostly were listening to music anyway).

So, Please visit and look at Bangalore as it was. As it should be.

I'll keep this short as we haven't actually done anything in these two cities...

As I mentioned at the end of my last blog, we were heading for Bangalore which is a pretty developed city.

We'd read in the guide book that night life was an actual thing there! Which makes a change considering in most cities everything is closed for around 11PM. Apparently micro breweries have become quite popular there too, I say apparently because we didn't see one, despite some searching!



We went out a couple of times and found that Indians don't know how to dance in night clubs...they do some really weird stuff, even by my standards. We learned that “dance bars” are actually an Indian take on a strip club/brothel and I vomited AGAIN! (It was from too much Vodka though, so it doesn't count)

The guide book suggested Bangalore is home to some “English style” pubs. Obviously we had to check those out. Turns out they were actually quite good set ups, I'd definitely drink there at home above some of these new fancy bars. Nothing better than vintage 70s carpet (or older).



While we were in Bangalore we'd regularly been calling the boat depot in Chennai to find out when the next boat to Andaman islands was and when the tickets were released. India being India, you can't book the tickets online, or over the phone, you have to go to the booking office. No one knows when the next boat is leaving, how long it'll take or when the tickets are released for any boats other than the next one. Nor, for that matter, is there any pictures of the boat anywhere!

We decided to go to Chennai until we had the boat ticket to make the whole ordeal less stressful, and missing the next one would mean Cam wouldn't be able to come.



We stayed in “Paradise guest house” in Chennai. The guy who owned it is probably one of the only Indians I’ve met who understands customer service, very basic and cheap accommodation.

We went and booked the ticket on the second day, luckily the tickets were out the day after we arrived. We set sail on 6th March on a three day voyage! I'm so excited, it's like a proper adventure!

When we did the research for the trip to Andaman there's very limited information online, not even a traveller's blog! So we have no idea what to expect. We've got the cheapest tickets (2382rs) so we're staying in the bunk. I'm imagining the worst and hopefully that way it can only be better...?



There's a couple of places just south of Chennai, Mamallampuram & Pondicherry, we're going to inspect while we wait for the boat. Mamallampuram has loads of ancient temples and man made caves, Pondicherry is meant to be “mini Goa”...either way, we're back at the beach!

Asia » India » Karnataka » Bijapur
February 22nd 2016
Published: February 22nd 2016


The best place to start this post is the bus journey to Bijapur. We'd booked the bus to leave from Mapusa (the closest town to Anjuna) at 9PM and were due to arrive around 7AM. It is officially a sleeper bus, so you do get a bed, but sleeping on these buses isn't possible! Take into account the natural swaying of the bus, gently rocking you side to side as you go to sleep. That sounds quite attractive to me, slowly drift off to sleep like the baby Jesus, rocking in his manger.

In reality, once you factor In the atrocious Indian roads you're spending 10+ hours getting thrown around a mattress (which is actually quite soft, the bed alone is better than most of the beds we've slept in so far), that's barely long enough for you, AND you have to listen to people talking, playing music loud etc all night long. Thankfully this time, there wasn't any ear splitting music rattling the windows.



The journey was especially bad for me. After a collective total of around seven months in India, I've finally vomited. A truly spectacular moment, worthy of ending such a streak. I don't know what caused it, I must have had food poisoning or something. Most annoyingly I didn't feel sick before I got on the bus! We got on the bus, had some rum, fell asleep. Next thing we're being woken at 2.30AM to have our ticket checked again! WHAT GOES THROUGH THESE IDIOTS HEADS?! I've not really mentioned it so far, but everything in India seems to defy logic. I can't think of any more examples off the top of my head, maybe I’ll try to keep a track and make it a feature on the blog “how stupid are things in India this week”.

Yeah so I wake at 2.30AM to this killer stomach ache. I retain, at this point, that if the conductor hadn't woke me up then I wouldn't have been ill.

I was basically sat awake shaking for a few hours before a magnificent vomlet all down the side of the bus.



Anyway onto the important stuff.



It was 6.30AM when we arrived, pretty much everything was closed. We consult the guide book and pick out the cheapest place, 200rs per night for a room, perfect. However, this was closed so we had to settle for “Sagar Deluxe” 500rs per night for three. How they get away with referring to themselves as “deluxe” I'll never know. It was by far the dirtiest place we've stayed the whole trip. Cam had bed bugs from some of the provided blankets, there was dust everywhere! I don't think they'd cleaned the place since it was built. The bathroom was disgusting, it was like a cross between the room from “the Beach” and hell.

When we pulled up we could see an ancient ruin at the end of the street, a slight silver lining.



If you're one of these travellers who want to get “off the beaten track”, Bijapur could be one of the places to come. In the whole three days that we spent in Bij (I'm going to call it Bij from now on because I think that it's overall more “street” and down with the kids) we must have seen three other white people, and they were at the main attraction. So we basically had all the monuments to ourselves.



If the ruins had better upkeep and were looked after properly it could be a major tourist destination. The guide book's summary of it being the “Agra of the south” wasn't wrong!

The Golgumbaz (100rs entry), Bij's most famous building, is a mausoleum for one of the Adil Shahis' previous rulers and his family.

What an impressive building! Similar in size to the Taj Mahal, it can be seen pretty much throughout the city (provided you're high enough to see over the rooftops). The size of the dome that crowns it, is second only in to St Peter's square in Rome. This fact alone is enough, surely, for more tourists to go to Bij! I really would recommend this place, especially if you're either in Hampi or have been before. Bij is the home to the Muslim empire that destroyed Hampi, and all around the area there's plenty of ancient structures etc for you to get your teeth into.



The other MUST SEE in Bij is “The Ibrahim Rauza” (100rs entry). Again it's a mausoleum for an old ruler and his family done in a similar vein to the Taj, in respect that opposite is an almost symmetrical mosque.

In terms of size it's not as big as the Golgumbaz, but in terms of beauty it's on a par with it. Like I said before, if these monuments were cleaner etc they could potentially be on a par with the Taj.

The rauza from the outside looks kind of similar to the Taj. A Muslim building with decoration that's current of the era it was built in, it wouldn't look out of place in the middle east. To the left was the mausoleum and to the right, in almost perfect symmetry, was the mosque. Amazing stonework decorates the exterior of the building, with Islamic calligraphy from the Koran engraved into the walls.

Just outside the reach of most bus parties, so you have the place to yourself, it's a definite must see!



The Gulgumbaz and the Ibrahim Rauza are the main events in the city, but there's also some other structures to go and see. Any guide book or local map will show you where they are. I'm not sure if we managed to see all of them on account of stumbling across some ruins, which happened to be the coolest thing we saw.

In the middle of the city, near the citadel (also worth a visit), we must have walked east for about ten minutes towards a mosque that's listed on the map. We found what was probably an old barracks or somewhere that wasn't too important, it was falling apart and all overgrown with weeds and thorns. It joined onto part of the old castle walls, we must have spent around an hour wandering around. It was a sense of freedom you just don't get with the other monuments, being able to just go where you want. There's so many stairways and tunnels that are closed off in the other places...WHAT ARE THEY HIDING?!



As anyone who's been to Asia before will know, the locals love to have a selfie taken with a white person. Recently I've been playing with the idea of charging 10rs per photo, everything's for sale in this world right?

So being the capitalist pig that I am, I decided to put the “idea” to the test. Two Indian boys walk over and ask for a selfie, after about ten minutes of trying to communicate that I wanted 10rs for the picture, we finally struck a deal. He crossed my palm with 10rs and he got his selfie! If Dave and Cam both buy into it we'll be earning and travelling in no time.

At first there was a question mark as to the morality, however I decided that if they're willing give away 10rs then surely there's no problem? I was once told that India's biggest income is ripping off westerners, so I'm jut getting one back!



Aside from the obvious monuments etc Bijapur didn't have much to offer, a silver lining being great fresh fruit juice for 10rs. A very crazy standard Indian city, chaos everywhere. It's about bang on in the middle of the country too, so it was interesting to see elements of both the south and north. Given the Islamic monuments, the climate and the fact it's a Muslim majority city, Bij had a kind of middle eastern air to it.



With Cam's pockets getting smaller due to it being near the end of his trip, we've decided to cut some of the stops off through Karnataka in an effort to get to Andaman as quick as possible. Bengaluru, or Bangalore as it was once called, is one of the most developed cities in India, either on a par with Mumbai or not far off.



So that's our next stop, according to the guide book we can sample some cheap ales too!

16/02/16, in hind sight an overnight bus was the better option, though a scenic train track through the heights of tropical forest however being one of the standing sardines in a thickly packed out second class coach (fit with crazy man lock & chained to a bar) for a delayed 8 hours wasn't so romantic as planned! Cruise into Hampi by local bus from station and enjoy a further 3 full days foot & cycle exploring not just a monolithic pick'n mix of temples, structures and grand enclosures yet a fully qualified horizon gulping landscape of river, rock and ruin. switching 300 rupee digs daily to spend the first exploring the temples north of the water with the latter two exploring all major sights by foot & bike in the south. 20/02/16 after my first night sleeper bus (pretty good comfortable ride) I arrive in Mysore at 7am, bus to Aseem's house (my couch surfing host) and return to town for a day spent visiting the Mysore Palace, surprisingly high standard Zoo & super groceries Devaraja Market. Finish the evening with pizza & silly card games back at Aseem's.

I have seen nothing but view from above and airport. India people are very nice, but it's easy to make them feel ofended. It's hard to understand their body language sometimes, mainly becouse of the way they nod.

Nie zobaczylam nic poza widokiem z góry i lotniskiem. Hindusi natomiast są z reguły bardzo mili, ale łatwo ich urazić. Czasem ciężko zrozumieć ich mowę ciala, głównie ze względu na sposób w jaki kiwają głową.

Charette
Sortie de Bangalore, la premiere campagne
Que c’est bon de sortir de Bangalore ! Que c’est bon de sortir de cette folie meurtrière qui ne dort jamais !
Plus on s’éloignait, plus les bruits de klaxons se faisaient rares et plus les gens roulaient à peu près normalement. Je pense qu’a un certain point, Dilip, notre chauffeur, en tant que bon Citadin de Bangalore était le seul à klaxonner et a conduit dangereusement. Toujours ce bon vieux réflexe du mec presse et impatient qui contrastait parfaitement avec l’attitude « Shanti », c’est-à-dire tranquille et paisible des personnes habitant la campagne.



Arrive aux alentours des premiers villages environnant Hampi, On commence à sentir l’histoire qui entoure la région avec des villages complets reconstruits sur des ruines encore apparentes. Certaines rues sont définies par un axe de destruction des murs des maisons. Comme si sur 100 mètres un gros bulldozer avait coupé toutes les maisons en deux et que les habitants avaient juste décidé de vivre dans la pièce restante de la maison, laissant à découvert les murs détruits. Visuellement c’est l’impression que ça donne.
Hampi est en fait une ancienne cité riche et prospère et qui a été détruite, pillée et abandonnée il y
guest house
a quelques siècles. Ce qui a laissé un ensemble de ruines, de temples et bâtiments magnifiques au milieu d’un paysage luxuriant et grandiose. La plupart des gens vivent de l’agriculture par conséquent de vastes champs de rizières remplissent le paysage avec quelques nombreux cocotiers et bananiers. C’est vraiment magnifique à voir et donne une impression de liberté et de démesure.



Ça fait du bien de pouvoir visiter des lieux un peu plus authentiques et charges d’histoire, bien que de plus en plus touristiques. Et encore pour nous ce n’était pas le pire car ne nous n'avons visité que la partie nord qui est la moins touristique, la moins grande aussi. On a passé 2 jours dans une guest house extra, avec une vue imprenable sur la partie sud justement. Notre 1er jour, on a loué un scooter et suivant un guide, on a visité un ensemble de temples et ruines situées à différents endroits de la partie nord.
Qu’est-ce que c’est agréable de rouler au milieu de ces rizières, les cheveux aux vents, au soleil, a 25 degrés, avec une circulation calme. On a redécouvert la liberté de déplacement et ça m’a personnellement donné envie de
Rive Sud
Vue depuis la guest house. Vue sur la rive Sud
m’acheter un scooter pour retrouver cette sensation et la possibilité de se faire des virées de temps en temps.
Bref, d’abord on s’est rendu dans un petit village, tout ce qu’il y a de plus authentique, fait de pierre, au bord de la rivière. On est arrivé au temple du village. En fait un ancien temple abandonne dont la salle des prières est construite dans la roche. Les icônes étaient encore là mais malheureusement y avaient beaucoup de déchets et l’endroit était un peu saccage. Le guide nous a raconté deux trois anecdotes mais devant l’état des lieux on avait juste envie de partir un peu plus bas et prendre en photo les femmes qui nettoyaient leur linge dans la rivière.



Ensuite, on a repris le scooter direction un autre temple. Cette fois il fallait marcher un peu plus. Le temple était déjà beaucoup plus grand, en meilleures conditions et surtout toujours fréquente pour la prière. On a croisé beaucoup d’Indiens : Le guide nous a expliqué que partout en Inde, si tu viens au temple, tu peux manger gratuitement. Il nous a montré des marmites énormes destinées à cuisiner pour des familles entières. En fait
Rive Sud - temple
Vue depuis la guest house. Vue sur la rive Sud
l’argent récolte au temple sert aussi à cela, car quand un prêtre prie pour toi et pour que le dieu veille bien sur toi, il faut donner de l’argent. Tu donnes ce que tu veux mais plus tu donnes plus ta vie sera bonne. Quoi qu'il en soit, c’est plutôt une bonne chose qu’il y ait un retour et ça permet à certaines personnes de mieux manger et puis aussi disons le ça fidélise a la prière. Parce que c’est bien beau la spiritualité mais le corps a besoin de se nourrir aussi. Et c’est quelque chose que les hindous ont vraiment assimilé. Peut-être que le jour ou l’église comprendra que le corps a besoin de se nourrir autant que l’esprit, alors les églises seront moins désertes.
Bref après avoir marche dans le temple, un peu plus haut dans la montagne, après avoir croisé quelques singes, dans une petite grotte, un prêtre à prie pour nous, nous a béni, et a fait beaucoup de trucs auxquels on n'a rien compris. Mais bon le rituel était intéressant et la discussion aussi. Après quelques minutes de méditation on est réparti sur nos scooters.



On suit le guide dans

a cote de la guest house
un petit chemin de terre, borde par un champ de bananes, on arrive dans une guest house un isolée et paisible. On a pris notre repas là-bas, prélassé sur les couchettes puis on est reparti direction le lac dans lequel on a fait un petit tour dans un bateau de pêcheur appele Coracle, un bateau noir rond, avec un rameur qui te fais avancer comme une feuille.
Pour finir la journée, on s’est rendu au temple d’Anuman, ou le « monkey temple » comme il l’appelle pour les touristes. Le temple est accessible après avoir grimpé 600 marches sculptées dans la roche, mais bon, on a vu pire et puis la vue vaut vraiment le coup d’autant plus pour assister au coucher du soleil. De toute manière la vue hallucinante et la présence des quelques singes le long des marches aident à oublier l’effort. Arrive au sommet on fait un petit tour dans le temple, puis on s'est rendu sur le bord de la falaise pour enfin prendre quelques photos de l’étendue d’Hampi et des singes qui courent aux alentours. D’ailleurs faire très attention à ses affaires car ce sont de petits voleurs. Aude a vu quelqu’un se faire
Meditation
premier temple, dans le petit village
arracher des mains un sac contenant de la nourriture.
Les animaux, sauvages ou pas, sont tellement respectes et sacres dans la culture Hindoue, qu’ils ne sont pas craintifs du tout. Ça n'empêche pas certains gamins de jeter des pierres ou provoquer les singes ceci dit, on fait des conneries à tout âge. Mais bon ça explique aussi les vaches blasées au milieu de la route, les chiens errant dormant au milieu du passage, les chèvres, et autres animaux. D’ailleurs aux alentours des premiers villages d’Hampi, des animaux jamais aperçus à Bangalore ont fait leur apparition. Le singe assis au bord de la route regardant les voitures passer, ou les cochons noirs cherchant à se nourrir au milieu d'un tapis d’ordures. Oui les ordures c’est partout apparemment, et les animaux fouillant dedans aussi. Pas étonnant que les vaches soient si maigres.



Après avoir assisté à un tel spectacle naturel au Monkey temple, on repart direction de notre guest house pour finir la journée tranquillement au restaurant. Mais là, c’est le drame ! Un alligator se jette sur Aude. Je me jette sur l’alligator et après quelques minutes de combat acharne je viens à bout de la bête.
Lessive
J’ai quelques bobos mais ça va rien de grave. Je dis à Aude « je viens de tuer un croco ! ... » (Pour la suite regarder OSS 117).
Bon en fait cette histoire de croco n’a pas vraiment fonctionné au boulot pour expliquer les blessures que j’avais à la jambe. Alors je vous le dis, cette histoire de croco est une invention. En fait, sur le retour à la guest house, après avoir redémarré dans un petit chemin de terre, et une accélération un peu trop forte, on est tombe en scooter. Forte heureusement on n'allait pas vite et ça aurait pu être pire vu qu’on n'avait pas de casque bien sûr. Au final, Aude n'a rien et moi juste quelques brulures superficielles a la main, au bras, et à la jambe. Rien de bien méchant, juste de quoi se sentir vivant. Et puis on est tombe du bon côté du coup les appareils photo n’ont rien eux aussi. Bref, la connerie 2 minutes avant de rendre le scooter. On remonte sur le scooter et on continue notre route jusqu’à la guest house. Le guide me dit de ne rien dire sur le fait que je sois tombe
Lessive - Riviere
sinon je vais payer très cher pour la location du scooter. Après un nettoyage rapide des plaies, le guide m’emmène en scooter au village pour me faire soigner par un homme qui semblerait être un pharmacien. Enfin, une bicoque de 5 mètres carres comme les autres, sauf que le mec a des médicaments. Il m’a mis toutes sortent de désinfectants jusqu’à ce qu’un produit me face grimaçer de douleur pour lui décrochant un sourire satisfait et moqueur, ou bien était-ce juste du sadisme.



Bref, une super bonne journée qui s’est terminée au restaurant comme prévu et qui ne nous découragera pas de reprendre un scooter lors de nos prochaines escapades, au contraire, avec plus de prudence cette fois.



Le lendemain, on était sur le départ, 7 heures de route jusqu’à Bangalore. On avait rendez-vous avec notre chauffeur sur la rive Sud car notre guest house était difficile d’accès en voiture. On marche une centaine de mètres au bord de la rivière et des marécages. Puis on prend un petit bateau pour traverser la rive. En 2 minutes on arrive de l’autre côté, sur les marches qui donnent dans l’eau. On commence a monter les
benoit riziere
marches et là on réalise que l'éléphant sacre de Hampi, Lakshmi, prend son bain un peu plus loin. À la base il était censé le prendre à 8h du matin et on pensait l’avoir raté mais par chance Lakshmi était là.
Le gars sur la photo est en fait en train de râler et m’interdit de prendre des photos. Du coup j’ai qu’une photo mais ça ne m’a pas empêché de laisser l’appareil photo pendre à mon cou et de filmer la scène, ni vu ni connu.
On traverse la cité à l’aide de l’auto rickshaw qui nous emmène dans des petites rues étroites au milieu des ruines, très authentique. On prend nos dernières photos, et en route pour Bangalore.
Sur le bord de la route on s’arrête pour boire de l’eau de coco. Un homme est là avec ses noix de coco accrochées à son vélo et triplant le volume de ce dernier. Deux coups de machette, quelques roupies et le tour est joué.



Dernière petite anecdote qui m’a bien fait rire. On est dans la voiture, direction Bangalore, Aude finit sa bouteille d’eau. Elle l’écrase, car après tout c’est marqué dessus. Le
Aude Hindou
Apres la priere, sortie du temple
chauffeur entend le bruit, il voit qu'Aude a fini sa bouteille et par gentillesse lui demande de lui donner la bouteille afin de la désencombrer. Aude, naïve, lui donne. Moi là je me dis, mais pourquoi elle lui a donné, sachant la facilite qu'ont les Indiens à jeter les déchets par terre. Après tout, ils en avaient fait la preuve tout au long du voyage déjà. Bref le chauffeur donne la bouteille à sa cousine qui faisait partie du voyage et assise à cote de lui. Et ce qui devait arriver arriva. Elle ouvre la fenêtre, et jette la bouteille en plastique. Je regarde Aude les yeux rieurs alors qu'elle est encore abasourdie par ce qui vient de se passer. Entre l’envie de dire quelque chose et l’impossible de le faire. Puis, par politesse elle parvient à prononcer un « thank you » un peu timide et oblige. Autant dire que ça m’a valu un bon fou rire de quelques minutes. On connaît tous la position d'Aude concernant la pollution et la gestion des déchets. Et là, non seulement, sa bouteille a fini dans la nature mais en plus elle a dû remercier quelqu’un pour cela. Ça m’a fait la
benoit hindou
journée.





Aller à la prochaine.

Bijapur is OTBT. Lots of the schoolchildren and adults wanted to take photos of us. They were far more more interested in us than in anything else, see the photo for an example of the school kids. Outside the Gol Gombaz our driver, Mr Kannan, joined us for a group photo. Some of these shots turned out well. Bijapur now is half Muslim half Hindu? Like all of southern India there is no tension. Some of the areas around the mosques are predominantly Muslim. The Gol Gombaz is not the prettiest building to look at, but it is imposing. It is the mausoleum of a Sultan built in the c17. It has the second largest dome in the world. At each corner of the building is a minaret. There is a climb up steep steps inside the minaret to the top. Here there is a view over the city. There is also the chance to enter the inside of the dome at the top. This is known as the whispering gallery. In fact no one whispers here. Schoolchildren shout and the echos reverberate around. It is a loud experience.

After a break for lunch we visite the Ibrahim Rosa. This is also a mausoleum with a mosque next to it. It is now a monument in gardens. It has been said that this building is a model for the Taj Mahal. Its glories are now a little faded, but the architecturis remains and is both symmetrical and graceful. There are traces remaining of the decoration. The mosque next door is simpler. It's arches reminded me of the bath houses in Iran.



Our final visit was to the Friday mosque. This has a mihrab with gold decoration. It was peaceful here with no school children.

There was time left for us to enjoy a walk in the area between our hotel and the mosque. This was a mixture of old small Muslim houses, a few colonial era houses and modern houses. in the area there were mosques in ruins, older mosques in use and shiny new mosques.

Today was a good example of an Indian breakfast, dosa which is like a pancake, coconut chutney, a potato dish and a dish with a kind of grain that is in texture more mushy than rice. I prefer Indian breakfast to Chinese breakfast.

On the way to Pattadakal there were many birds in the fields and on the overhead wires. The nests of weaver birds werehanging in the trees.

Pattadakal is a cluster of temples where the Chalukyan kings were crowned. Some of the temples were built in association with military victories. In date these temples come after the Badami caves. Pattadakal was a commercial centre and a meeting place for architects and sculptors from north and south India. The temples display different architectural styles. We are familiar with the Dravidian style which has tiers, but not with the north Indian style where the vimana is more rounded. This slightly rounded style allows rainwater to drain more easily. Some of the temples have been restored to some extent and some are unfinished. The sketches for the carving can be seen. At the far end of the complex are two temples devoted to two sisters who were both married to the king. The larger of the two is for the eldest sister. It is a living temple and has an undamaged and attractive Nandi in its own shrine. There was also a notable carving inside the temple of Parvarti killing a demon. The temples also included everyday life scenes, for example a lady receiving ayurevedic treatment.

We drove further on to visit Aihole. This has temples which are the earliest in date, prior to the Badami caves. Aihole has more than one hundred temples. Many of these temples were lived in until relatively recently. There are depressions in the floor of the temples where grain was ground and games are marked out. We visited one group of temples with our guide. This included an unusual apsidal shaped temple. The shape of this temple was not copied in later temple architecture, but many of the architectural features of these temples were copied and developed. Aihole is therefore known as a school of architecture. The very earliest temples did not have windows for ventilation, but the slightly later ones did. This development can be seen in therdifferent temples. I recognised the vertical pattern surrounding the door which was later copied in the Virupasha temple in Hampi. The first Harihari is also here. A Harihari is half Shiva, half Vishnu.

After our guide returned home walked in the village where the temples and houses are close together. The oxen sit happily just next to temples and the schoolchildren make their common requests, school pen, sweets, money.

There are many interesting tourist places in and around Bangalore worth visiting although not so publicised. Kokkare Bellur is one such spot which we decided to explore on the 26th January i.e last Tuesday.

Our destination was a village in Mandya District, around 90 Kms from Bangalore. The name was slightly difficult to remember for me.

Myself along with my wife and son started our journey at around 12 PM in the afternoon. Myself and my son were on the wheel alternatively. We selected Koramangala-Bannerghata route with a brief drive trhu Kanakpura Road. After around 24 Km we reached the Toll Gate (Rs. 32/-) of Nice Road.

It was a nice day with bright sunshine. After driving around 8 Km further, we took a left turn to Mysore Road. Mysore Road used to be very crowded these days, but luckily there was not much traffic that day, may be due to Republic Day. A few kilometres after Channapatna we took left turn to a small road going to the village. There was a small signboard for deviation which could be missed easily. Fortunately we had Google Map as our guide.

The village was around 12 Kms from
IMG_1127r
here. Road was well maintained, but there was a rider. Villagers spread straws at various places on the road. Some of the places the quantum was huge which might create problems for bikers. For car it was OK.

We reached the place at around 2.30 PM. Our first reaction was a bit disappointing. We thought there would be a large lake or a forest where the birds would have gathered. But there was nothing of that kind. It was a small village by the roadside. There were big trees all around the village. At first look, it was like any other village we see normally. Birds were sighted but not as imagined by us in the beginning. Also, we are not regular Bird watchers.

There was one Bird interpretation Centre of Government of Karnataka. Local village boys playing nearby said that the centre closed due to republic day. Then they requested for pens to donate, which unfortunately we did not carry.

Nevertheless we finished our late packed lunch, nicely brought. Luckily we met Lokesh, a local resident attached to the Bird Centre, whom we approached for guidance. He readily accepted. Only problem was language since our knowledge
IMG_1161r
of local Kannada language was elementary.

He escorted us to the trees where the birds nested. Pelican and Painted storks selected separate trees for their habitat.

Most of those trees were located in between the village huts. There was huge chattering sound from the nesting birds, but hardly any reaction from the villagers. Villagers were performing their day to day activities as usual.

Head of the adult Painted storks are bare and orange or reddish in colour. The long feathers are tipped in bright pink colour. Rest of thebody was whitish, whereas Pelicans are mainly white in colour. They nested in separate trees. Painted Storks were more in number, compared to the Pelicans. Both the species are of threatened category of birds.

Kokkare is the local name of the beautiful bird, the “Painted Stork.” Unlike the regular bird sanctuaries, this is not a place with a nature park dedicated to birds but is a small village which pelicans and Painted strokes have literally made their home.

Season for bird watching is from December to May, but March-April is the peak period.

This village is one of the selected breeding centre of those birds. The
IMG_1206r
village is also near to Shimsa River (a tributary of Kaveri River). Birds get their food supplies from nearby waterbodies. We came to know that villagers often feed the birds with fishes.

This place gained wide recognition particularly between conservationists and bird lovers due to the harmonious relationship existed amongst the villagers and the birds. The villagers adopted these birds as their heritage for decades.

It’s really exciting and pleasing to see numerous such birds roaming around, without restraint, in the heart of the rural community.

This little village is a wonderful example of co-existence between nature and humans. No word is enough to appreciate their contribution.

We thanked our guide Lokesh. He noted our whereabouts in a notebook. We spent there upto 4.30 PM and took a good number of snaps of the birds in their different moods.

On our way back, we decided to visit the nearby Shimsha river. We parked our vehicle after crossing the bridge. There were large sugarcane fields on the banks of the river. Overall it was a nice view to enjoy.

We noticed large size fishes swimming in the river. Also we met one of the Angling
IMG_1224r
enthusiasts from Bangalore trying his luck from the river bridge.

On the way we refreshed ourselves at Kamat Lokaruchi (near Ramanagaram) restaurant with Bhajjis and tea.



Overall it was an amazing experience.

This morning's drive was first along the fast road north heading to Bijapur. Men wereselling knives by the side of the road. The knives were curved in pirate style. An odd thing to see for sale as you drive past. On the quiter road to Badami the crops included peanuts and sunflowers. The harvesting of the peanuts seemed to involve pulling up the whole plant. We passed through a village where a festival hadtaken over the road. There was a huge amount of buying going on. This is a festival for the agricultural workers. The goods on offer included shiny new blue tractors. Toys, clothes, sunglasses, food snacks, and all sorts of household items were on sale. Not too different from a department store. There were also a couple of fairground rides and a dirty gypsy encampment nearby.

Badami is distinctive because of its sandstone cliffs. Unusually, there were pigs in the streets. We met our guide at the caves which are carved into the cliffs. Here monkeys were fighting over something, growling at each other. These caves date from around the same time as the Mahaliburapam caves and the art can be compared. These are from the chalukya empire C6 to C8. The first temple is dedicated to Shiva, the second and third to Vishnu and the fourth is a Jain temple. A particularly memorable image is one of the incarnations of Vishnu with his foot raised over the demon. The dwarf figures with their curly hair were also distinctive. The Indian tourist visiting the caves were very keen to have photos of me and Ginny, though I'm not sure why we were more interesting than the carvings and the natural patterns of the sandstone (or even the karma sutra carvings).

While climbing up to the caves we had a view down on the tank below. The tank is a large artificial pond. We saw it being used for washing clothes, pots and pans and buffaloes. The buffaloes looked clean and shiny when they emerged. I'm not so sure about the pots and pans. After the caves we walked round to the temple next to the tank, the bhutnath temple. This was very attractive in the evening light. The style of this temple was simple with only a few carvings.

The evening was quiet. There seem to be few guests here.

This morning we continued site seeing in Hampi. At the Virupasha temple monkeys are everywhere and one jumped on Ginny's back. There is also a temple elephant here. An unusual feature of this temple is that the architect included a window designed as a pin hole camera. An inverted image of the gopuram is clearly visible during daylight hours. This temple also includes small sections of the sanctum sanctorum dating back to C6 to C8. This is the same style of architecture we will see next in Badami. Although this looks black it is green chlorite stone.

We continued to the royal temple. The light was good for photographing the outside wall carved with a row of elephants at the bottom, then horses, infantrymen, dancing girls, and a procession. Inside there are scenes from the Ramayana. Surrounding the temple are the ruins of royal palaces.Conservation work is continuing. There are sections that can be easily identified such as the platform on which the king mounted elephants and a bathing area. The royal enclosure, a little further along the roadhas an impressive aqueduct and a royal pond with an attractive geometric design. We climbed up on top of the royal stage for a panorama over the surrounding area. The final visit before lunch (again at the mango tree) was to the queen's bath.

After lunch we enjoyed the air conditioning in the car on the drive to Arungundi hill. The drive included a very attractive section through rice paddy fields with Hampi boulder hills in the background. There were birds in the paddy fields helping the farmers by eating the insects? The small egrets were most prolific. There were also ibis feeding. Unfortunately a large (dead) bat was visible on a power line? On a different power line was a black and white kingfisher and bee eater birds.

We climbed the 650 steps up the hill to the view point and temple at the top. The view included the river and we could see the boat crossing to our cottages. We could also see the main Hampi temples we had visited. In the other direction there was a view over rice paddy fields and the boulders.

After our river crossing our first visit was to the Vittala temple. On the way we walked past granite pillars which mark where the market For horses used to be. This is one of the seven markets at Hampi. It was a huge metropolis with one million inhabitants. We also stopped at a water tank. There was a complex system of aqueducts and this tank was the water source for the market.

Vittala temple was quiet when we arrived and it gave a good opportunity to take photos. The highlights in the temple are the stone chariot and the musical pillars. The stone chariot is reintact in good condition despite the numerous fingers. Originally it was drawn by horses, but these are lost. Elephants found nearby were substituted. The mandala with musical pillars can has been closed to tourists because of damage to the pillars. The pillars are of slightly different heights and designs and they sound as different notes when they are tapped. Our guide demonstrated the type of sound made at a small mandala. He also showed us magic sculptures, for example one that wa five different animals, starting with a frog on top.

Our next stop
P1018660.JPG
was at the Lakshmi Narasimha. This is a large monolith sculpture of Vishnu in angry form with head of a lion and a seven headed cobra behind. Nearby is mustard seed Ganesh. From the back this monolith shows the back of a woman (according to our guide behind every successful man is a woman. From Ganesh we walked up forpopp good view over the river valley and Viruupaksha temple. We will visit this tomorrow. Up on the hill there were simple shrines from a much earlier period.

For lunch we sampled the ""Mango Tree"" restaurant. This is an iconic institution. Traditionally Hampi is a hippie backpacking destination.and the orange tree has retainfees little of that feel with 70s style art work and lights. It now caters to a whole range of tourists.

Our afternoon visit was to the ruins of the palace? The two best preserved buildings are the lotus mahal which was a palace building used for entertainment and the elephant stable. The lotus mahal was kept cool by a complicated water system pumped up to the roof. The elephant stable had three different styles of dome on the perhaps. An architectural flourish.

We saw a lot and it was hot, was we ended the day with a relaxing coracle ride on the river. It is a mode of transport new to me. We saw a group village refers carry out a water puja. They had travelled 200 miles to Hampi for this ceremony. Langur monkeys and red faced monkeys were close to the river, begging for bananas

The photos are of the stone chariot at the temple and the elephant stables.

Today was a long drive north to Hampi. There was a noticeable change in the landscape. Here it is drier, like a scrubby desert. The soil is a red colour and there are many collections of boulders. The boulders are ancient granite that over a very long time has gradually weathered. The road to Hampi included a fast motorway section that had very little traffic and an ordinary road that was very busy with lorries. On this section there were hardly any cars, just lorries. Accidents arecommon on this stretch. The lorries come from all parts of India. Their registration plates indicate the state they come from. Some came from Rajastan.

We met our new guide and he introduced Hampi and showed us Krishna's temple. All the temples at Hampi are ruins because the ViJayanagara empire was defeated by the Muslim Deccan rulers in C16. The ruins were uncovered by the British in the middle of C19. A big theme in Hampi temples is the Ramayana story. This story relates to Sita the wife of Rama being captured and taken to Sri Lanka.



The journey to uramma heritage where we are staying was interesting. It is in the village of Anegundi which is across the river from the main Hampi area. There is a very small ferry across the river. It takes motorbikes and foot passengers, but not cars. Cars can reach the village, but it is a very long way round. We took the ferry with our luggage. On the other side it was a very short tuk tuk journey to the cottages.

The Hoysala temples are star shaped and they have star quality carvings. Our first visit today had some connections with the Hoysala, but it is now a Jain temple. On the way we passed a large sugar cane factory. Most of the sugar cane is still taken to the factory by bullock carts. Outside the factory were lines of bullock carts and on the road there were more all heading to the factory.

Shravengabola is a Jain village. It is named after an ancient pond. On either side of the pond are hills, each with a Jain temple. We climbed the 650 or so stone steps up the tallest hill. At the top is a a granite simple temple with a huge granite statue.

After a lunch break at the hotel in Hassan we drove to Belur. This is a Hoysala temple, again in the shape of a star. It is particularly known for the sculptures of dancing girls that are in the place of brackets for the roof, one is shown in the photo. The temples are carved from soapstone. This is an easy material for carving and detailed filigree work is possible. Inside the temple are more dancing figures. The carving on these figures is so detailed that there are moveable parts, e.g. Bangles that move. One of the pillars inside used to rotate, but no longer does so. This pillar has mini representations of the carvings on the main temple, so small they are not easy to see. This would be a good place to inspire an artist.

Thelast temple was at Halebid. This is the largest Hoysala temple. A few sections of the carving were not completed. This means that you can see on the temple the process of carving from sketch, to rough outline to detailed work. The evening light was particularly good on one side of the temple. This temple is two temples combined, each has a sanctum sanctorum. On the side of the temple the sculpture is in horizontal Lines with elephants at the bottom, horses, scroll work, scenes from the Hindu stories, mythical beasts called makras and swans. An elegant nandi for each of the two temples is on the left hand side. Again this temple has fine filigree sculpture work and it is kept in good condition.

It was a one hour drive to Somnathpur. This temple been had some restoration work and is now in excellent condition. This is a Hoysala temple, different from the Chola temples. It was built slightly later than the main Chola temples in C13. It has a star shape which is specific to Hoysala temples. It is also soapstone, again specific to Hoysala. The first thing you notice at Somnathpur is the Hoysala motif. This is a man killing a tiger. The man concerned is the legendary head of the dynasty. The carving around the outside of the temple has a number of levels. elephants are at the bottom, then horses, then scenes from the Hindu stories (e.g. Ramayana), then mythical creatures, then forms of the gods, then the temple towers. Inside the temple there are attractive turned and carved pillars and lotus decoration on the roof. An image of Krishna is memorable. Unfortunately his flute was damaged.

On the journey to the next site we stopped to see the production of jaggery. This is a type of raw sugar made from sugar cane. The production method is fairly basic. The husk of the sugar cane is used to create furnaces which boil the sugar cane. This produces a thick yellow sugary mess. When this is cool it is pressed into moulds. It looks a bit like yellow honey, but its texture it is a solid when cold.

The next site was Srirangapatnam, a fort city. The Mysore Maharajas had a Muslim general called Hyder Ali. He took over Karnataka in C18. His son was Tipu Sultan. Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan were involved in four major battles with the British. They won the first two, lost the third and Tipu Sultan was killed in the fourth. Tipu's summer palace at Srirangapatnam, a monument celebrating the second victory. It is built of wood and some of the decorative paintings are currently being restored. The paintings on the walls show scenes of the battles.

It isn't described in any detail in the guidebook, but there is an old mosque in Srirangapathan. This was the mosque used by Tipu Sultan. He had his own special door, now plastered over. The mosque is in active use and has a small madrassa. From the mosque fragments of the fort are visible and we saw a few more fragments as we drove.

After the drive back to Mysore we visited the Devaraja market. The makers of the flower garlands were hard at work and there were a variety of different garlands on sale. In the vegetable section the various types of gourd were interesting as well as a wide variety of aubergines, most much smaller than the ones we buy.

For dinner we tried avegetarian restaurant close to the station. The north Indian thali was particularly good and very cheap. It wds served fast food style in small yellow plastic bowls.

Before leaving Eco Habitat we were given a tour of the farm. It was interesting to see the coffee beans. They also grow vanilla, herbs and vegetables. On the way to Mysore we stopped in the large Tibbetan refugee town to visit the golden temple. The temple has a large picture of the Dali Lama from his visit to the area last year. This is a new large built in the 1980s. Everything is new and shiny, related to, but not quite the same as the old monasteries in Nepal and Bhutan.

In Mysore we met our guide Mr Raghu. He likes a joke - crocodiles in the river! Our first visit was to palace place of the Maharajas. The family still live in part of the palace. They are wealthy, but they do not have political power and they no longer play any ceremonial role. The palace is more impressive on the inside, but photos are not allowed inside. The palace wapopulist from around 1905 to 1915. The decoration was by loartist twists. It is art deco style with iron pillars, lots of granite, stained glass windows and Minton tiles. It is like some of the art deco buildings in Glasgow, but on a bigger grander scale. There are touches which are distinctively Indian , particularly the peacocks in the decoration both in the stained glass and the tiles. Around the marriage hall which is the most spectacular room are pictures of the festival which takes place in October. The pictures show British soldiers parading around the palace, the Maharaja in his elephant howdah, and the crowds watching. The procession continues to take place today. An image of the goddess sits on the elephant howdah in place of the maharajah. From the gallery there was a view over the palace park. We could see the palace elephants in the distance and the palace cows. It was a surprise to see that the cows were died yellow. They are died with termeric for Pongal. They were a peculiar sight, spotted black and yellow.

The last visit was to the Chamudi hills area. We saw the temple at the top painted yellow because it belongs to the government from the outside. We stopped on the way down for a view over the city and to seethe huge black Nandi bull.

This morning was an early start for the safari. It was very misty to begin with as you can see on the photo. Slowly the mist began to clear. The was a good variety of bird life. This included jungle fowl on the ground, green parakeets, two different woodpeckers, a quick blue flash of a kingfisher and Indian roller bird with flashes of blue on its wings. These birds were just flying or hopping around as birdssod, but more interestingly we also saw an eagle which had just caught a small bird. It flew up into a tree with its prey. In a nearby tree there was a different kind of eagle. We saw lots of spotted deer, but none of the bigger sambar deer. Up in the trees there were jungle squirrels and langur monkeys. The early morning sun coming through the trees was highlighted the wide variety of trees. Our wildlife spotter was on the lookout for tigers. He heard something from the animal calls and took us back to the area where a small lake is visible in the distance. He spotted a tiger not far from the water. I caught a very brief glimpse with my binoculars, but it was a long way away and difficult to see. Much easier to see and more interesting to watch were the wild dogs. They were nearer and could be seen with the naked eye as well as through binoculars. Photographs were not possible because they were behind scrub. They had dark thick tails and reddish coats. The carcass of their deer kill was clearly visible and they were taking turns to eat. One of the pack was keeping watch for other predators.



We were hungry for our late breakfast and it was a late start for the drive to Coorg. Coorg is a coffee growing area. And it is also a tourist area popular with the workers from Bangalore. We first drove to the Eco lodge where we are staying. This isrun by a couple who have a small farm. The cottage had a large room and next door a small plunge swimming pool just about deep enough and big enough for one stroke. In the afternoon we made the short drive to The town in the area to. Visit the fort and a viewpoint called Raja's seat. We also stopped at a supermarket sellipopp local coffee and spices. This shop was jammed full with Indian tourists.

Our dinner was home cooked food from the farm, a vegetable curry, dhal and a chicken curry. Very good.

Today we are in a new state, Karnataka. The drive this morning inclused a very attractive countryside section. This was introduced by what looked like hay spread out over the Tarmac road. Our driver told us that this is lentils. The cars and the traffic drive over and this seems to be part of the threshing process. Very unusual. The cows seemed to be enjoying eating the lentil stalks. There was also a section of the road with an avenue of banyan trees forming an arch over the road.

The lodge where we are staying is a luxury place, unusual for this trip. We have our own veranda with a view of the lake. There are hammocks and even a free mini-bar! We chose to do the jeep safari early tomorrow afternoon which gave us time to enjoy the facilities here. The lake was quite low, but we walked over and on the way spotted a large black ibis on the grass. There were more birds on the lake so we walked along the lake shore. There was a large grey heron, the same as in the UK, but also a much smaller heron. There was also a very large
P1018527.JPG
egret, small cormorants and different kinds of small wading birds. In addition to the water birds there were terns and swifts. As we walked back to our cottage we heard monkeys above us in the trees. These were the common monkeys we have seen before, but their behaviour in the trees was much more interesting than their roadsidE behaviour. They were eating the leaves of the tree and breaking off small branches and eating those. While sitting outside on the verandah in the evening the insects were coming into their own including a moth drawn to the light.

There comes my second ROADTRIP .After my first successful #roadtrip to native, I was all excited for my next #roadtrip. Instantly planned a Day's #roadtrip on one of the 2 day weekend. Thanks to My co-rider Prashant for responding positively. We planned the trip on a short notice considering only 2 people, but eventually ended up having 7 more people joining us on the trip.So, we all were set for One Day #roadtrip to city of Fort, Chitradurga, 220 KMs from Bangalore. A brief history of Chitradurga follows,

Chitradurga gets its name from Chitrakaldurga (or Picturesque castle), an umbrella-shaped lofty hill found here. Chitradurga was also known by the names Chitradurg, Chitrakaladurga, Chittaldurg. Chittaldrug was the Official name used during the British rule. Chitradurga features bold rock hills and picturesque valleys, huge towering boulders in numerous shapes. It is known as the ""stone fortress"" (Kallina Kote). Timmana Nayaka, a chieftain under the Vijayanagar Empire, rose to the rank of governor of Chitradurga as a reward from the Vijayanagara ruler, for his excellence in military services,. This was the beginning of the rule of the Nayakas of Chitradurga. His son Obana Nayaka is known by the name Madakari Nayaka (1588 CE). Madakari Nayaka's son
DSC_0051
Kasturi Rangappa (1602) succeeded him and consolidated the kingdom to rule peacefully.
Legend of Onake Obavva



During the reign of Madakari Nayaka, the town of Chitradurga was besieged by the troops of Hyder Ali. A chance sighting of a woman entering the Chitradurga fort through an opening in the rocks led to a clever plan by Hyder Ali to send his soldiers through the hole. The guard on duty near that hole had gone home for lunch. The wife of that guard, Obavva was passing by the hole to collect water, when she noticed soldiers emerging out of this opening. Obavva was not perturbed. She was carrying with her an Onake (a long wooden club meant for pounding paddy grains). She killed Hyder Ali's soldiers one by one as they attempted to enter the fort through the opening and quietly moved the dead. Over a short period of time hundreds of soldiers entered and fell, without raising any suspicion. Obavva's husband, upon his return from his lunch was shocked to see Obavva standing with a blood stained Onake and hundreds of dead bodies of the enemy around her. Together both wife and husband beat up most of the soldiers. But
DSC_0079
as both of them were about to finish off all the soldiers of Hyder Ali, Obavva dies. The opening in the rocks still remains as a historical witness for the story, beside The Tanniru doni the well which Obavva was making her way to, when she found the soldieres of Hyder Ali. Though her brave attempt saved the fort on that occasion, Madakari Nayaka could not repel Hyder Ali's attack in 1779. In the ensuing battle, the fort of Chitradurga was lost to Hyder Ali. Obavva, like Kittur Rani Chennamma remains a legend, especially to the women of Karnataka.

Chitradurga Fort

Chitradurga Fort was built between the 10th and 18th centuries by the kings of various dynasties during that period which are Rashtrakutas, Chalukyas, Hoysalas and Nayakas of Chitradurga. After Nayakas lost it to Hyder Ali in the year 1779, the fort was given its finishing touches by Hyder Ali along with his son Tipu Sultan. It comprises a series of seven enclosure walls in Kannada. On the upper part of the fort Eighteen ancient temples can be found and in the lower part of the fort there is one huge temple. Among these temples the oldest and most interesting is the Hidimbeshwara
DSC_0082
temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s rule. The fort's many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest rainwater, and the fort was said to never suffer from a water shortage. This seemingly impregnable fort has 19 gateways, 38 posterior entrances, a palace, a mosque, granaries, oil pits, four secret entrances and water tanks.
Chandravalli caves



Chandravalli caves is located amidst three hills namely Chitradurga, Cholagudda and Kirubanakallu. These caves are a never-ending maze of steep steps that lead into passageways, rooms and ante-rooms where kings from the Kadamaba, Satavahana and Hoysala dynasties resided. And saints of the Ankali Math of Belgaum meditated in the temples. These caves are well ventilated but there is no light as its pitch dark inside the secret rooms that's why the kings used these rooms in case there was a threat of an intrusion.




Trip Experience

Trip was planned on a winter Sunday. Anticipating high temperature by mid of the day in Chitradurga, we planned to start early from Bangalore so that we can reach the location early and start exploring the fort before Sun is up right on our head. So, the platform was set
DSC_0083
on previous day. All planned to meet on the city outskirts at 5.30 AM on 17th Jan 2016.

Started from home at around 4.30 AM and reached our meeting point at around 5.30 AM after picking up my pillion-rider Sachin. after a small break and intro with all other co-riders we started right at 5.45 from Yeshwantpur first toll gate. Small break helped all of us to know better as few of us met for the first time. So, our entourage include Prashant, Laxmikant,Sachin,John, Aijaz, Vikram , Vivek and me. Manu joined us in Chitradurga (as he was on a personal break).

We started the journey with a mindset of driving at 70-80 km/hour and stuck to the plan for first half hour of drive before our first break in Tumkur. Cold soothing breezes kept us awake all through the drive to Tumkur, though the fog was not as expected. There comes, our first stop after riding almost 60kms. So, after a short break our real thrilling journey began, which reminded us we are on NH4.



NH4, is one of the best highways I have come across till now. As we hit NH4, we were
DSC_0084
mesmerized by the beauty of it. Our accelerator was asking for more and more. All of us on our respective mean machine Royal Enfield (5 of it) started accelerating to respond to the beauty of road and the road looked more and more beautiful as we accelerated and travelled distance. At one point our speedometer read 120... oopss... yes, all of us were driving at 110-120km/hr. In between we took a short break to rest our engine and started again towards our journey. After almost half hour from the break we reached our destination. Chitradurga, The City of Fort. It took us 2.5 hours to cover 220kms with breaks. So after a quick stop for breakfast our bike turned towards Stone Fort of Chitradurga.



So the journey begins to explore Stone Fort of Chitradurga. CHITRADURGADA KALLINA KOTE....

Entrance and the view of Fort from entrance itself describes the history of the Fort. Though the Fort was built some centuries ago, we could still feel the beauty of it. Excited to explore the Fort, we hired one of the Guide on location who took us around the Fort . He not only explained us about the history
DSC_0089
but also explained about the architecture of the Fort which was built not just scientifically but also strategically. Fort has all sorts of Art scripted on it's wall in abundance from which it derives it's name CHITRADURGA (Fort of Art).

Chitradurga is formed of two words in the Kannada language: ‘chitra’ means “picture” and ‘durga’ means “fort” and is tagged with the English word ‘fort’ to form the name “Chitradurga Fort”. It is also locally known as “Kallina Kote” or Stone Fortress, which is also formed of two Kannada words ‘Kallina’: “Stone” and Kote:“Fort”. Other names used in Kannada are ‘Ukkina Kote”: “Steel Fort” (metaphorically used to mean an impregnable fort) and ‘Yelusuttina Kote’: “Seven Circles Fort”

The fort is built in a series of seven concentric fortification walls with various passages, a citadel, masjid, warehouses for grains and oil, water reservoirs and ancient temples. There are 18 temples in the upper fort and one huge temple in the lower fort. Among these temples the oldest and most interesting is the Hidimbeshwara temple. The masjid was an addition during Hyder Ali’s rule.The fort's many interconnecting tanks were used to harvest rainwater, and the fort was said to never suffer from
DSC_0092
a water.

Chitradurga Fort lies in the midst of a valley formed by the Vedavati River. The Tungabhadra River flows to the northwest of the fort. Seven hills constitute the Chinmuladri range. The seven circles of the fort enclose these hills. Features of massive rock hills and scenic valleys, huge towering boulders are seen in the fort precincts. The hills on which major part of the fort and the city rest belong to the oldest rock of granitic formation in the country. The highest hill peak of the area is located at Jogi Matti, 5 kilometres (3.1 mi) to the south of Chitradurga.The highest elevation of the hills at the fort is 976 metres (3,202 ft).The area covered by the fort is reported to be 1,500 acres (607.0 ha)





Well that's about history and Architecture of Fort. Getting back to our experience now. We were led by our guide through the entire Fort. His explanation about Fort combined with it's history and architecture not just took us back to centuries of Chitradurga Ruling by Madakari Nayaka but also gave us a feeling of Kannada Movie ""NAGARAHAVU"", where Legend Actor Vishnuvardhana takes school kids to fort
DSC_0093
and explains them the history which is shown as a running story concurrently in the song. All the walls, Mahadwaras, Arts on walls, Places of meeting, oil reservoir,water saving containers and all other necessary amenities and structures though not intact but are in better condition , which are good enough and self explain about themselves. Each and every step under hot sun though made us exhausted, but the eagerness and enthusiasm to explore more and more of Fort kept us going. Between all these we meet the KOTI RAMA. Well known Rock Climber, though we missed his tricks of Rock climbing , it was a great experience to meet such a versatile personality. So, after exploring most part of the Fort we reached the most sought after place OBAVVANA KINDI, origin of bravery of one of the brave women of Karnataka History. After exploring the same, we headed to Hawamahal followed by a Big Rock to climb from where one can view the entire city of Chitradurga, Fort and which is a witness of all the movies shot in the city. By now half of us were exhausted due to excess heat, which means only remaining half of us ventured
DSC_0094
to explore the big climbing rock after a short visit to a nearby temple. Return of our adventurous crew from Rock climbing meant end of our visit to Fort, in between our guide said good bye after finishing his job. Kudos to our guide for helping us to explore the Fort better. So, before stepping out of Fort it was time for a brief photo session with our faces down due to exhaust.Finally we are out of THE GREAT STONE FORT OF CHITRADURGA. History still stands tall and will stand tall forever. Just outside the Fort is a Museum, which houses old artifacts and the great Onake of Obavva, which is a proof of her bravery.



Tired and hungry Royal Riders,were in bad need of a good place to relax and fill stomach, and finally we found a better restaurant to fulfill our hunger and thirst.So, after a heavy lunch and few chilled bear and soft drinks we headed to our next stop, which was a good 5 kms from the city THE CHANDRAVALLI CAVES.




Chandravalli Cave is another ancient architecture marvel. Amazingly carved cave which makes you bend and go around zig-zag
DSC_0095
way and which gives your body a natural massage. Caves are built very scientifically. The passage inside the caves are narrow and slim but good enough for human being to walk and stay. It's like a Gurukul underground. At one point of time we reached a place where it's all dark and we cannot see each other once all the lights are off and sound doesn't travel out of the room. It is said that , all critical strategic discussion were carried out at that place by the administration in consultation with Kulguru. Architecture of cave is such that, even at a depth of 80 feet down one doesn't feel suffocated. Exploring the caves is one of the best experiences that we had in our lifetime. So, with that there comes an end to our motto of exploring the beauty in City of Chitradurga. Which means, we started back to our destination.



After a small break, Royal Riders started back to city of work. With the Sun downing for the day our experience of exploring the beautiful history became a memory and with every passing light of Sun, though there was sadness of leaving such a wonderful
DSC_0096
experience behind, there was a happiness too for witnessing such a wonderful historical monuments, which made all our exhaust fade away.So , as the Sun came down, our speedometers too came down to 80kms/hr due to heavy traffic and eye catching headlights of opposing vehicles. After couple of breaks and photo shoots we entered our city of dreams, rather city of our bread & butter. Here comes Bangalore. So overall the meter read 500 kms for the day.



There comes the end of one of the best day of our life, which fades into our memory and rings in our ears as ...Chitradurgada Kallina Kote.... Sidiligu Baggada Ukkina Kote.....

Depuis quelques semaines les routes goudronnees et renovees fleurissent dans le quartier technologique. A savoir que la plupart des routes sont en terre et remplies de nids de poule. Vous ajoutez ca au fait qu'elles ne sont pas tres larges car ils sont depasses par le succes du parc technologique, et aussi l'instinct de l'indien qui essaye de gruger tout le monde et ca devient vite un bordel monstrueux. En plus il y a tres peu de feux alors ce sont les flics qui prennent le relais. Sauf qu'ils foutent plus le bordel qu'autre chose et puis personne ne les ecoutent vraiment a commencer par notre propre chauffeur.



Il y a une blague qui circulait sur internet il y a quelque temps : A la fin de Interstellar, la fille du hero, vieille dans son lit d'hopital, demande a son pere ou il etait tout ce temps. Son pere repond dans les embouteillage de Whitefield. Whitefield etant le quartier technologique ou l'on travaille. Cela represente parfaitement la realite des choses.

Notre premier jour a Dreamworks, ca nous a pris 1h30 pour rentrer a l'hotel seulement a 11 km de la. Les HR se sont limite excuses en disant que c'etait pas comme ca d'habitude, histoire de nous rassurer. C'est pas toujours autant que ca, mais c'est un bordel bien au dessus de la moyenne en general.



Bref, parfois on realise que du jour au lendemain ils ont rénovés toute une portion de route. Et souvent la portion est assez longue. Avec Aude on etait assez surpris de l'efficacite des indiens. Et bien non. Ce serait sans compter sur la corruption qui ronge tout le pays. Pour faire simple, les politiques font refaire les route pour justifier d'impots plus importants et s'acheter une villa privee ou autre. Jusque la ca va, c'est partout pareil. Sauf que si la route est trop bien faite et bien t'es vire. Un fois, une compagnie avait fait une route de bonne qualite. Elle n'a plus jamais eu de contrat avec le gouvernement ni personne d'autre. Elle a juste ete blackliste. Ce qui fait que 3 mois plus tard, a la moindre pluie ou degat des eaux, la plupart des routes se font emporter.

Voila un bon exemple de corruption en Inde.



Elle n'est generalement pas dans l'interet publique. Certains en arrivent meme a dire heureusement que le pays est corrompu, car cela permet de se sortir de situation impossible. Un pot de vin est le probleme est regle.

La derniere fois, un ami un indien nous a dit que beaucoup d'indiens avaient leur permis de conduire sans forcement le meriter. Certains manquent meme d'ecraser quelq'un a tous les coints de rue ou rentrer dans un poteau, et ce durant l'examen lui meme. Ils obtiennent tout de meme leur permis simplement parce que ce sont les auto ecoles qui payent directement les inspecteurs. Ca explique pas mal de choses quand au mode de conduite des indiens. Ca me rassure presque finalement.



L'ensemble du pays et fait comme ca, c'est un peu bancal syur plein d'aspect. La corruption est telle que chaque personne essaye va essayer de baiser une autre d'un amiere ou d'une autre et quelque soit la situation. Il faut etre tout le temps sur ses gardes.

La premiere fois qu'on a achete des bananes au supermarche, genre meme pas une semaine apres notre arrivee, la personne qui pesait nos bananes a taper un code d'un produit different et beaucoup plus cher afin de multiplier le prix par 10. On a ete vigilents et lui a signale que c'etait pas le bon pris. Je veux bien qu'on se trompe mais de la a confondre des bananes et des radis.... Surtout quand general, la personne te regarde avec un grand sourir qui veut dire pardon j'ai pas fait expres mais sont regard lui veut dire clairement j'ai failli te niquer.



La fois on on a acheter notre four et aspirateur (celui la meme qui n'avait pas la bonne prise), le prix total etait de 20000 roupies et des poussieres. Et j'avais droit a 1500 de rabais car au dessus des 20000 roupies. Arrive a la caisse il on simplement reduit l'adition de quelques roupies afin que je passe en dessous des 20k et perdre le rabais de 1500. Encore une fois j'ai pris un malin plaisir a leur mettre le nez dedans.

- ""Comment vous etes arrives a se resultat ?""

-""Et bien ca + ca""

-""Ok mon telephone me donne 20K vous voyez. Vous me devez 1500 de rabais""

Et puis les deux vendeuses se marrent entre elles et te regardent avec le meme air, genre pardon mais on voulait vraiment te niquer.



C'etait pourtant dans des magasins assez etablis, dans des centres commerciaux et qui ciblent pas la tranche social la plus pauvre. Le magasin d'a cote c'est Yamaha et Apple quoi. Et ben faut pas se filler aux apparences. Ou que tu ailles il faut faire attention, donc maintenant on est sur nos gardent. Et c'est a se demander quel interet ils ont a faire ca. Comme si ils etaient payes al commition. Je vais me renseigner a ce sujet car dans le supermarche, quand tu fais tes courses de bouffe, tous les 2 metres y a un vendeur pour te harceler. T'as le malheur de regarder un produit, chose que j'ai encore du mal a eviter quand je fais mes courses, autant pour moi. Tu peux etre sur que le vendeur le plus proche va te roder, probablement le mec a quelque centimetres de toi qui respire dans ton oreille. Et la c'est partie :

- ""Ca pas cher, ca meilleur qualite, ca crevette grosse, ca crevette moyenne, ca crevette petite, ca crevette curry,.....""

Et si tu regarde un autre produit il va enchainer sur ce produit.

Generalement Aude les envoie chier et moi je dis non une fois et apres je les ignore. Chacun son mode de reponse quoi. On commence a s'y faire mais au debut tu te sens vraiment agresse et mal a l'aise. Au debut on osait meme pas acheter quoique ce soit dans le magasin. On s'y sentait vraiment pas bien.

Parfois c'est vraiment utile et t'es content de recevoir un renseignement, mais la plupart du temps tu te sens juste observe.



Donc voila on est souvent sur nos gardes quand meme.

Ca plus le fait que quand ta carte bancaire passe pas ou que la connection au serveur n'a pas fonctionnee, et ben tu ne recois pas ton fameux ticket d'annulation et quand tu reesayes de payer tu te demande si tu va payer 2 fois ou pas. Mais au final on a jamais eu de mauvaise surprise. C'est juste un peu surprenant au debut. En general 30 seonde apres une transaction ta banque t'envoie un mail et un sms pour resummer la transaction. C'est pratique meme si ca rempli rapidement ta messagerie. Et finalement la seule fois ou on a paye deux fois pour la meme transaction, c'etait a Decathlon. Comme quoi les prejuges....



Le week end prochain on va visiter les ruines de Hampi sur 3 jours donc on aura surement des super souvenirs a partager.



Bonne annee et a la prochaine !

January 5th 2016
Published: January 5th 2016


Bijapur, North Karnataka
Gol Gombuz
Christmas Holidays are probably the best time to travel for Bangaloreans. IT and related software companies which are the nerve-centre of Bangalore remain in comparatively leisurely mood.

This year (2015) Christmas was on Friday resulting in continuous three holidays. Unbearable traffic in ever-busy Bangalore Roads was not visible. Most residents either went to their native places or decided to break out of Bangalore. Above all Bangalore weather was excellent. I could not resist taking a long drive out of Bangalore, this time to the heritage sites of North Karnataka.

Karnataka boasts one of the finest architectural creations in India (if not the world) and a very rich cultural heritage, most of which is located in North Karnataka. I planned to visit the following places to fully utilise my holidays spanning three days :

1. BIJAPUR - Bijapur city is well known for its historical monuments of architectural importance built by the Muslim rulers during Sixteenth century AD. It is located around 530 Kms from Bangalore.

2. AIHOLE – Temples Famous for Chalukyan Architecture from Fifth to Eigthth Century AD. Located around 130 Kms from Bijapur.

3. PATTADAKAL – Magnificent temple sculptures of Seventh & Eighth Century
Bijapur, North Karnataka
Imbrahim Rouza Tomb
AD, declared as World heritage Site by UNESCO. Around 13 Kms from Aihole.

4. BADAMI – Cave temples carved out of caves during Sixth to Eighth Century AD by Badami Chalukyas. Further around 22 Kms.

I skipped Hampi due to paucity of time and also since I visited the place earlier.

My travel plan was as follows :

1. First day- to reach BIJAPUR and stay there.

2. Second day- start with visiting sites in BIJAPUR and then gradually travel to AIHOLE, PATTADAKAL depending on availability of time

3. Third & Final day- to visit tourist spots in BADAMI and coming back to Bangalore.

My immediate requirement was to look for a lodging arrangement at Bijapur. To my misfortune, despite continuous efforts for hours (initially thru net-booking and when that failed, thru calling over phone to no of various hotels (collected from sulekha.com)), I could not manage confirmation from any of the hotels. That did not deter me, I decided to go ahead with my plan.

25.12.2015

Bangalore-Neelamangala-Tumkur-Hariyur-Chitradurga- Hospet- Bijapur

(NH4 & NH 13)- Distance around 530 Kms

Thought of starting early morning (around 5 O’clock) but delayed to
Bijapur North Karnataka
Imbrahim Rouza Tomb 2
around 6.15 AM due to making all necessary arrangements. Previous night, I completed my essential pre-requisites i.e. filling up the fuel tank (35Ltrs required) of my car from the nearby Shell Petrol Pump, checked Air-pressure of wheels. Google Maps would be my guide for selecting the route.

Weather was cool but not chilly. City was slowly waking up with early morning laziness. Traffic was comparatively less, but only upto Yeshwantpur. From there, after driving for more than half an hour at snail’s speed, when I finally touched upon the lengthy flyover near Peenya, it was already around 7.15 AM.

There were two Toll Gates in the outskirts of Bangalore (Rs. 20/+Rs 17/-), out of which one was just after Neelamangala. I was amazed to see hundreds of vehicles waiting to cross the toll gates. There were seven-eight queues each consisting at least hundred vehicles. Many of them were cars with families and friends going out of Bangalore.

In my queue I noticed that the toll challan was issued by a person standing after the toll gate. While counting the change he returned one rupee less. When pointed out he returned one rupee separately. A convenient way to
Bijapur
Jamma Masjid
earn huge un-accounted income by the toll-gate personnel for each of so many waiting cars, since there was hardly any time to count the change returned.

Immediately after leaving Bangalore ,the weather became foggy and visibility level dropped. The traffic was considerably lesser. NH4 was a six lane highway and the entire road was beautifully maintained. At 8.30 AM I reached TUMKUR (75 Kms) and soon after crossed the next Toll plaza (Rs. 70). Thereafter it was a pleasant drive. I kept my accelerator pressed, and drove between 120 and 150 Km/hr and reached the fourth Toll Plaza (Rs. 55) at around 9.45 AM (187 Km) (near Hariyur).

I was not ready for what I was about to see next. Two young Motor Cycle riders were lying on the road in a pool of blood, with their two-wheelers by the road-side in badly damaged condition. From the look of it, they appeared to be from Bangalore, having possibly embarked on a joy ride. Both were badly wounded. Some two-wheelers stopped and tried to call for Ambulance/ Medical assistance, which was not forthcoming.

This incident helped me regain my sense of safety and need to drive carefully. I
Bijapur
Entrance Jumma Masjid
decided to monitor my speed (preferably not beyond 110 km/hr) and thereafter maintained the same throughout my journey.

Before Chitradurga I switched on my “Google Map”. Reached Chitradurga at around 10.15 AM (200 Kms). Taking right turn to reach NH 13 was slightly difficult since I could not properly gauge the map direction initially but corrected myself thereafter.

Since I would be driving alone, I was carrying plenty of snacks and fruits. I did not stop for breakfast (except a sip of tea in one of the toll gates). I decided to have a dry-lunch with my snacks and fruits only. This worked well as I managed to avoid a siesta which would be risky in a long drive.

After taking a brief rest the journey began in NH 13. Unlike NH4, it was a two lane Highway upto Hospet (around 130 Km from Chitradurga) with reasonable traffic (mostly trucks, large car hauling vehicles). The journey had been slightly painstaking, particularly in view of the recurrent trouble of overtaking large vehicles in a comparatively narrow road. Moreover, there were sudden speed breakers, mostly without any road sign.

On the way I came across a big market
Aihole, North Karnataka
Durga Temple
on the road side (around 80 Kms from Chitradurga) exclusively trading of sheeps and goats. Large no. of people, bullock carts as well as two wheelers were parked nearby. People were carrying animals in their vehicles after trading. It was a country market which was different, particularly for urban folk like me.

I also stopped near a Sunflower cultivation field on the roadside. Watching thousands of Sunflowers glowing in the sun-shine served as a welcome break to the monotony of a long drive.

At around 1.15 PM I reached Tunga Bhadra Dam (330 Km). The place was unique and worth spending time in. The periphery of the dam (on the left side) was so huge that the other end was not visible. The right side was surrounded by hills with railway tracks on the top. I noticed a goods train moving slowly on the top. Thereafter NH 13 became broad and after around a kilometre entered a tunnel. Hospet town came after few kilometres crossing the tunnel.

Immediately after Hospet, there were two Toll gates (360 Kms) one after another (Rs. 35/- and Rs. 45/- respectively). My destination, Bijapur was around 170 Kms from here.

After
Aihole
Durga Temple
Hospet, NH 13 (now a six lane high way) was a pleasure to drive.

Crossing three more toll plazas (Rs 45+Rs.50+Rs.70),I reached Bijapur (530 Km) at around 4.30 PM. The fuel indicator was nearing the danger mark, hence the immediate need was to feed the car. I did the same by filling 10 Ltrs of petrol from a small-sized petrol bunk inside of Bijapur town.

A brief history of Bijapur:

Bijapur city came under the Muslim influence since the time of Allauddin Khilji of Delhi in the late 13th century.

In 1347, the area was conquered by the Bahmani Sultanate of Gulbarga. In 1518, the Bahmani Sultanate split into five states known as the Deccan sultanates, one of which was Bijapur, ruled by the kings of the Adil Shahi dynasty for nearly two hundred years (1490–1686). City’s famous architectural marvels were built during the rule of this dynasty.

Although generally rivals, the five split states of erstwhile Bahumani Sultanete allied together against the Vijayanagara Empire of Hampi, the last and only famed Hindu dynasty of South India in 1565. The battle of Talkota was won by the Muslim forces , permanently weakening Vijayanagar Kingdom and finally culminated in its end
Aihole
Wall Sculpture Durga - Durga Temple
after a few years.

But it resulted in further strengthening Adil Shah Dynasty. During the rule of Mohammad Adil Shah (1627-1657) the boundary of Bijapur state extended as far as Bangalore.

The Sultanate was damaged by the revolt of Shivaji, whose father was Maratha commander of Adil Shah regiment.

The rule of Adil Shah dynasty ended in 1686, when Bijapur was conquered during the reign of Mughal emperor Aurangzeb.Although the Mughals destroyed the Adilshahi, it was Shivaji's revolt which weakened the Adilshahi control.

Coming back to the present :

I tried to look for a lodging near the bus stand. I approached “Hotel Lalit Mahal” adjacent to the bus-stop and luckily got accommodation.

The hotel mainly caters to the long-distance bus passengers who need overnight halt in a boarding place near the bus stand. The tariff was quite reasonable (Rs 750/- per night for a double bed room, far less than other well-known hotels shown in various web-sites). The rooms were ok for a night’s halt. Futhermore, it had parking facility. It fulfilled all my basic requirements.

Despite having great historical significance and being the centre of humongous and beautiful Muslim Architecture, the present
Aihole
Wall sculpture of Durga - Durga Temple
Bijapur looked dirty compared to other Karnataka Tourist places, as if time stood still there. There seems to be less publicity also compared to other tourist spots.

I had dinner at “Kamat Hotel”. Despite its brand name, the quality of food was not upto the mark.

26.12.2015

After taking breakfast I checked out from the hotel. My program was to visit the important tourist places in Bijapur first and then proceed for the next destination.

My morning visit commenced with “Barah Kaman” then to “Jami Masjid” located nearby. The Barah Kaman was in ruins and did not look to be impressive, wheras the “Jami Masjid” was a must see.

JAMI MASJID

It is the largest and oldest mosque in South India. Ali Adil Shah I, after his triumphant victory over Vijayanagara built this mosque. This wonderful place of worship is a brilliant piece of architecture and a must visit in Bijapur.

GOL GOMBUZ

It is the largest dome ever built in India and second largest in the world, next in size only to St Peter's Basilica in Rome. It is the tomb of Mohammed Adil Shah (ruled 1627-1657) and construction ended in 1656.Adil
Aihole
Love eternal - Durga Temple
Shah was buried in the vast vault, beneath the floor of the hall.

I was surprised to note the respect and love given by the king to his mistress (Ramba) who lied on the one side of the king’s tomb along with his wives. Definitely he had a great heart.

The tomb is an example of architectural glory with its magnificent large 'whispering gallery'. Gol Gumbaz is a fine piece of Islamic architectural style.

The tomb was located near the Railway station and opens at early morning.

The archaeological museum was located inside the compound and worth visiting. The paintings of the Battle of Talkota (fought with Vijayanagara Kingdom) were exhibited in the Archaeological Museum, Bijapur. One picture showing beheading the defeated Vilayanagar King was striking.

TOMB OF IBRAHIM ROUZA

Built in 1627 it comprises two magnificent buildings, one is the Mosque and a Tomb. It contains the tomb of Ibrahim Adil Shah II and his queen Taj Sultana. It was originally intended to be the tomb for the queen.

One important feature was that the design of Taj Mahal was inspired by this tomb. The look of the structure has similarity to
Aihole
Narasimha Avatar - Durga Temple
the Taj Mahal, although the Taj Mahal was constructed by Marble rocks..

This is one of the most beautiful monuments I have seen anywhere.

In both the places I took the help of Guides to understand the importance of these structures. Entry fee in both the places were Rs. 5/- + Rs 25/- for Camera + Rs 150/- Local Guide.

Interestingly I saw hundreds of school children visiting these places (even places of my subsequent visits i.e. Aihole, Pattadakal, Badami) along with their teachers. Probably the visits were educational tours arranged by schools in various parts of Karnataka and commendable.

City has many other historical monuments, many of them are in ruins.

I started my visit at around 7.30 AM in the morning and when I completed the visit of “Ibrahim Rouza”, it was already 11.30 AM. I decided to proceed to my next destination, AIHOLE.

AIHOLE

Visiting Aihole from Bijapur was like going back another millenium or so i.e. from 16th Century, back to 6th Century AD. Aihole is around 130 Kms from Bijapur. Initially I drove around 100 Kms thru NH 13 and in between crossed two Toll Plazas (Rs. 50-+Rs
Pattadakal, North Karnataka
Sanghameshwara Temple
80). After the second Toll Plaza passing a bridge near Almatti Dam I took right turn to drive thru SH 133.

While the drive thru NH 13 was excellent, the state Highway 133 was narrow and not well maintained. The area was near the Almatti Dam and rich in cultivation. I was coming thru interior villages as well as cultivated fields in both sides of the road. Without “Google Map” direction, it was impossible for me to locate my destination.

At around 1.30 PM I could reach AIHOLE. On the way I filled in 10 more Litres of petrol.

Brief history

Aihole was located around 500 Kms from Bangalore. It is said Parashurama washed his axe in Aihole after killing the Kshatriyas.

It has immense historical significance and is called the 'cradle of Hindu rock architecture’. The temples were famous for Chalukyan architecture dating back to a long period from fifth to 12th Century. There are many temples in this place.

Durga Temple

Most incredible was the Durga temple constructed around 8th Century AD. The temple was enriched with beautifully carved walls and pillars having various sculptures with minute details. The wall carving
Pattadakal
Virupakhsha Temple
of “Mahisa Sura Mardini Durga” was magnificent. The wall statue of Durga was almost identical to Goddess Durga worshipped in Bengal which was an integral part by Bengali culture. How it related to our Durga idol and reached distant Bengal was amazing. Other wall statutes of the temple were also simply outstanding.

Lad Khan Temple

The temple was built by the Chalukya Kings in the 5th century. The walls of the temples had beautifully carved stone sculptures. Ironically the temple was named after a Muslim warlord living here.

PATTADAKAL

Pattadakal was very near (around 13 Kms) from Aihole. I started for Pattadakal after around one hour stoppage in Aihole.

Initial drive was thru a narrow and badly maintained road (around a Kilometer) inside a village. Gradually the road condition was improved to some extent but still filled up with large no of patholes. Driving had to be slow and cautious. Surroundings changed after some time and there were long hills in the surroundings. One important feature was the colour of the hill stone, mostly pinkish. There was definitely a link between the nature of this stone and rich architectural environment in this place.

At
Pattadakal
Sanghameshawara temple 2
around 3.15 PM I reached Pattadakal.

Brief History :

Located near Malaprabha river, Pattadakal is one of the world heritage sites declared by UNESCO.Itwas the capital of the Chalukya dynasty between the 6th and 8th centuries. The Chalukyas built many temples here between the 7th and 8th century. Pattadakal is a great centre of Chalukya art and architecture, noted for its temples and inscriptions. It is called ‘the Laboratory of Indian Temples’. One can find both North Indian and Dravida Style of South Indian Temple side by side.

One advantage was that all important temples were located within one area.

Virupaksha Temple

Built in eighth century, the temple was the largest of all temples in Pattadakal. I am not a student of architecture, but I must say that the brilliant sculptures of Nataraja and other goddess in the temple wall were enough to mesmerise even an ordinary person with no background in this field. Kudos to those talented craftsmen who made those outstanding creations with stone that stood the test of time.

The sanctum contains “Black Siva Linga” as well as a “beautiful stone large bull.”

Sangameshvara Temple

This temple built in
Pattadakal
Nandi statute - Virupaksha Temple
Dravidian Style by Chalukya King during 7th Century AD was the oldest amongst all temples here.

There were large no. of visitors in all those places enjoying Christmas Holidays, many of them were school children.

It was 5.30 PM and I started for my last destination Badami.

BADAMI

Badami was around 22 Kms from Pattadakal. Road condition was not good once again. On the way I saw the Pink Stone of the roadside hills becoming reddish with the evening sunlight, a beautiful view to watch.

Once again, I had no prior booking of accommodation. After trying a few hotels in vein, I was suggested by one of the hotel personnel to try at Hotel Mukumbika. I got accommodated (Rs 1450/- for Double Room, Single Occupancy). I was allotted a room at the Ground Floor Corner, since all other rooms were reported to be already booked/occupied. Room was clean although not matching with the tariff. Ok, I had no other choice. The hotel was having a separate parking lot where I parked my car.

There was no restaurant in the Hotel. Hence I had to dine at night at an Udupi Hotel located just on
Pattadakal
Siva Linga - Virupakhsha Temple
the opposite. The quality of food was not satisfying.

After roaming various places throughout the day I was very tired. Thus it was time to go to bed and gain energy for the next day.

27.12.2015

A touch of History of Badami

Badami was capital of “Badami Chalukyas” during Sixth Century AD. This kingdom ruled Karnataka, few areas of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra during the period of Sixth to Eighth Century. The greatest ruler of this dynasty was Pulakeshin II.

In middle of the Sixth Century, the Pallavas (presently from Tamil Nadu) destroyed Badami (then named Vatapi). But the Chalukyas fought back and won the war against the Pallavas and their capital Kanchipuram. After the Rastrakuta dynasty came to power in Karnataka, Badami lost its importance.

The rivalry between two south Indian culture dated back to thousand years which was manifested in the conflict between Chalukyas and Pallavas.

I was advised by the Hotel personnel to visit the Badami Caves in early morning which I did. The place was very near to the hotel. Another advantage would be avoid huge Christmas Holiday rush.

Brief History of Badami Caves

There are
Aihole
Sun flower Blossom - On the way
four cave temples created side by side. The Cave Temples were sculpted mostly between 6th and 8th centuries. One had to climb to the caves thru around 100 footsteps. The panoramic view on top of the hill was beautiful. The hills of Badami Caves was on one side of a big lake. In fact the lake was surrounded by hills of pink colour stones. On the bank of the lake was the ancient Boothnath Temple.

Cave 1 was devoted to Lord “Shiva”. This was the oldest of the caves. What attracted me the most was the crafted sculpture of Lord Shiva with 18 arms depicting different dancing poses. Lord Ganesha was on the left side with dancing mood. The craft was one of the best and brilliance of the craftsmen was beyond elaboration.

Cave 2 & 3 was dedicated to Lord Vishnu. Several forms of Vishnu avatars are crafted in the caves. Lord Vishnu manifested in his various glorious form which were immortalised by the beautiful craftsmen thousand years ago.

Cave 4 depicted Mahavira and other scholars related to Jain Religion.

These four cave temples represent the secular nature of those rulers. “Intolerance”, “Secularism” are the buzzwords
BADAMI
Badami caves
and much discussed topic today. However depiction of the lords of various religions (Hinduism, Buddhism & Jainism) side by side together in Badami Caves was a glaring example of tolerance practised in India since thousand years.

Visiting all the caves took nearly two hours. I came back to main road and had small breakfast. There was a motorable road for going to the other side of the lake. But it was very narrow and stretched between dense habitats. I decided to visit there particularly to have glimpse of the ancient temples located therein.

There were no of ancient temples on that side. Out of that most noticeable was the Boothnath Temple. This temple of Lord Shiva was constructed right on the lake itself and excellent to watch.

Driving back to Bangalore

After having bath and checking out from the hotel I started my return journey at around 12 PM. Bangalore was around 450 Kms from Badami. The day temperature was hot but not un-bearable. During return journey also I decided to depend on Fruits and Snacks only to statisfy my belly with occasional stoppage in between.

Starting the journey thru NH 367. After around 50
BADAMI
Anantha Vishnu
Kms, Google Map advised me to adopt a shorter route. I followed the Google Map and landed into a narrow road. The road was full of Potholes and not at all motorable. After proceeding few kilometres there was a bit improvement. Suddenly the Google Map stopped its operation.

Thereafter I had to drive considerable distance in an under-construction road. I was deeply concerned with the safety of my car, which was not equipped to face this kind of road. Gradually the road stretched thru interior cultivation fields on all sides and few interior villages.

The fuel meter was indicating need for filling up petrol at the earliest.

Totalling loosing the way, I halted to the next village stop. Despite having language problem they were very helpful. As per the villagers advice I had to change the direction of my car and to drive further. At around 1.30 PM when I reached Beur to touch NH 13 I felt relieved.

One disadvantage of blindly following the Google Map was that the road condition had not been explicitly depicted or known. As such, there was a possibility to end up in an awkward situation which I experienced at
BADAMI
More images Badami Caves
the last leg of my journey.

I filled up 20 Ltrs of petrol from the nearby petrol Bunk and resumed my journey. Thereafter it was a smooth journey. I reached Hospet at around 2.10 PM and Chitradurga at 4.30 PM.

Ultimately I reached my home in Bangalore at around 9 PM. Over all I travelled around 1170 Kms in three days and consumed around 65 Ltrs of petrol.

Total approx cost of the trip (except cost of food, Entry Fees, Guide Charges):

1. 65 Ltrs of petrol – Rs. 4300/-

2. Toll Plaza Fees

i.Bangalore to Bijapur – Rs. 417

ii. Bijapur to Aihole – Rs. 130

iii. Badami to Bangalore – Rs. 242

Total Rs. 789

(I hope I did not miss any Toll Gate)

3. Lodging Charges –

Bijapur Rs 750

Badami Rs. 1450

Total Rs. 10790

Overall It was a pleasant journey.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Chikmagalur
January 2nd 2016
Published: January 2nd 2016

A Good Vibe leads to a Good Start!-Sneha Marappa

Chikmagaluru has always been on the top list of my favorite places with the best of the climate that you can ask for, mountains stretching all around, waterfalls that you can see after every few meters on the road, fog that hugs your body with the chill breeze where goose bumps too would feel good. I would never get bored to visit this place; my friend’s call it as my second home but I call it just as home. I have been going through lot of blogs since many years and this travel blogger Shivya Nath is one of my favorites who had written about how to start solo travelling where she stated to start a solo trip with a known place that you are comfortable with and there you go, I knew which place to start with.

Been wanting to share this post from really long time but there was something holding me back, may be my conscious somehow knew I would be visiting this place again and again. After my first solo trip in February to Chikmagaluru, I went for the second time in March with a friend
2
of mine and for the third and last time just for this year (hopefully) with another friend. So here it is presenting 3 phases of Chikmagaluru!

Phase 1!

I have been to Chikmagaluru twice earlier so have pretty much seen most of the places around. As this was my first solo trip, I just wanted to feel comfortable in one place and come out of my hidden fears. I have always been scared of dark and staying alone, I really had to come out of that fear. One of my friends referred me to stay in this place, Devigiri Homestay, which had everything like I wanted. As comfortable as I want to be and as adventurous as I can be.

Tree house that I stayed in where there is no electricity, solar lamp is used instead and is about few meters walk in the woods from the main area. It was luckily a full moon night; there was moon light peeping through those tall silver oak trees. I managed to walk all through gazing at the moon by telling thanks for shedding the light while I walked!

These pictures are from a short trek that I went
3
through the estate I stayed in, got to witness the spectacular sunset amidst the mountains bidding goodbye for the day.

On the last day of any trips that I have gone so far, I have always felt wish I could stay longer. But on the last day of this one, I was very happy, there was a smile around me that kept saying this is not the last day, it is a beginning of many other trips in future. I made a promise to myself that I would never stop travelling and it will always or mostly be alone.

Phase 2!

Just like I felt there are many more to come, right after a month; a friend of mine wanted to go to Chikmagaluru. As it was first time for her, we had to go see the places around.

Mullayanagiri is the highest peak in Karnataka; it also has few caves which can be peeped into. It was raining when we reached there; we started climbing the hill to witness the view of the whole town. Seethalayanagiri is another hill which is on the way to Mullayanagiri. Baba Budangiri also called as Datta Peeta is a
4
pilgrimage site, there is a waterfall here called Manikyadhara falls which is a sacred place for devotees who visit Datta Peeta.

Jerry Falls is about 20 minutes’ drive in the Jeep from the main road, due to bad roads cars or any other vehicles were not allowed.

To wrap the day, we stopped over a temple and had a very good view of Devigiri Hills for the sunset.

Phase 3!

This was totally a different experience, it was the first time I was seeing a different part of Chikmagalur. A friend of mine who accompanied me is a wild life and nature lover and so am I; so I decided this time to stay close to Bhadra Wild Life Sanctuary. We stayed in a place called Nature Light Home Stay in Mallandur, a small village which is about 20 Kms from Chikmagaluru which is surrounded by coffee plantations. Nature Light Home Stay has the best food and best hosts I have come across.

Trip to Chikmagaluru without a trek is never complete; Kavikal Matta is a view point which is about 8 Kms from the home stay, can also be reached by a Jeep but we of course
5
preferred to trek. There are no rough roads or stones that you could see while walking but all you can see is a green carpet on all the sides you turn around. On the way there are lots of private coffee estates which you can run into, a river which is flowing by, small roads where there is no tar instead all green, drizzles dripping on you, fresh air that is not polluted.

This was the time when all our 5 senses were completely awake, most adventurous jeep ride ever with only rocks on the road and wheels rolling over them. Holding our breaths tight in the ride, we moving all around like a tide! This place is called Bande Kallu(Bande is rock and Kallu is stone), not to be exaggerating, once you are on the rock all you can see is 360 degrees of mountains all around.

There was only peace all around, it was too difficult to leave this place but had to bid a good bye. With global warming on one side, such places give us some hope that there is some way we can still sustain our lives for few more years.

I
6
always believed in this line “It’s the Journey that matters and not the Destination”; this was so true with this journey; Journey to this waterfall called Jagara Falls was just more than incredible. The drive is completely through the dense Bhadra Forest which is about 10 km drive from Mallandur.

With the bumpy ride on the jeep, trees all around, anonymous river flowing, peacock’s which are my favorite bird which was all around on the roads; they are all just a feast to the eyes.

There was this huge tree with a tiny cave in it J

Jeep ride ends to a point where there is a river flowing, from the river it is about one and a half km trek through a private coffee plantation to reach the waterfall. Leeches chilling on your feet tasting your warm blood, holding to the roots of the trees to pass from one corner to other, sliding through the mud and we finally reach the destination to watch the beautiful waterfall. Like I mentioned earlier, Journey to this waterfall was more incredible than seeing the waterfall itself.

This boy took us all around and made us feel safe in
7
the bumpy ride!

There is a very famous place where a lot of regional movie shootings happen which was our last stop for the day, yet again with a beautiful view of mountains and paddy fields.



Green on the ground and green all around,

You made us swirl like a cloud.

All our senses had its feast,

You are a beauty and the beast.

Slice from heaven that came through rain,

You make us fall in love again & again!



Blooming...

Ah quoi de mieux pour commencer l’année qu'une coupure d'électricité justement !

Ça faisait un mois qu'on avait pas eu de coupure d'électricité. En fait depuis qu'on a quitte l’hôtel ! Un hôtel pourtant 5 étoiles, dans lequel on est reste 3 semaines le temps de trouver un appartement. Mais cinq étoiles ne veut pas dire que l'on échappe a 3 ou 4 coupures d'électricité par soir, ce qui rend les conversations skype ou meme le visionnage d'un film, un peu complique. Et quand par miracle l'électricité ne fait pas des siennes, c’était l'eau chaude qui posait problème, ou plutôt l'eau froide en l’occurrence.



Toujours est-il, depuis notre arrivée dans notre appartement il y a 1 mois, pas de coupure d'électricité, rien. On a bien eu un petit problème de chauffe-eau mais après tout, 1 semaine après il était réparé, et puis on avait toujours les 2 autres salles de bain pour moyen de secours (chacune ayant son propre chauffe-eau).

Et puis soudainement, hier soir, 31 décembre, on décide de se faire un petit repas tout simple, normal quoi. On prépare notre poulet et nos patates, on met en marche la machine a purifier l'eau et on allume même le système d'eau chaude pour faire une petite vaisselle, tout ce qu'il y a de plus banal. Puis 20 minutes plus tard, sans raison particulière, coupure de courant. Puis le courant se remet en marche, et coupure a nouveau. Comme ça 3 fois d’affilé jusqu’à ce que cette fois le courant ne revienne pas. On ouvre le disjoncteur, tout semble ok. On désactive et réactive au cas ou il y ait un truc bizarre, genre une surprise indienne. Après tout ils vendent bien des aspirateurs avec des prises plus grosses que celles dans les murs (oui oui, on a bien eu cette surprise). Bref, on réactive le bidule mais ça change rien. On allume nos bougies, on appelle 3 ou 4 numéros jusqu’à joindre l’électricien. Parfait l’électricien arrive dans quelques minutes.

On est assis dans le noir sur le canapé, comme des cons, a attendre que le mec vienne, la bouffe est froide et pas cuite, le linge est encore trempe dans la machine a laver (elle aussi arrêtée en plein milieu), et on se dit que la soirée s'annonce longue. On reste assis la dans le noir, pendant 1 bonne heure. L’électricien ne vient pas. D'habitude ils ne sont pas ponctuels mais la, personne a l'horizon. Et subitement, le courant revient. Sans raison aucune. Je saute de joie retourne a mes fourneaux et rebelote, coupure de courant. Aude rit jaune. Le courant revient, je débranche le four au cas ou. Suite a différents tests je me rend compte que le four n'aime pas la prise sur laquelle il est branche. Ça fait des semaines qu'il est branche la mais ce soir, je sais pas pourquoi cette prise le gonfle et il ca fait tout disjoncter, quelque part, dans un lieu inaccessible et inconnu.. Aujourd'hui c'est pas le cas, il est de retour sur sa prise, mais probablement que le 31 decembre c'est un jour qui lui rappelle des mauvais souvenirs. On n'a pas voulu le contrarie, alors on l'a change de prise juste pour cette fois la.



Finalement la soiree n'a pas ete si longue que ca !



Tout ca pour dire qu'en Inde, y a toujours un petit truc pour te rappeler a l'ordre. Que ce soit dans un hotel 5 etoiles, au centre commerciale (pratique pour conserver la chaine de froid), ou chez toi, tu es en Inde et la vie te le rappelle. Que ce soit l'electricite ou autre chose. Oublie ta routine car ca n'existe pas !



Mais bon c'est cool quand meme, a cote de ca y a des avantages. On sort du mois le plus froid (decembre) et on l'a passe en t-shirt. On va d'ailleurs probablement passer notre hiver a se baigner a la piscine.



Bisous et bonne annee !

December 29th 2015

Ibrahim Rouza
Bijapur
We had chosen to come to the region of Badami after our time in Hampi because we thought that on this off the beaten track destination we will not have to struggle with accomodation. How wrong we were. It took us ages to find accomodation here. Badami was fully booked. Both, Aihole and Pattadakal are little villages that do not offer accomodation. Finally we found a place in Bagalkot which is another hour away from Badami (even Bagalkot was nearly fully booked). OK, we were right: it is off the beaten track hence we did not meet westerners. But for indians, it seemed like all inhabitants from Bangalore, Pune, Mumbai, Chennai and Mysore together were on the move in this region including hordes of school classes.

The trip from Hampi to Bagalkot was pretty easy. We took a bus to Hospet, changed for a bus to Ilcal and then another local bus to Bagalkot. It took us 4 hours. We did not have a map of Bagalkot and not the slightest idea what this city was like. We just had the address of our guesthouse. It turned out that this guesthouse was in the suburbs of Bagalkot (a nice residential
on a horse-drawn carriage
area). We took a rickshaw and arrived there safely. And then the shock: we had booked in (and payed already - it was the only possibility to get a room) a shit hole! The rooms were really old, only superficially cleaned (surprisingly, the bedsheets and towels smelled and looked freshly washed) and the bathroom was filthy. The door did not even have a locker. We complaint because of the locker and got a different room which was slightly better. But there were spiderwebs hanging around the cupboards and on the walls - awful. OK, for this night, we had no other possibility - we had checked everything. If we wanted to see the temples of Aihole and Pattadakal again - we had no other possibility. OK, somehow we managed to calm our mind, just take it like it is for 2 nights.

After leaving our things in the guesthouse, we tried to find a place where we could relax over a cup of tea and later have dinner. We ended up in one of the best hotels in Bagalkot, the Shiva Shangam Hotel. It was not a cozy place, but enough to hang around a bit and have a
Nina among school girls
decent dinner. After a night in safe sleeping bags (we always carry our sleeping bags for beds like this), we got up really early and took the bus to Badami and further on to Aihole. The temple in this little village (oh yes, this area is the true rural part of Karnataka) is extremely beautiful. As we reached it quite early, the grounds were empty and peaceful. Visiting the impressive Durga Temple we agreed that it was worth staying in our filthy place to come here. Later we took a local bus back to Pattadakal. Pattadakal is known for its groups of temples which are collectively a World Heritage Site. The main Virupaksha Temple shows on its columns episodes from the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. Also these temples were amazing and really beautiful although in the meantime, the hordes of indians and school groups had arrived. But we took our time and enjoyed the scenery. To go back to Badami, we squeezed into a completely overloaded minibus which was speeding from one village to another for 1 hour before reaching Badami (the trip was accompanied by VERY loud music). It was fun and the locals on the bus seemed to
Durga Temple Aihole
see white people for the first time in their lifes. We felt like aliens....;-).

In Badami we made a little lunch break and went for a nice Thali to the Mayura Hotel before we took a horse-drawn carriage to reach the Badami Caves. The caves and the views from the caves were really beautiful. But it was so packed with people, we could hardly talk to each other because we could not understand our own words. The many school groups were incredably loud and all wanted to take pictures with us. It was fun but after a while, this is really making you tired and we just tried to escape the situation. Finally we took back the bus to Bagalkot and went to the hotel for dinner before it was back to the awful room for another short night.

The next morning we took the first bus at 6 am to Bijapur. It was again a 4 hour ride with a local bus. By reaching Bijapur we were shocked. We have never seen such a dirty city in our lives before. There was rubbish all around, it was very dusty and men and women alike were spitting wherever
bull race in the streets near Bagalkot
they were standing. But by reaching our next homestay we were very relieved. We stayed in the Sabala Heritage Home . We had a nice, clean and quiet room with a big bathroom with hot water and a balcony (with a view over the fields around Bijapur). OK, maybe the city was not our favourite one, the homestay was nice, people really friendly and the food was excellent. On the grounds of the homestay there was also a NGO. Local women who lost their husbands are given work by producing local handicrafts. The handicrafts are sold in different shops around India. It is a great project and it was very interesting to see the work.

One afternoon we went for a walk around Bijapur town. Our first impression was right: this town consists of dust and rubbish. One can see beautiful islamic architecture all around the city - but the buildings, mosques and houses just stand there and are left for decaying. No-one is interested in them, the locals do not even know the names of the buildings. Often, we have seen signs in front of a building saying that this is a historically protected building and underneath the sign there
Durga Temple Aihole
is a huge pile of garbage. We were really shocked. The next morning before sunrise we took a motorbike (renting the bike was cheaper than taking a rickshaw and it was a lot of fun) to visit the famous Golgumbaz. The Golgumbaz is a mausoleum dating back to 1659. The towers are capped by an enormous dome. It is said to be the largest dome in the world after St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. One can reach the dome of the Golgumbaz by climbing up steep, narrow stairs in one of the towers. Indeed, it was impressive! In the afternoon we visited the second famous sight of Bijapur, the Ibrahim Rouza. It is another really beautiful islamic monument. On our way back to town we visited some decaying mosques, the citadel and the central market. But soon we went back to our homestay. On our last day, we were just hanging around in our homestay. In the afternoon we left Bijapur by train to Solapur from where we had to change for a night bus. Some more chaotic travelling was ahead of us.

We had a difficult time with a lot of struggles in this Northern part of Karnataka
Durga Temple details
and we were really sick of travelling by local transports around this part of India. It is stressful, it is packed with people and all people are touching us, starring at us. No-one speaks english and we could not read signs on the buses. More than ones we were really lost. This does not make travelling any easier. We were hoping for some nicer areas to continue our travels. Anyway, the tempels and the 2 major sights in Bijapur were really impressive. For the first time we understood people who were really fed up with travelling in India........ It was taking out all our energy.....

How lucky we were that we got train tickets to go to Hampi before christmas. This was nearly impossible and I still have to thank this wonderful and patient travel agent in Agonda who booked us the tickets 2 weeks in advance. As it was a day train and only a 7,5 hours trip from Madgaon to Hampi, we did not care about a general class ticket. The journey was great and the landscape especially in the beginning around the Dandeli Wildlife Parc really beautiful. In Hubli a horde of army guys came onto the train. But they were very kind and respectful. The train was packed but the journey still pleasant. Arriving in Hospet we were immediately attacked by the rickshaw drivers who wanted to take us to Hampi. No thank you - the local bus is much cheaper, convenient and fast. Only 30 minutes later we were in Hampi.

Famous Hampi - how many travelblogs have we read from bloggers raving about this serene spot. About the special atmosphere in Hampi. Well, the first thing we noticed was: Hampi is packed with tourists. Mainly indian tourists. Well, it is high season, accomodation is hard to get and really
in a coracle over the river
expensive (especially considering what you get). We had booked 3 nights in a non AC simple room in Hampi Bazaar for 2.000 Rupees! Across the river, where we originally wanted to stay, everything was booked for the next 2 weeks. Cheaper digs were impossible to find (despite one wants to sleep in a shit hole). Wow - glorious Hampi. It did not start that glorious and peaceful for us. Later, we found poor travellers sleeping in restaurants for one night as they did not get a room. We were lucky though. But the cost of the rooms ruined our budget. Anyway, we stayed a fourth night at a different place. It was awful, but the only way to see all the sights.

After our bad start in Hampi we headed to a roof top restaurant to enjoy the sunset and the views. That was indeed relaxing and nice! For dinner we ended up in the Mango Tree Restaurant in Hampi Bazaar. It was very relaxed, friendly and had amazing food! So we came here every single night.

Next morning it was time to explore Hampi. As our room was directly on the path to the river, we woke
Hampi impressions
up at around 6 am when all the school groups and other people who slept in the temple (and that were hundreds of people) went down to the river for the morning routine. OK, we followed them (not for our morning routine ;-)), but simply to watch the happenings. Well, when we say morning routine - this includes everything! People were shitting in the bushes and in between the rocks. They were all taking a bath in the dirty river where big crocodiles are supposed to be. They were washing their clothes, cleaning their teaths and so on.... It was a big event and great fun to watch.

Later we had a relaxing breakfast in a decent rooftop restaurant. First we decided to get an idea of Hampi by foot. We started to walk up Hemakuta Hill from where one can get a nice view over Hampi Bazaar. Furth on we went to the Krishna Temple and as far as the Lakshmi Narashima Tempel. Back to Hampi for a late lunch and than it was time to hike up Matanga Hill, the best place to enjoy the beautiful sunsets here.

The next day before further roaming around Hampi
indian tourist with her son
we had an important task to do. Where will we go after Hampi. Later than the 26 of december there was no space left in Hampi for us. As we thought to travel to some remote areas we excpected to not face any problems in finding a place. BIG mistake! We wanted to stay in Badami for 2 nights - everything fully booked. A travel agent found us a room in Bagalkot and he was also able to book a long distance bus for us later on, as all train tickets for the next 2 weeks were completely sold out. No need to say, that the remaining tickets were not a bargain! We were a bit frustrated - where is the fun of travelling when you have to prebook everything? And it was really ruining our budget. But we had no other possibility. Later the day, it was Hampi time again. We rented some bicycles an drove to the ruins further away, like the famous Elephant Stables, the Lotus Mahal and the Vittala Temple with the stone chariot. It was fun and it was really beautiful and once away from the most famous temples it was a very peaceful atmosphere.
on the train to Hospet
And of course, we visited the Virupaksha Temple - the only temple that is still in use here. Lucky enough, we could join a wedding ceremony there! On our last day, we decided to cross the river to Virupapur. There is a totally different feeling on this side of the river. We were very sad that we could not stay here as we liked it much more. It was still busy and full of tourists but has a more rural feeling with nice views over rice terrasses and boulders. We had a relaxing time and lunch in the Secret River View Guesthouse with fantastatic vies over the river to the Virupaksha Temple. Later, we walked over the boulders into a little valley an further down the river to the next coracle crossing. This was wonderful! No crowds, just some climbers hanging around the boulders. The landscape was stunning! For the first time we realised why so many people rave about Hampi. When we reached the river again we crossed over in a coracle and walked back to Hampi along the river, visiting some more temples and ruins. We ended the day with another sunset on a rooftop and a fantastic
Castle Rock train station
dinner in the Mango Tree Restaurant.

Well, Hampi did not leave us speechless. It is not a MUST visit place for us although it is nice. Maybe the crowds were to much - but anyway it is very touristy. The landscape is beautiful and the ruins are beautiful - we missed the special spirit we heard about so often. We simply did not get it. We had a good time, it was nice to see all the ruins, there are some relaxed places to hang out and have a good time. But that's it. 4 days of ruins were enough. We were ruined ;-) by the ruins and the prices here.

So if you want to go to Hampi, do it. You will have a good time. But avoid peak season when you will not get a bed cheaper than 1000 rupees for a cramped room (if you can get a bed at all).

Curiously about what was coming next, we took the bus to Bagalkot? Never heard of this place? No problem, you are not alone....... That is our next blog.

On the way to Salem 1
OUR TRIP TO KERALA




Visit to the God’s own country by car was in our plan for quite some time. Dussera holidays during end October gave that opportunity. We (Myself and my wife Munia) were consulting various websites from the net to select the route. We visited Munnar and Thekaddy earlier around five years back. However Kerala is world famous for its backwaters. This time we thought of visiting the backwaters of Kerala. We decided to cover three places which are well known for backwaters i.e Alpuzah (Alleppy), Kumarakom and Kottayam in between.

These places were far away (more than 500 kms) from Bangalore. Moreover a substantial stretch was thru hilly tracks I.e Western Ghat section, since we would cross the Western Ghat mountain ranges. Hence we decided to break in-between. Another attraction was various off-season hotel discount offered by different travel-sites.

After studying various alternatives, finally we decided to visit KUMAROKAM with a halt in MUNNAR. ALPUZAH was near to KUMAROKAM. We would return thru Wayanad. It would be a trip of five days altogether. Google Map would be our guide to show the route. Most important was the role of the navigator (Munia)
Hotel Annamalai Udmulpet
to provide the direction, while I would be on the wheel.

Accommodation was booked in MUNNAR(22nd), KUMAROKAM (23rd), ALPUZAH(24th) & SULTAN BATHERY, WAYANAD (25th) thru various websites.



21st October, 2015 - UDUMULPETTAI



With tour plan finalised, we started from Bangalore at around 10 am. Delay was due to certain unavoidable pre-occupations in the morning. Last night, Petrol tanks were filled in (35 ltrs) and air checked of the car in the shell petrol pump near to our house.



Munnar was around 500 kms or around nine to ten hours journey by car from Bangalore. Today’s program was to reach Munnar if possible, otherwise to stay en-route at night and reach Munnar next day morning.

First one hour there was heavy traffic till we reached the first toll gate (Rs 45) to catch the elevated lengthy flyover thru electronic city. Traffic was occasionally slow and there were few crossings upto the second toll gate(Rs 25). We reached Hosur (Tamilnadu-40 kms from B’lore) at around 11.15 am.

NH 7 is a 6 lane highway and ideal for driving. Gradually we were passing hills on both sides as well as
Entering Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary
in the horizon. I was tempted to put pressure on the accelerator. It was a sunny day with beautiful atmosphere. We reached Krishnagiri (91 km from B’lore) at around 12 pm.

We passed a tollgate (Rs 60) to enter Krishnagiri. The six lane road was so smooth, the engine was joyfully acknowledging its acceptance. I could hear that the car was singing. The road was moving to the horizon like a serpent passing thru the glaring sunny atmosphere. It was a pleasure to drive.

Next toll gate was at Thoppur (Rs 86). Soon we were near Salem (Tamil Nadu). Surrounding nature with hills filled with green cover was excellent to watch. Slowly no. of windmills appeared on the hill-top. We were feeling hungry. The tollgate boy suggested Adyar Ananda Bhawan at Salem would be a good choice for having a good quality lunch.

Salem was around 202 kms from Bangalore. The restaurant was deep inside Salem city. We had to deviate around 1.5 km from NH 7 to reach our destination. We could reach our destination thru Google maps, but half an hour additional time was lost. However it was a good veg lunch, nice to enjoy
Forest Checkpost
since we were hungry.

We started from Salem at around 2.30 pm. There are various alternative routes for Munnar from here. One alternative was Bangalore – Dindigul – Theni – Bodi – Pooppara – Munnar route . As we gathered from the websites, road condition would be better in this route, but it was lengthy. We selected Bangalore- Hosur- Salem- Perundurai- Dharapuram - Udumalaipettai- Marayoor- Munnar route for our journey since this route passes thru Chinner Wildlife Sanctuary and had immense natural beauty.

There was some indication board to deviate from NH 7 towards Perundurai. Unfortunately we missed the board and proceeded further. I was little perplexed. But my guide (Munia) assured a better alternative as suggested by the google map. We decided to proceed thru this route. We crossed Namakkal (254 kms) and then Karoor (298 km). In between we crossed another toll gate-Rs.42).

From Aravakurichi (324 km) we took a right turn and entered SH 193 and then SH 84C towards Dharapuram . This state highway in Tamilnadu was a two lane road, but properly maintained except few places. We passed Dharapuram (370 km) and reached Udulmulpet (408 Kms) at around 5 pm thru Dharapuram
On the way to Maryoor
- Udmulpettai road. So far we travelled 408 Kms.

Munnar was around 90 Kms from Udulmulpet. However the next drive would be on hilly tracks and in dense forest areas. Hence we decided not to proceed further.

Hotel Annamalai (Rs 650/-) was a place with basic facilities and Parking lot. The allotted room was broad enough but Munia was not satisfied with cleanliness. Nevertheless it was ok for overnight stay. However need for mosquito repellent was felt.

On the way we noticed an eating place just in front of the bus stand. We started walking towards that to have food. Suddenly there was a big sound of applying brakes and we saw a huge accident on the road. Two motorcycles with pillon-riders collided with each other at high speed, possibly from the opposite side. Three or four persons were lying in the road in a pull of blood. Luckily, two ambulances reached the spot immediately and carried the victim. We had to appreciate the immediate response to medical emergencies which might save those precious lives.



22/10/2015 MUNNAR



A beautiful sunny morning. Today our route was thru Western Ghats and amidst thick
NH 209 Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary
forests of Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. We started at around 7 AM in the morning. Filling petrol was the first requirement, since no petrol bunk would be available till Munnar, once we leave Udulmulpet. Munia was asking to fill our belly also, but I insisted to proceed without wasting much time. Little confusion regarding the route to be adopted, but Google map was the guide. Once we left the town, the scenario was changing gradually. Hills and greeneries were calling us. After around half an hour we came across the first check-post to enter the forest. We had to write our names, destination and car no in the register. Check post personnel indicated for some tips which we ignored.

Road (NH 209) was narrow and going towards the uphill. We entered the western ghat ranges and the forest. There are lot of twists and turns on the road. It was quite narrow and rough in various places. Natural beauty was excellent. I was careful in driving while enjoying the amazing nature.

The second check-post came after few kilometres. We entered Kerala. Here also we had to write our whereabouts.

Monkeys. They were in large nos., naughty and looking
Nearing Munnar
for eatables. While entering our details in the checkpoint, we were surrounded by monkey regiment. Munia was frightened. Luckily all the car-windows were closed. Gradually we entered the deep forest. Roads were further rough, going up hills, with no of hairpin bends. The whole environment was calm and cool with sounds of birds occasionally. We stopped the vehicle at one place for quite sometime to feel the quietness.


This forest has no of wild animals including tigers, elephants and defers. We could not see any large animals except monitor, squirrel and varieties of birds. There were lot of sandalwood trees as also rare medicinal plants. Any way our knowledge was little in these areas.



At around 9 am we reached Maryoor ( 45 Kms from Udmulpet ). It was a small hill station before Munnar. A beautiful place with shops and market as also lodging facilities. We had tea break and also to take few snaps. May be, we could have stopped here yesterday by proceeding further. After few yards, we noticed a Kali temple too. Munia went inside to see and offer prayers.


A good place to have breakfast was
Approach to Munnar 1
in our radar. We got that. A nearby Hotel named Sarovar was managed by a lady. A menu list was hanging with various Kerala food as also beef. Beef is a controversial item nowadays. However we observed that there was no such taboo in Kerala. We noticed that subsequently also in the later part of our journey. Hindus and Muslims, Christians all were co-existing and running business here in harmony. We had breakfast with Appam ,omelette and potato sambar (obviously with tea at the end). With burning stomach the food was extremely delightful.

Posters, hoardings of two well known political parties (Congress & CPM) were spread out all along the road-side. Subsequently we found the same in almost all the places we visited. We heard that Panchayat Election was going to take place very soon throughout Kerala.

Now we were driving thru sandalwood forest and nearing Munnar. Tea garden started in between.

Next stoppage was at LAKKOM Falls on the way to Munnar. We had to climb a bit uphill. Entry fee was Rs. 20. With monsoon just ended, waterfall had ample water. Large no. of tourists alighted into the water. Some of them were taking bath
Beautiful flowers Munnar
also. After a brief photo session we decided to resume our journey. It was already 10 am and we were getting late to reach our destination. We had a taste of green coconut water (Color of the coconut was reddish). Taste was salty. Munia was negotiating for a hat to tackle the sun, but shopkeeper did not come down to the bargain.

Before Munnar, Eravikulam National Park was also on the way. This is one of the major tourist spots in Munnar. But we observed a huge rush of tourists in que in the ticket counter. We left the idea of entering. Any way we enjoyed the forest and the bountiful nature in our journey.

Munnar is one of the most favourite hill stations in India. Located in the western ghatranges (around 1800 Mtrs above sea level) it is one of the most favourite holiday destination in South India. Covered with greeneries and tea plantation, it presents a spectacular view of natural beauty. Low flying clouds and pristine, mist-filled valleys made Munnar one of the tourist hotspot.

This breath taking beauty of nature was overwhelming. Various flowers were blooming with wide varieties of color. We saw green
Tea Garden Munnar
tea bushes, tea gardens with vast greeneries. Mountain ranges touched the blue sky. Small tiny houses were visible in the distant Valleys. This is Munnar. Nature has opened its bounties here. We stopped the car in various places. Each place seemed to be unique in its beauty. We both felt much younger. Photo session continued for long. We entered Munnar town at around 12 pm.

Hotel West Wood Riverside was selected thru Makemytrip (Rs. 2500 rental). Hotel was located at around a km from the central point of Munnar at the bank of Mudhirapuzam river. We were alloted a room with river view. The river was not very wide (like any other river in the hill side), but with enough current. We sighted motor boats sailing the river quietly, carrying tourists. The river took a nice right turn after a while. The water was crystal clear, as if the river surface was visible from the top. Mountains of Munnar stood tall on the other side of the river. Another noticeable point was that there was no construction obstructing the view. Thus the scenic beauty was wide open. A good location to enjoy the nature.


We parked
MUDHIRAPUZAM RIVER VIEW FROM HOTEL AT MUNNAR
the car inside the hotel courtyard. Front office reception was ok, but in response to the query regarding sight seeing arrangement they had responded that it was already late for having a day sightseeing (Rs. 2000 per trip) today. However they could arrange for night jeep safari at Chinnar wild sanctuary (Rs. 2000 per trip). The visit would be for around three hours beginning from 10 pm.

Our previous experience of jungle safari arranged by forest department in various forests showed that the probability of noticing large animals had been quite low. Comparatively private safari had been more successful (of course risky in terms of dependability).

We decided to explore Munnar on our own. Beginning at around 2 pm we reached the Mattupetty Dam on the Eravikulam Lake first. It was a huge lake with exquisite natural beauty and surrounded by hills. There was heavy rush of tourists enjoying the beauty of the lake and surrounding areas. On proceeding further passing thru the right side of the lake, we came across Echo Point and few other tourist spots. No lunch today except street foods at nearby stalls adjacent to the Lake.

Our final destination was the “View
MATTUPETTY DAM
Point” which was around 24 Kms from the lake in the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border and a favourite tourist spot to watch the Sunset. Sky was overcast, but we decided to take a chance. Gradually the route was going up-hills with narrow hilly roads.

We reached the spot at around 5’o clock. Vehicles are not allowed after a particular point. After that the walkway was extended nearly a kilometre or so with both sides going down at least thousand feet deep, as if we were walking on top of a hill. It was an interesting place but distant horizon was not visible since both sides were plunged in deep fog.

We saw a hotel (named Hotel Periyar Residency) in that place, definitely an ideal place for lodging. It was very cold (much more cool compared to Munnar). We refreshed ourselves with omelette. According to Munia the size of the egg was unusually large. Clearing her doubts, the shopkeeper ensured that it was indeed a chicken egg (and not anything else).

Munia was delighted to acquire the long-cherished hat at last. This shopkeeper came down to the bargain and the hat was bought.

We came back to hotel
Top Point Munnar
at around 8 PM. Feeling extremely tired Munia wanted to have the dinner in the hotel room but the food rates were painful. I noticed a Gujarati eating place on the way and selected the place for finishing my dinner. Food was served after a long wait nevertheless it was north Indian type, hence acceptable.



23/10/2015 MUNNAR- KUMAROKAM



Morning break-fast was complimentary. Apart from the quality of food, the most noteworthy feature was the location of the eating place. The courtyard adjacent to the restaurant was in an open area covered with glass-pane at the top. Enjoying breakfast therein with a magnificent view of the river, adjoining mountains and light morning sunshine was a delightful experience. In fact this was the best place of that hotel.

At around 9 PM we began our journey to the next destination, Kumarakom, which was around 150 KMs from Munnar. According to Google Map, the journey would be via Kalarkutty- Koothattkulam-Perumthuruthu - Muthalakodam -Thodupuzah- Kuravilangad-

Perumthuruthu - Kumarakom route.

We commenced our journey thru NH 49. After around half an hour the Map suggested for a shorter route. Near Ambaddy estate we took left turn.
HOTEL KTDC WATERSCAPES KUMARAKOM
This road was narrow with lot of curves and sharp bends. We were moving amongst large tea estates. There were lot of resorts/Home Stays in both sides of the road. Soon, a river emerged on the left side. It was accompanying us for next half an hour or so. There were localities in between and the narrowness of the road made negotiating with the incoming vehicles quite difficult. Ultimately we reached NH 49 once again.

It was already 1 PM. Feeling hungry, we had lunch in a place called Kuravilangad. It was a ordinary eating place with localites. We ordered two Kerala Fish Meals. Two /three types of vegetables were served without any limit, with Kerala rice. Vegetables were tasteful but the fish curry disappointed me.

Road was divided in this place. One road was moving towards Kottayam and another to Kumarakom. We resumed our journey at around 1.30 PM. After driving nearly one hour or so thru narrow roads as directed by my navigator (Munia) in slow speed, when we reached Kumarakom, it was around 3 PM.

Lake VEMBANAD is a huge fresh-water lake stretching Kumarakom and Alpuzah. This lake is at the confluence of three
KUMARAKOM BIRD SANCTUARY
rivers (Periyar, Meenachil and Pampa). Kumarakom is situated in the eastern coast of lake VEMBANAD. The whole area is a network of rivulets and canals. Boats are the main mode of transport. Taking the lake as waterfront, these canals constitute backwaters.

Another important feature is that the adjoining paddy fields are below sea level. The waterways are made by blocking the huge water thru barricades made of mud on both sides, miles after miles. It was a different world I had never seen before. I heard of similar place in Venice or in Bangladesh (Purba Bangla).

Kumarakom Bird Sanctuary lies on the prolific estuary of river Meenachil and embraced by lake VEMBANAD. Hotel KTDC WATERSCAPES is situated right inside the sanctuary. This place is famous for its natural beauty and migratory birds, particularly during winter.

We reached KTDC Kumarakom Resort (Rental Rs. 3455) at around 3 pm. It is a vast area within the bird sanctuary. The reception official informed that our booking was upgraded to lake-view room. We were pleasantly surprised to see the room. This wooden bungalow was elevated around 15 feet from the ground and was equipped with modern facilities but right into the
BACKWATER KUMARAKOM
nature. It was located in the bank of the lake VEMBANAD. There were several small-sized canals within the area and canal view rooms (which we originally booked and less costly) were located by the side of the canal.

View from the room balcony was exquisite. Varieties of fish catching birds were flying all around to look for prey. Occasionally the fishing boats and house boats were visible. We could see the vast lake meeting the sky in the horizon. Everything was calm & quite except the birds.

Reception person advised us to book for boat ride in advance. But subsequently it was known that all bookings for today were full. Ride could be booked only tomorrow morning. We thought of visiting the bird sanctuary now. From the entry point it was around two km walk. The entire stroll was between trees and plants. However we could not watch any migratory birds since this was not the season for birds arrival. Ideal time for bird watching was winter.


We thought of having the joy of boat ride. However house boat ride was costly. There are various kinds of house boats and the rentals starting from Rs.600
LAUNCH SERVICE KUMARAKOM
per hour. Cost further escalated depending upon the size, look, amenities and luxurious arrangements of the boat. House boat was very popular for staying amongst tourists but not cheap. We came across hundreds of house boats of different varieties plying into the lake and adjoining backwaters. Any way we had booking for boat ride tomorrow morning.

I read of a cheaper alternative in the internet. There are no of ""passenger ferries"" across different routes of considerable distance passing thru the lake. Rates are extremely low and one can enjoy the boat-riding experience at the lake. In fact it is poor man's choice of tourism.
When asked in the reception they could not provide the whereabouts. After several enquiries, we could gather the details of ferry ghat. It was not very distant from the resort. We decided to take a chance.
The ferry service was upto a place called Muhammad. Ferry service runs every half an hour. We boarded the 6 pm ferry. It was a twilight time. But the sky was almost overcast. The journey was between two points of the lake. Gradually the daylight vanished and the ferry boat slowly moved to its destination piercing
LUXURY HOUSEBOAT
the darkness. Small points of lights emerging from fisherman's boat were visible in the distant horizon. We were enjoying our journey, but a bit un-easy since there were few passengers in the launch and the destination was totally un-known to us.

After around half an hour journey, we reached the destination, Muhammad. The ferry ghat seemed to be recently renovated but had a deserted look. There was vast darkness of the lake except the lights at the ghat. On return we were the only two passengers in the entire ferry. Our adventure ended at around 8 pm. It was a nice experience.

Night buffet dinner at the resort was quite costly (Rs. 850 per head). According to me it was not worth it's cost despite having large varieties of both veg as well as non-veg dishes. There were cheaper alternative outside, but Munia did not agree.

After dinner, Walking into the huge garden within the resort was enjoying experience. There are nice walkways and we were tempted to walk.

It was 9.30 pm. I pulled the chair to the balcony and admire the dark nature with room-lights switched off. The entire atmosphere was extremely
KUMARAKOM LAKE VEMBANAD
calm and quiet. Few houseboats are seen floating in the lake.
Soon we were interrupted by various insects. It was time for a quiet sleep.

24/10/2015 KUMARAKOM-ALPUZAH




I woke up in the early morning. That was the time for birds. They were extremely busy in their routine activities. Sky was overcast yet again. Lake was still in a lazy sleepy mood with a mystic cover of light fog. I opened the glass door and noticed everything was wet due to mist at night.

Our boat ride would be from 7 AM (Rs.600 for one hour). Mr Mani would be our guide and also boat operator. He was a local man and a very friendly person. He operated our boat to the lake as well as nearby backwater. There were houses in both sides of the waterways and a dinghy or a boat at every house. It was as if we were moving thru the country road in a rickshaw, only difference was that it was waterways, not roadways. There are vast paddy fields at both sides. Interestingly, the paddy fields are below the level of backwaters.

Waters were restricted thru mud
ALPUZAH BACKWATER
barriers in both sides of the waterways, mile after mile. Was it natural or man- made, I have no idea.

Mr Mani showed the place where the boat race was organised every year during August. It was a major tourist attraction. This year the monsoon was less, affecting the crop.

There were large no of house boats floating. Many of them are fully AC, with dining table luxurious sofa-sets, placed in the front balcony.

We came back at around 8 AM in the morning. Breakfast was complimentary. With large varieties, it was a good refreshment. “Puttu” was one local tasty special variety.

Our duration of stay at Kumarakom was coming to an end. Now we have to be ready for our next destination I.e. Alpuzah.

We spent some time sitting in the garden in between the lake and our room. It was a memorable experience in Kumarakom. We liked the place.



24/10/2015 ALAPPUZAH



Alappuzah (Alleppey) City is an important tourist destination in Kerala. This town with picturesque canals, backwaters, sea beaches is described as the “Venice of the East”. The vast backwaters of Alappuzah are the
BACKWATER VIEW ALPUZAH
most popular tourist attraction. A houseboat cruise in these backwaters is a delightful experience. This place is also famous for the SNAKE BOAT-RACE organised during August every year. Tourists from all over the world come to visit Alapuzzah to watch the boat-race.

Distance between Kumarakom and Alapuzah was around 33 Kms. Commencing our drive at around 12 PM thru SH 40, we reached the giant Pallathuruthy Bridge to cross over Lake VEMBANAD.

At around 1.30 PM we reached our destination, KTDC Hotel Tamarind at Alpuzah (Rs 1200).

We booked this hotel also thru MakeMy trip. The room allotted was extremely small. Maintenance of the hotel was not up to the mark. There were barely minimum furniture inside the room. Even the room key was not operating properly. Despite intimating at the reception, there was lukewarm response. We were disappointed but there was no other choice.

The reception person was very much interested to arrange a houseboat trip for us. When we asked about the location of the jetty for availing passenger ride, he initially attempted to discourage us. Nevertheless we took an auto and reached the jetty. It was not very far from the hotel.
FERRY STATION ALPUZAH

There were ferry services commencing from this jetty to various distant places. We saw a launch about to start its voyage. The destination was difficult to pronounce and remember. However we understood that it would take more than an hour to reach that place. The launch was of two storeys. But upper deck was already full. Hence we had to contend ourselves in the lower deck. We occupied two window seats. The journey started. There were dense habitats in both sides of the waterways, large multi-storeyed buildings in certain places on the riverside.

Soon the waterway plunged into the vast backwater territories. We saw a large auditorium in a small lagoon, church, market, beautifully constructed houses all surrounded by water. The launch went on cruising from one point to another with several waterways in between. There were pedestrian over-bridges in waterways to move from one side to the other. We observed hundreds of houseboats throughout the journey. They were of different sizes, equipped with all facilities expected in a star hotel.

Like Bus-stop, there were four-five water-stops. Passengers dis-embarked and new passengers came in. After around one and half hour, we reached to the final terminus. The fare
LUXURY HOUSE BOAT ALPUZAH
was Rs 20 per head, meagre expenditure compared to the travelling cost thru houseboats but with fairly long duration.

After a brief halt, the launch began its return journey. This time we could occupy seats in the upper-deck. The fare was double i.e. Rs 40 each. Dam cheap once again. Today’s lunch was snacks and biscuits which we carried with ourselves. Once again we could experience the nice surroundings. This wonderful journey ended at around 5 PM.

We came back to hotel and refreshed ourselves with Coffee and tasteful Banana Fry. Next destination was to visit the Sea Beach. When we reached there it was almost Sun-set time. The place was full of people. Large no of shops were visible in that area selling varieties of food items, stationeries, momentos etc. No of Bengali Tourists assembled therein to enjoy the puja holidays.

At night, I had delicious dinner at the KTDC restaurant with “Kerala Curry Mean” with rice. It was a nice meal reasonably priced. Munia had to be satisfied with veg meal since it was Saturday (observing “Tirupati brata)”). The climate was humid and we were feeling very tired after continuous roaming from one place to
Beautiful Flowers Munnar 2
another through-out the day. Time to take rest as also prepare for tomorrow. Tomorrow we had to undergo a long journey to Wayanad, a distant place from here.

Hampi
Geo: 15.3333, 76.4667

Ah! Hampi! This is one awesome place to visit! In the middle of nowhere, surrounded by boulders and rocks, big and small. Two to three days is a good amout of time to see everything here. We arrived very early by overnight bus from Goa along with many other blurry eyed travellers. We spent the first day walking nearby and going up the hill for some superb scenic views.
There is also a tuk tuk tour available which most drivers will try to get you to do from the moment you step out of the bus door.
It's quite beneficial to do this tour as there is a lot to see and it's a quick way to get around. The price isn't too bad either for a full day tour. We saw many temples and even a half sunset at the end.

We also crossed the other side of the river and hired bikes to 'monkey' temple with its 600 steps to the top. It's a good little workout, especially in the heat! But you are rewarded with 360 degree views of this magical landscape. On the way back we chilled out at the laughing buddha cafe which has great
Hampi
views overlooking the river to Hampi.
We then took a overnight bus to Mysore for a few days. We visited the main palace which is quite impressive.

For one of the days we hired a taxi for a visit to Bandipur National Park for a tiger safari. It was an early start to drive the 2 hrs there. We got a private jeep, much better than a bus full of locals, and had about an hour and a half safari. We didn't see a tiger but we did wait at a spot for 30 min because apparently there was one about to arrive at the watering hole. But it never came. We didn't even see an elephant, only deer and a few birds. It was still fun but we just had no luck with the animals on that day.

It was a Saturday so maybe they were sleeping in!
On another day we went up Chamundy Hill by local bus for views overlooking the city. Unfortunately it was quite hazy and being the weekend made it very busy. One annoying thing about Mysore was that tuk tuk drivers and other people try to get you to visit silk and fabric shops
Hampi
and are quite persistent. We had to be quite firm saying no!
Our visit to Mysore had it's ups and downs so we were looking forward to a different setting as we took the overnight bus to Kerala to start a one week tour.

Hiesiges Fährboot
Nach ausgiebiger Erforschung der Städte, Strände und Berge dieses Landes wurde es Zeit mich ins ländliche Indien zu begeben. Der an Goa angrenzende Bundesstaat Karnataka schien mir dafür gut geeignet. Nach einer rumpeligen und daher etwas schlafarmen Fahrt mit einem Nachtbus (ironischerweise Sleeperbus genannt) kam ich dort in einem mir zuvor völlig unbekannten Dorf namens Hampi an. Dieser Ort befindet sich inmitten des Ruinenfeldes der vor 500 Jahren untergegangenen großen Stadt Vijayanagar, die zur Zeit ihrer Zerstörung 500.000 Menschen beheimatet haben soll. Typisch Indien hat sich in all diesen Jahren niemand gefunden dort aufzuräumen 😉 Das Ergebnis ist eine unwirklich scheinende Landschaft voller eigentümlicher Hügel aus großen Felsbrocken zwischen denen Ruinen alter Paläste, Tempel und Forts verstreut liegen. Das Ganze ist oft von Nebeln durchzogen und in ein seltsames Licht getaucht, das von allen Seiten gleichzeitig zu kommen scheint. Ich betrat Hampi zu Sonnenaufgang direkt vor dem einzigen noch erhaltenen und noch benutzten Tempel, aus dem ein eigenartiger, durchgehender Hindugesang zu hören war. Ein wahrlich eindrucksvoller Empfang!



Niemand schien es hier eilig zu aben. Alles schien so gemächlich voranzugehen wie der Fluß, der an dem Ort vorbeifließt. So wartete ich gemütlich bis das Fährboot langsam den Betrieb aufnahm,
Felsen soweit das Auge reicht
setzte ans andere Ufer über und suchte mir dort eine Unterkunft inmitten der Felder . Die dort versammelten Traveller waren eine bunt zusammengewürfelte und gemütliche Gruppe, in der ich mich schnell heimisch fühlte. Witzigerweise traf ich hier auch auf überraschend viele bekannte Gesichter, Leute, die ich zuvor in anderen Teilen Indiens getroffen hatte. Viele waren auch Kletterer, die eigens fürs Bouldering auf den unzähligen hiesigen Felsbrocken hierher gekommen waren. Die Tage in Hampi vergingen wie im Flug und waren aufgelockert durch Aktivitäten wie Klettern, Wanderungen in den Ruinenfeldern und auf den umliegenden Hügeln, Schwimmen am hiesigen Stausee und Motorradausflügen ins Umland. Oder man spannte sich einfach eine Hängematte zwischen den Palmen auf und las etwas. Am Abend versammelten sich viele von uns zum Beobachten des Sonnenuntergangs auf einem der Hügel und der eine oder andere brachte Instrumente mit, um das Ganze mit improvisierter Musik zu untermalen. So läßt sichs aushalten! Oder wie der Inder sagt: Om Shanti!



Gut erholt und voller neuer Ideen wird es nun Zeit mich von Indien zu verabschieden. Die verschiedenen Orte die ich hier besucht habe waren teils so unterschiedlich, daß mir Indien oft wie eine Vielzahl verschiedener Länder erschien und ich bin
Sonnenuntergang - immer wieder ein Highlight
mir sicher, daß ich bei weitem noch nicht alles gesehen habe, daß es hier zu sehn gibt. Aber es gibt ja immer ein nächstes Mal!

Murudeshwar
Determined to hit the beach immediately after lunch, we left home by 5.30am. The drive was scenic with great roads Router: Tumkur- Davangere - Yellapur- Ankola - Gokarna.

Reached Kudle Beach resort by 2pm with a couple of breaks. It was a lovely resort with an awesome view of the Kudle beach. The beach is a 500m trek away which was fun in its own way. The first evening was just beach beach beach. Having totally fearless kids adds to the beach fun 😊

Bang opposite the resort is a beautiful hillock. We had heard that the sunset from up the hillock would be good, but were awestruck when we reached the top. The ocean view, the rocks, trek down to the waters and the entire green area left us spell bound and to top it all we were the only ones in the entire hillock. If you walk across the hill, you will reach a Rama temple. The ancient temples of Gokarna are a delight to any spiritual person 😊 The calmness and aura cannot be explained. We get a panoramic view of the Arabian sea from here and the Gokarna beach is just a few meters walk.
Kotitheertha at Gokarna town


Opposite the Kudle resort is a Shiva cave. The cave is small and dark and there is a 2500 years old linga inside. The cave apparently leads to Uttar Kashi. Filled with bats and just a small hole for sunlight to enter, meditating in this place would surely get you closer to yourself!

A few kilometers away from Kudle beach is Om beach. After getting used to the clean, calm, beautiful, less populated Kudle beach, we were not too impressed with Om beach and returned quickly.

A must do for old town and temple lovers is a visit to the Gokarna town. We drove to the Mahabaleshwar temple. The temple has the 'Atma Linga' kept a few feet under ground. Ganesha had saved the Atma Linga (worshipped for Immortality) from Ravana (you can get more details here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murudeshwara). Don't miss the Anna Prasanna if you reach there between 12 to 2pm which happens everyday for all!

The roads around the temple have the culture of incredible India retained and the architecture of the houses is beautiful. The roads lead to the Kotitheertha which is a pond in the centre of the town. A walk around the
Kudle Beach
pond is a definite must-do.

Murudeshwar is a 90km 1.5hr drive from Gokarna. You just reach there and a magnificent 125 feet Shiva statue awaits you! The Gopuram is 237 feet and there is a huge statue of little ganesha deceiving Ravana right in front of the Shiva idol. You must visit the place during sunset to see Shiva in the ocean background with the orange light adding beauty to the already spectacular scene. You can reach the Gopuram top via a lift and have a great view as well. The beach was of course crowded but the view of Shiva and the Gopuram from the beach was amazing!

Gokarna - Kudle beach is no doubt one of the best beach for people who love to go right in and enjoy the waves but the city's beauty is doubled due to its spiritual feel! Definitely a place we would visit several times 😊

Fish Thali
So even though I'm 5 months behind on my entries (I still have photos to post of Italy, France, and Spain), I'm trying to stay on of this trip. Also, my parents would probably shun me if I didn't share the pictures of all of my meals, which could end up being the whole trip anyway if tonight was any indication.



We took off from Dubai this afternoon and set off for Bangalore to meet my wife's brother, who has been working here the past 5 months. The 4 hour flight was uneventful, relatively calm and no hiccups along the way, which was good since my wife had minor nightmares that we'd be thrown back on the plane. Alas, we made it and after we claimed our luggage we found my brother-in-law amongst the throng of hired drivers looking for their patrons. We took a taxi from the airport to our hotel took about an hour and a half door to door. About halfway through my wife turned to me and said Dramamine would have been a good thing to bring. I had that thought about 20 minutes earlier as our cab driver had passed 15 people, braked
2
hard three or four times for speed bumps, and honked at everything that was alive. Once to the hotel, it was a smooth evening from there. We had dinner at what most people probably wouldn't call a hole in the wall type of place, though it was up 2 flights of rickety stairs which may have holes in the wall. The food was incredible as I had the fish thali, which was fried fish and a collection of other dishes as well. It was delicous though may have set a crazy high standard for food over the next week.





We go into downtown Bangalore tomorrow and the a wildlife sanctuary on Friday. No word yet if I can ride a tiger though I'm just going to assume I can until someone says I can't...

Sandstone temple
The initial draw for Mysore was the yoga (for P mainly). Apparently there are many yoga centres offering classes and some even offering courses. After getting the yoga bug in Indonesia, P placed Mysore firmly on our itinerary. Of course Mysore is more than just a yoga hub, it's a huge modern city; with wide one way roads, colonial style buildings, a palace and a large cathedral. We likened it to Jaipur when we arrived but far more cleaner and organised. Before getting here we pictured it to be a lot smaller and less busy. How naive of us. This is India.

There's an overnight train that goes straight from Hospet (near Hampi) to Mysore. We were on that train. But due to a major oversight on our part we had booked it only part way to Bangalore and had booked a separate train 2 hrs later from Bangalore to Mysore. We had no idea why we had done this, only realising our error as we boarded the train. We had 2 choices: We stick to our schedule and get off at Bangalore and wait for our next train OR try and stay on this one and feign confusion
Local street seller
when asked for the ticket...At around 7am the conductor came along and woke us out of our sleep to tell us we we're in Bangalore. P shown him our tickets and told him we wanted to go to Mysore. He looked at our ticket, wobbled his head, scribbled on his paper and then went on his way. We love the relaxed rules of India.

Looking through our guide book, there didn't seem like a hell of a lot to do in Mysore, and we were supposed to be there for 2.5 days. Also since arriving in India we learnt that doing yoga here wasn't as straight forward. Apparently its the more remote resorts such as retreats in the jungle somewhere away from any other hint of civilisation. Many of them being more like schools/colleges where you'd need a student visa to attend, not just a basic tourist visa! No yoga for P.

After settling into our fancy hotel (there is only one budget hostel outside the city, whereas we wanted to be in it) we stepped out into the cool refreshing air of Mysore. It wasn't cold by any means but the humidity was a lot
A grand catholic church
lower than previous places, which we were so grateful for.

Just around the corner from our hotel was a large cathedral (built in 1931). We decided to pay it a quick visit, as when you think of India, Christianity and cathedrals rarely spring to mind.
**Fun fact: The minister who married us back in England was Indian**
The cathedral looked pretty large from the outside and in good condition. It automatically reminded us of the many cathedrals and churches back home from stone structure alone. We stuck our heads through the door to admire the architecture inside as a service was taking place with hymns sung in kannada (local dialect). The inside was pretty much the same as any other church really, with pews on both sides and the aisle down the middle leading towards the pulpit.

We had barely walked down the street on the main road before a rickshaw driver approached us. He said he would take us into town for 20rupees (which a very good price for tourists). We asked him to take us towards the city palace, where all the eateries were. On the way he was telling us about
The palace draws its inspiration from many countries and faiths
how the people in Mysore were very nice, friendly and don't overcharge foreigners. ""Trust me"" he said. Stopping just outside of the palace, he started giving us info on where's best to eat, mentioning some silk and fabric market and the opening/lunch times of the palace. He offered to take us to all these places and more. We declined his offer and asked him to just drop us near the palace where we could get food. For some reason he started driving us in the complete opposite direction of the palace, ready to take us to some restaurant he mentioned earlier, away from everywhere else. Getting stressed we told him to take us back the way we came. It seems the trick here is rickshaw driver’s offer extremely low priced journeys but will then earn commission for taking you to 'recommended' places. Highly frustrating, especially when you are hungry but to his dismay we refused to give in and we were finally dropped off where we were asked to be. The only reason he did this is because we took his phone number with a plan to call him once we had finished (we certainly were no fool).

The grand palace of Mysore
Finding a popular eatery called RRR restaurant, with a very basic menu selection but offering a unique experience we took a seat inside. P ordered the veg thali meal whilst Chris ordered a chicken biriyani. All meals here are served on a banana leaf and diners are to be ate with your hands. P was served a poppadom, rice and about 6/7 sauces, Chris had his biriyani with 2 sauces. We were both stuffed after eating the mountains of rice they gave us but it was really tasty meal and cheap too.

After lunch we headed to the city palace. A fairly large complex with a fusion of Hindu, Islamic and English architecture. From its red minarets on the outside to the huge ceiling and wall paintings of Hindu deities to the bronze lion statues throughout. This place was truly grand. The original was actually made out of wood and burnt down in 1897. The building we seen today was built in 1912 by an English architect. We took the audio tour around the palace (free for tourists) stopping at highlighted points to get an idea of what we were looking at. Unfortunately taking photos inside is forbidden
so we don't have any snaps of the grandiosity of the architecture here or the lifelike paintings drawn from photos. The huge columns, the enormous chandeliers hanging from the ceiling, the stained glass windows and the burmese teak wood with ivory ingrained it, really shown off the amount of money flying around the royal family at the time. There was also a residential part for visitors to walk through but we gave it a miss. Palace fatigue.

We sat outside for the rest of the afternoon admiring the views of the palace and people watching whilst planning our next move. Both feeling slightly exhausted we decided we would cut our time short here and head to our next destination further south for some relaxation by the coast and the backwaters. The business of India’s roads and towns had finally taken its toll on us and maybe that short stint in Goa also shown us what else we could be enjoying in India. We somehow managed to find a train leaving the following day and booked it straight away. Despite reserving 2 nights at our hotel online, the manager was very kind and only charged us for the one night
Baa baa yellow sheep...
we stayed and cancelled our 2nd night with no fuss. After checking out he even gave us fruit juice, omelette, toast and a free taxi to the train station - all on the house. Maybe we should stay in hotels more often. We think the fact that P promised to write a good review for them on trip advisor also helped.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
September 4th 2015
Published: December 7th 2015


Hampi; described as one of the most bewitching and spell-bounding landscapes with sandy temples and ruins dotted across some of the most spectacular scenery. Now a world heritage site, but in its prime it is believed Hampi was once one of the richest and largest kingdoms in the world. Take that you other built up ugly capital cities. In other words Hampi is generally described as a place not to be missed on a trip to southern India.

Furthermore it was off the tourist trail of Rajasthan. Saying all of this, before we arrived we could not get ourselves excited for Hampi as we enjoyed our few days of relaxation in Goa and had seen enough palaces and temples to last a lifetime by now. Did we really want to see another one, two or even more? We just didn’t have the energy for any.

However we were right to visit. Hampi was truly magical. As soon as we set eyes on this place we were struck by the beauty of it. It was like nothing we had laid eyes on before in India or anywhere else. Once again I would say pictures and even words do not do
These children loved having their picture taken
this place justice. Either way let us try to explain.

One of the first things that caught our eye in Hampi was the unusual landscape. Piles of mountains were made up of circular round boulders, like very large pebbles. Some small, others giant sized, all laid on top of each other as if they were purposefully placed. These boulders looked dusty in texture and sandy in colour. They sat in contrast to the sharp blue skies and sparkling blue river that snaked its path through this heritage site. Then there were the bright greens from the rice terraces. It all looked like the perfect natural and calming environment, very quiet in places and far removed from the cities we had previously visited.

Plus there was more to this place than meets the eye. On second glance, located across the sandy boulder terrain were temples that blended so effortlessly into their surrounds. After all they were made using the boulders that surround them. Once you spotted one, your eyes began to train themselves and you could see one more, two more, and then many more revealing themselves.

Unlike the other grand marble and mosaic filled palaces we were
Stone ruins amongst the stones
used to seeing in Rajasthan, these were far smaller in scale. However you have to bear in mind that they are not a true reflection of what they once were (as after all this whole site is now in ruins). What remains is many smallish square structures with columns bringing the builds (very open in design) together. In some ways it reminded us of Angkor Wat in Cambodia and Bagan in Myanmar but yet still so different. Although the temples may be more impressive in the latter two sites the scenery here tops them both. It was stunning and came without the hordes of tourists you see at Angkor Wat.

Plus we were about to have another first on this trip as we were to experience an ancient method of travelling across water…









After arriving we decided last minute to base ourselves on the ‘hippie’ side of town. Across from the river away from the main clustered Hampi Bazaar with the maze like narrow streets sitting beside Virupaksha Temple. We were located in more natural surrounds - plus we had with a perfect view of the temple and the boulders
Braving the intense heat for some sightseeing
that dotted the terrain across the river. We certainly wanted calm and tranquil by this point. Guesthouses here were small and quaint all located down one dirt-path backed by many rice terraces and rocky hills.


After crossing the river by the small overcrowded motor boat (30 second ride) we initially settled at Nargilla home stay but after a few hours of no power we decided to move to Sunny Guesthouse that had 24hrs electricity thanks to a backup generator.

Sunny Guesthouse was initially on our list. However as it had a lonely planet status we tried to avoid it. Sometimes LP's suggestions take their LP status as all they need to increase prices and lower standards. Sunny guesthouse was surprisingly rather pleasant with circular huts. Either wooden or cement based and were quaint and clean with fans. All for 400 rupees. It actually surprised us how much room we had inside one of the circular huts (bathroom included). They can be deceiving from the outside.



The locals here were friendly and not too pushy, and the ones that could speak English made an effort to remember our names. One old villager with
IMG_7406
limited English asked Chris if he was from Japan. Haha not quite.

After getting ready, and waiting at the boat dock a group of children made a beeline for P and her camera all asking for their pictures to be taken. It was quite nice at first but then annoying to see some of the kids become far too aggressive towards one another so that they could have their picture continually taken. We did manage to take some adorable pictures though.


Most locals were friendly, however we did encounter a very annoying rickshaw driver. Once we had crossed the river he practically attached himself to us. We decided to go for something to eat hoping he would get the hint and so we could gain some clarity on our plan for the day. Sadly this did not stop the rickshaw driver from waiting for us. Slightly annoyed by this we told him where we intended to walk around today and would not be getting a rickshaw. After finishing our food and leaving, this rickshaw driver continually offered us day tours. We were as clear as possible when we told him we did not need his service
tranquil
and wished to be left alone. Nevertheless this guy thought it would be useful for his rickshaw business to them inform us he would be very angry with us if we proceeded to go with someone else. This really annoyed us but at least this would be the last of him we thought. Nope he was still following us. We stopped again to ask him what he wanted only to receive the response that he intended to follow us to ensure we did not get another rickshaw driver.

This guy was very rude and insistent. Despite being very frustrated by this point we decided to continue with our day and ignore this guy. We decided to go to the tourist office. Rickshaw driver nevertheless in tow walking behind us. When we entered the temple he stayed at the gate. In the tourism office (located in Virupaksha Temple) we found out they were offering bicycle tours around the ruins as the distant between them was not very far (despite what many rickshaw drivers tell people) plus we would be given a guide providing information on the history. What a delightful way to explore the ruins we thought to ourselves. We
Conical boats have been used for centuries here
signed up for the following day.



After exiting the temple, you’ll never guess who was waiting for us. That annoying rude rickshaw driver. We told him we had signed up for a tour and he began shouting and screaming in our faces. He then proceeded to call the tourism guide out of the tourism office for stealing his customers. We were quite shocked by it all and wanted to get as far away from this idiot as possible. As we walked off, a fellow guide told us we should report him to the police as it is not the first time he had done this to tourists and he should not get away with it as along with his threatening demeanour he was also shouting profanities to us (not in English) and the tourism office man.

As we walked away he did not follow physically but kept his eye on us. What a creepy experience, we were both shaken by it. Luckily we did not see him again apart from at the boat dock the following day but apart from asking how our bike tour was in an overly jovial manner he ignored us as he
Can you take my picture...eek
accepted there was no custom here.

Anyway less about this guy and more about this majestic place of Hampi. We decided that we would spend the rest of the day exploring the temples located beside the river on foot. As we followed the beautiful trail that snaked beside the river we came across some completely abandoned sites. We were mesmerised by Hampi. It was such a beautiful place. Thank god we took this trail on possible on foot too instead of the rickshaw as we would have missed the delightful walk beside the river. No rickshaws can travel this route.

Our surrounding was mesmerising and it was very tranquil. As we stopped at some of the many ruins along the way although we knew very little about the history of these abandoned stone buildings we were mesmerised by the whole setting of it. Not too many tourists at all and instead many Indian families walking this trail or sat down for a Indian style picnic bringing more colour to this amazing site with their colourful saris. Added to this was the odd monkey which did not seem to be too distracted by us at all.

circle of life
Just looking at the giant round rock boulders that were all precariously standing upon one another looking as if any minute they may topple. We asked ourselves how they came to be and later found out that there are 2 theories to explain this unusual rock formation.

The first theory many Hindu people adopt relates to a rock fight between two gods, leaving behind these circular shaped boulders. The second theory relates to natural erosion from the strong winds blowing sand across the rocks creating a sandpaper effect and rounding many of the boulders off. We’ll leave it to you to decide.

After lots of picture taking and as much sun exposure that we could manage we walked back towards the boat jetty. On our way we got speaking to the most delightful children, many siblings and cousins on vacation with their families. They were between the ages of 4 and 13 and could speak very good English. They asked us many questions about us and our trip and also told us lots about where they were from in Calcutta and Mumbai. Chris also proved to be one of the little girl’s hero when he spotted
P getting comfy for sunset
a monkey behind her ready to snatch the corn on the cob she had in her hand, scaring it away. This was a lovely past time here, as apart from that unfriendly rickshaw driver many others were very friendly.

On the morning of our bicycle tour we got talking to the rest of our group, a British guy living in the states, a mixed couple; German guy and Ecuadorian girl and 3 guys from India on vacation here. All very friendly.

The tour started in Virupaksha temple and we were given a brief history of Hampi here. Our guide explained that the Hampi site was built in the 14th century as a Hindu kingdom. Its main purpose however was the trade of precious stones and gems. This kingdom was very successful with many visitors from Europe coming across and trading for some of these precious stones. He described a scene of the main road (outside this temple) bustling with elephants, camels, horses and the traders that rode them. We couldn’t quite picture this tranquil place in such away and were taken by surprise by a painting illustrating a scene that once was. It looked like a
Looks like its waving to a friend
bustling area just like any other in India (far from what it is today) but with a very grand feel to it as all the buyers for the precious gems rode their highly decorated Camels and Elephants.

We were informed that this kingdom was very successful at the time. That was until the sultans from further south stole the stones and destroyed most of the temples only leaving a few standing. We were both surprised by the trustworthiness back then which led to such a steal. It was quite normal for traders to cover their precious stones with blankets alone at the end of the day before they went home and this was when the ransacking took place. They were clearly not expecting such an attack.

Although the attack was initially an attack to gain more money and power as the sultans were initially after the precious stones, as they continued to demolish most of the temples here it soon turned into religious fight between Hindus & Muslims. The fight broke out into a war and left Hampi abandoned for many years.

For us, one sad thing about Hinduism is that once a temple
Jump and wave
or statue of a god is destroyed you cannot carry on worshipping at that sight. Once damaged it is no longer a temple, it is believed the spiritual essence of the place disappears and does not ever return even if the broken temple/statute is repaired. It therefore becomes a monument. This site therefore has lost most of its religious significance.

One thing our guide shed light on that had otherwise puzzled us on this trip was the erotic carvings etched onto many of temples we had visited. Quite surprising to see especially when you take a closer look. Our guide explained that these images are meant to distract evil spirits away from something so beautiful i.e ‘the temple’. Okay that makes sense but I bet the artists had a lot of fun creating them though.

The same idea applies to the babies with black make up under their eyes and sometimes with a huge mole drawn onto their faces. We always asked ourselves why people could be so cruel to their babies smearing them with so much black makeup. Well all was revealed… the black make up is meant to protect the baby by confusing the
Scenic Hampi
evil spirits that the beautiful baby is not in fact beautiful. We liked this idea, although we are not sure about how far we would go in adopting this ourselves.

Over the 5 hours of the tour we cycled from one site to another (with very little distance between them) and were given some information on their history. One commonality between them all was the destruction of the temples, shrines and even the palace. The palace was a huge complex and with all the building knocked down you could only get a feel for it from the foundation of squares that remained on the ground. Such a shame. Apart from being directly in the sunlight, we enjoyed the bike tour. It was very informative illustrating key features and designs of temples you may have otherwise missed. On one temple there was a 7 animal figure made up of an elephant, tiger, rabbit, crocodile and some other interesting creatures. We would have completely missed this without our guide.

Along with this tour another enjoyable past time during the day were the few rides we took on one of those unique river crossing vessels. These were in fact circular
Smile for the camera
conical boats which surprisingly have been around for a long time in many Middle Eastern countries. Interestingly there is a new theory around the famous story of Noah’s ark which is not only significant to the Bible, but the Quran and Torah (albeit with different names). It is argued with some pressing evidence that if such a thing existed it was certainly a round boat. Interesting hey.

Our evenings in Hampi on the other hand were relaxing (after climbing a rock formed hill) and admiring the sunset (a must while here) or enjoying a beer and delicious curry meal from one of the roof top restaurants, chatting away to both Indian and International travellers here.

Before finishing this blog we will share a story that stayed with us. One we found out about by talking with a local about his life. After talking for some time, he shared with us that both of his parents had sadly passed away to cancer when he was just a child leaving him and his siblings to fend for themselves. Although he has grown up and has now left his home town he continues to support his younger siblings in education.
Cycling across hampi
What really surprised us when talking to him was that although he has managed to forge a way of life for himself and even his siblings, he will always be disadvantaged on one aspect of his life. Marriage. He is 25, the age many men and women start to really settle down here. His friends have already found wives.

However as it is common practice for parents to find suitable partners for you here in India, he is not deemed suitable by many potential women and their parents due to a lack of parental line. He is however on the look out though so hopefully he'll be able to overcome this hurdle in his life.

Children in orphanages face the same challenges although many orphanages do play a parental role when it comes to this to help their children and young adults move on. Really harrowing. Never even considered this possibility when thinking about arranged marriages.

Gokak Water Falls
It is dry and barren because of drought in North Karnataka (Adverse impact of global warming)
People who love to travel, keep their eyes and ears open for every opportunity. His/her friends know it all. So when my friend bought a brand new car and planned to travel to his hometown for his baby’s naming ceremony, I got an invitation to travel with him.

I started early from office so that we could reach his home. Along the way, we picked up his cousin and hit the toll road of national highway. We were travelling from Bangalore to Gokak via Dharwad which was about 500 kms. The roads were good and we hit 100km/hr. on an average. There were not many private vehicles. My friend was keen to reach early before it gets dark. Starting at 2pm IST (Indian Standard Time) from Bangalore, it was simply impossible to do so.

We spoke about family, office and work. The green scenery of paddy, sugar cane and corn was pleasing to the eye. The weather was turning hot as we moved north. I attacked the muffins, the corn chips and water. We tasted some delicious homemade laddoos.

Gokak is small town built by the river Ghataprabha on the leeward side of the Western Ghats. It has

one of first cotton mills set up by British. It uses hydro-electric power generated by the magnificent Gokak falls (Niagara of India). As the south west monsoons had failed this year, there was hardly any water. The rocks showed their bareness and sorrow. There was an ancient temple built by the Chalukya’s dynasty at least 500 years ago close to Gokak falls. Next to the falls, there is Gokak Cotton Mill estate with its own bungalows, staff quarters, social club, school, swimming pool, badminton court etc. It appeared to have been constructed by the British to take care of its employees. There is a hanging bridge over the water falls which allows workers from other villages to cross and come to work in the mill. Later we visited another temple at a slightly higher elevation. It was inhabited mostly by monkeys and a few priests. We visited the local town temple. After a lovely dinner at Gokak resort, we rested.

On the way to Dharwad, we bought some fresh regional sweets called Kunda (famous in Belgaum) and Kadardant (popular sweet of Gokak). Dharwad is a university town with many horticulture universities. It is also called the pension town of

Karnataka. Many academicians, intellectuals, artists and scholars including Gyanpeeth awardees settle in this place. At the naming ceremony of my friend’s daughter, only female family members (no males!) lovingly decorated the baby’s cradle with flowers and balloons. The baby was gently rocked in cradle and the names of goddesses were whispered in her ears by her aunts. The women sang lullabies and the baby, Aarohi slept off peacefully. We had a sumptuous lunch and hit the road to return to Bangalore.

In this trip, I learnt that people fight over petty things and associate bad luck with certain plants and animals. Perhaps, they are insecure, afraid and find blaming a plant a solution to problems. Also, with Re1/kilo rice that is being distributed by the government, people perhaps are not motivated to work and have a lot of idle time to cultivate fancy superstitions. I realized the bad effect of not having a purpose in life; to do something meaningful with time. The full moon in the sky seemed to wink at me in silent agreement. I was home.

Jungle Walk
Mudumalai Tiger Reserve
Dear All

Greetings from Mysore, in the Indian state of Karnataka. Just arrived here a few hours ago, and other than saying this just seems so far the most comfortable, swankiest hotel I’ve stayed in so far, I will save writing about my time here until my next. The reason is I think there is plenty to relate already about these last few days, and I will add my afternoon in Mysore on to my next blog entry.

So last up, I believe I had just arrived in Ooty, at the most unusual Mount View Heritage Hotel, wonderful faded colonial grandeur with absolutely zippo on the service-front. It’s a shame, as I think they could do so much for the place if they spruced it up a bit and added a few friendly faces, what with its stunning rooms and top-notch view over Ooty. Still, if they had done that, then it would have been way out of my price range...! I had a unique stay in the hotel, and indeed these last few days have been quite different to anything I had experienced previously in India. These were days of relative peace, away from the hustle and bustle
The Black Bear Family Close-Up
of India, cool temperatures with no need for air-conditioning, and a glimpse into the more natural side of India. At the same time, they have been a bit unusual in being off-the-beaten track, with barely another tourist in sight, and travelling around has been a little bit trickier. It does feel good now to be back on the tourist trail once again though, but nevertheless, I have had a fascinating few days indeed, and here I will tell more.

First off, I have to admit that in the Mount View Hotel, when evening came, my excitement at being in the largest room I think I’ve ever stayed in, with its antique furniture seemingly dating back to the colonial days, seemed to fade away with the light. The lodge is at the end of a 200 metre dirt driveway from the main road, with no lighting along it whatsoever, making for a very spooky walk to the nearby resort hotel for dinner and back again. But my first night there was even spookier. I had not thought, upon checking in during the light of day, that the place might be haunted, but as dusk approached I could think of nothing
Gaur, or Indian Bison
After squaring us off, this buffalo stood to the side to let us pass in our jeep. As we passed, we only then saw the other buffalo hidden in the bushes to the left getting read to charge us - jumping around in a circle and snorting like crazy. Very very scary...
else. For the first time since sometime in my childhood, I had to sleep with the lights on! And even then it was a light sleep, as I kept waking up every couple of hours or so to check that there was nothing there in the room with me. All that stared back at me was the smile of a traditionally-dressed Indian girl in the one painting, eerily hanging over the fireplace. It’s amazing what tricks the mind plays on you when night falls in a place like that, and I was glad when the dawn came again the next morning. My second night was a bit easier there, and I could make do with sleeping with only one light in the vestibule area on. There also checked in two other foreign travellers in the room opposite me, both from the North of England, and the gentleman actually being the Headmaster of a private school in Sheffield, not far from where I grew up – what a small world! The fact that I was not so alone in the hotel did make the second night a bit easier to sleep through.

Perhaps it was this first night of light

sleep, or the fact of rising to an altitude of 2500 metres so quickly, that my second day in Ooty was pretty drab and perhaps the first naff day I’ve had travelling. Still, one naff day compared to twenty fantastic ones is a good ratio to my mind, and it all adds to the experience. My first day in Ooty I had gone straight on a hike out of town, but my second I thought it might be nice to wander around town and see a few of the touristy sights, this being a tourist town after all. It was interesting to take in Ooty’s beautiful lake, marred by a serious fun-fair type of atmosphere and hundreds of vehicles and tourist minibuses, St Stephen’s Church built by the Brits in 1829 and housing a number of fascinating tombs and gravestones of many a British colonial army officer and his family, and the central area of town centering around the main junction known as Charing Cross. Lunch was also taken at the plush Savoy Hotel, and dinner at Domino’s Pizzas (more Western comforts…!), but I couldn’t help thinking I might have had a better day had I arranged a day excursion
Udagamandalam (aka Ooty) Train Station

somehow into the beautiful highland areas out of town, home to stunning lakes, forested peaks and traditional tribal villages. Ah well, not to worry. The day was interesting at least, and it was still a refreshing change being up in the mountains.

But these last two days have been just incredible, and as soon as I descended from the upland Nilgiri Hills area, I felt uplifted again (perhaps, then, it was the altitude…?). Taking a taxi from Ooty to a tiny forest outpost called Singara around 30km away took me down from the hills again, down the even more spectacular Sighur Ghat road. The road comprises 36 hairpin bends, and as soon as it left the upper plateau area around Ooty, there were spectacular jungle wilderness vistas as far as the eye could see. The lower the road took us, the more the sounds of the Indian Jungle took over, and I realised that this was going to be a very special couple of days. I just have to briefly mention two more of the memorable signs glimpsed down the mountain road. On every hairpin bend, there was an advertisement for an ambulance company reading “For a free ambulance,
""Charing Cross""
The name given to the main junction of Ooty
call…”. On just one of them, there was a sign that read “For a free mortuary van, call…”. I have yet to decide whether this was as a joke, or was deadly serious. Was it also for the dangerous road which negotiated extremely steep valley sides, or was it for the dangerous animals which inhabit the jungle? I am still uncertain. Indeed, stopping for a quick toilet break, a monkey tried to get inside the taxi but fortunately I had rolled the window up. Monkeys initially look cute, but when they bare their fangs you realise just how nasty they can be. And then a few minutes later after driving again, an elephant crossed the road merely metres in front of us! This was actually really quite scary, it just came out of nowhere, and then disappeared again as soon as it had crossed, before I had chance to grab my camera, or even to say “elephant!”. It was just huge, a male elephant – contrary to African elephants where both sexes have tusks, it is only the male Indian elephant which has them, females don’t, and for this reason the male is also called a “Tusker”. This was certainly
Ah, the Cow Chilling Out in the Street!!
Been looking for one of these for a long time...!
a huge Tusker, and my first sighting of an Indian elephant in the wild. Very exciting indeed!

The taxi driver dropped me off in the jungle outpost “town”, or huddle of shacks, called Singara, at the edge of the tarmacked road, and already deep in the heart of the Mudumalai Tiger Reserve. Mudumalai is only part of a huge protected area called the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve, comprising Mudumalai in Tamil Nadu, Bandipur and Nagarhole in Karnataka, and Wayanad in Kerala, UNESCO protected and said to be one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots. It also has one of the best chances in India of spotting the ever-elusive tiger in the wild, with Mudumalai being home to around 50 of them, the highest population density in the whole of India. So I was certainly hoping to see a tiger during my visit, and this was one of the main reasons I included it on my itinerary. At Singara, the owner of the lodge I had booked into, The Wilds at Northernhay, met me in a 4x4 jeep and drove me the final two kilometres to the lodge, along the bumpiest road I think I have ever experienced.

My goodness what
Mount View Heritage Hotel Entrance
Rather foreboding...?!
a lodge! Straight out of a romantic safari-based novel, The Wilds at Northernhay is based in a(nother!) former British colonial bungalow, and also doubles up as a coffee plantation. I had booked myself into the lodge’s stunningly sited Tree House, about ten metres up a huge tree away from the main building, with stunning, unparalleled views over the Indian Jungle. This place was straight out of the Jungle Book, and the first time I have ever been in proper jungle. It was different to the rainforest type of “jungle” which I have experienced in South America, Africa and South-east Asia, though I can’t really explain how – I guess the trees were not so tall, more spread out, and the undergrowth bush was much more dense. I could never really describe the rainforest as a jungle for some reason, but this place I could. I just spent my first couple of hours there on my Tree House balcony, just staring out at the beauty of the landscape, and wallowing in the wondrous sounds of the wild – the exotic birds singing, insects chirruping and monkeys howling, along with various other sounds in the background, particularly at night, which I have

Spooky corridor...
no idea where, or what, they came from. This was just pure, how can I put it, jungle…!

I was also amazingly enough the only guest there for my two-night stay. The morning I arrived, a group of 12 had just left, and after I left this morning, they had five rooms booked up in total for the same evening. But for these two nights, I had the entire place to myself. The owner actually said I could have any of the rooms for the same price (still, not cheap – I consider it my “splurge” during this trip!), including the luxury suite with its two bedrooms, sitting room, and bathroom (with a bath!), or I could stay in one room one night and switch to another the other night. This was very tempting, as they had a good choice of interesting rooms, including along with the suite a separate cottage, and a traditional mud-built, but still luxury, hut. However, I was most satisfied with the Tree House. Even though it sloped slightly, and even though it creaked all night, and even moved when it became windy, I felt like a little boy again up there in the trees!
Me
Sorry, I just think this is really quite a cool picture...! Taken in the Mount View Heritage Hotel
A wonderful two nights were spent there, although the second night proved a bit troublesome to sleep again, as just as I was dropping off there came an almighty scuttling sound from the roof, and then in the bathroom. When I checked, a chocolate wrapper I had just put in the bin by the washbasin was lying in the middle of the bathroom floor. I believe it was a monkey that had somehow entered through the gap between a tree trunk and the ceiling, so again I slept with the bathroom light on and with one eye open… I also packed everything into my bags again before I went back to bed, as monkeys have also been known to take valuables such as mobile phones, and goodness knows what I’d do if one took my money belt. After a short while though, I did enter a deep sleep, and woke up the next morning with everything still there, which was a relief. Still, another night in which I was glad to see the dawn…!

Anyway, I fail yet to mention the amazing safaris I did from the lodge. The first evening, after a visit to the local (domesticated) elephant
Ooty Lake
camp, I was taken to a place to the north along a tarmacked road, but still prime viewing area for wildlife. Spotted some beautiful beasts, including a herd of elephants hidden deep in the bush, chital (or spotted) deer, wild boar, peacocks, and my favourite for the evening: a small family of black bears, with a little cub riding an adult piggy back – very cute! A very rare sight apparently, and along with tigers, leopards and black panthers, one of the “Big Four” to spot there. Unfortunately the family disappeared very quickly, before I had chance to take a good photo – still, I include a blurry one that I took anyway, as it was such a great sighting!

My second day I had to wait a bit to see if it was possible to go on a “nature walk” as well as another evening safari, as it had been raining pretty much ever since I got there and including through the night. This made the area around the lodge, being untarmacked and undeveloped, very muddy indeed. I was told it would be unsafe to do either a walk or a safari when it is muddy, because if
Ooty Lake
you have to run then you would most likely slip, fall over, and then…?! I was disappointed with the rain, but certainly didn’t want to find myself having to run away from something only to fall face down into a muddy pool and have the thing catch up with me. Also, safaris here were very different to what I had done in Africa. In Africa, the land was just so open wide, the wildlife was comparatively very easy to spot, and was also easy to drive away from quickly as you can just generally drive in any direction. Around the lodge, however, there was thick and dense jungle, criss-crossed by very muddy, very bumpy dirt tracks, which you can hope to travel along at an average speed of around 5mph. I wasn’t too sure of wishing to encounter something big and dangerous when the driver couldn’t get away too quickly, so when the rain did stop and we were given the go ahead I was most nervous to be honest.

On the morning of the second day, I went with one of the employees called Babbu on a nature walk around the lodge, asking in particular to see trees,
Ooty Lake
plants and butterflies, rather than tigers, leopards and elephants, due to our travelling on foot (though I guess you don’t really get much choice out there…!). Another different thing about safaris in India compared with Africa is that the guides are not allowed to carry guns, they are prohibited in India. So, I must say I was rather nervous during our hour’s walk through the coffee plantation, but fortunately the only animals we did see were a spectacular group of at least a hundred chital, or spotted deer, and a family of langur, or Hanuman (black-faced) monkeys. And after a wonderful rest of the day chilling around the lodge all to myself, and on my Tree House balcony with the spectacular view, it had stopped raining and I was able to take the evening jeep safari around the muddy tracks of the plantation. Within five minutes we had made our first sighting, a gaur, or Indian bison. This was stood on the track ahead of us, facing us, and I was told it was male and showing signs of aggression. This is a massive beast, with huge horns which have very sharp points, definitely not something you want to get
Having Fun at the Fair!
Ooty Lake
on the wrong side of. After a while, it backed down and stood to the side, so the driver decided that then was the time to drive past it. It was only upon approaching it that we realised and saw that there was one more even more aggressive-looking male hiding in the bushes to the side just metres to the left of us, and as we passed it began to jump and toss itself in a circle, making very loud snorting noises. This was very very scary, I did not enjoy it at all, and the time it took the 5mph jeep to pass this snorting beast and its companion, both ready to charge at any minute, seemed to last forever. My goodness it was such a relief to pass by safely, and to be honest I was most thankful that for the rest of the safari we were only able to spot one male, antlered chital deer standing very peacefully on the side of the track, generally minding its own business. That was just about enough excitement for one evening for me. Unfortunately my viewing of a tiger in the wild will have to wait for another time. We

Ooty
at least did see tiger paw prints, apparently only an hour old or so. When we got back, I realised we had pretty much done the safari in the area that we had walked on on foot (without any kind of weaponry protection) that very same morning. Wow. Perhaps I’m getting old, perhaps I’ve an overly vivid imagination, or perhaps I watched the “tiger attacks man on elephant” video on YouTube too many times before coming to India, but I think I feared the safaris at the time more than I enjoyed them. I do enjoy reminiscing on them now, however.

Anyway, and overall, an amazing two days spent in the jungle. This morning I said goodbye to my Tree House which had been home for two nights, and caught a bus to my third and final Indian state during my travels, Karnataka. In a place called Mysore to be exact, in the most wonderful and comfortable hotel with an array of fantastic hotel freebies including talc, matchsticks, “skin jelly” and a superb souvenir bottle-opener/key-ring (which I shall be using very shortly to help me open my newly-arrived, from room service, large bottle of Strong Kingfisher beer!). Still, I

The tombs and gravestones of British colonials
will save writing about my time in Mysore so far until my next one.

For now, I sign out, after some very enjoyable, often quirky, days of travel off-the-beaten tourist track in Southern India. I spend two nights here in Mysore, before moving on to Bangalore on Friday, and back home on Sunday to arrive at Gatwick late Sunday evening. I will most likely write once more, to conclude my trip, on Monday, from the comfort of my very own spare bedroom in my beautiful little house in Croydon. No doubt after having unpacked, stuck everything in the wash, had a beer or two, and a long, stinkingly hot bath J

So, until then, thanks for reading, and bye for now!

All the best

Roaring sea Gokarna
Karnataka boasts no. of splendid waterfalls situated in various spots of Western Ghat Region. Best time to enjoy the waterfalls is during monsoon. Last week the news of monsoon spreading towards Coastal Karnataka was highlighted in various media channels. We were in two minds, whether this would be the right time to visit that region, particularly by road. Ultimately, last Friday (19thJune, 2015) late evening,we made up our minds and booked on line accommodation in Jog Falls.



Day 1 - 20th June, 2015

Way to Jog Falls

Next day myself along with my wife and son started in our Car towards JOG FALLs. It is one of the highest waterfall in India (around 900ft) located around 400 KMs from Bangalore.Our destination was Hotel MayuraGerusoppaJogfalls of Karnataka Tourism. We started a bit late (around 6.15 AM) since the program was made suddenly and without much planning. After filling petrol when we reached near Yeshwantpur it was past seven.My wife helped to navigate me with “Google” and GPS in hand. My son joined the navigation occasionally.

Route Bangalore to Chitradurga

Our route plan was to reach near Chitradurga via NH 4 (Bangalore Mumbai Highway) then take
On the way to Jog Falls
left turn towards Shimoga thru NH 13 (Sholapur Mangalore Highway)and finally take NH 206 (Bangalore – Honnavar Highway) to reach Jog Falls via Sagar.

From Yaswantpurupto near Neelamangala there was morning traffic. After crossing the second Toll Gate (Rs 18, First Toll gate we paid Rs 20), no of vehicles considerably reduced and we could drive fast. It was a pleasure to drive through NH4, which was a four lane Highway and well maintained.

After reaching Sira (8.35 AM) thru Tumkur, followed by Patterhalli (8.55 AM) and Hiriyur (9 AM), we reached our first destination near Chitradurga(9.30 AM) where we took left turn after a lake and enter NH 13 (Sholapur Mangalore Highway). On the way there were hundreds of Windmills installed in the hilltop which provided a nice view.

Weather was cloudy with small showers in between.

Chitradurga to Shimoga

Felt hungry and finished breakfast at a roadside hotel immediately after Chitradurga town(10 AM). This area was surrounded by small hills with big boulders, no vegetation.

Road condition of NH 13 was not at all conducive for smooth driving. The road was getting broadened (two lane) for which construction work was going on
Jog Falls with dark cloud
at various places. Road materials mixed with rainwater made matters worse. Above all the road was broken in some places. Negotiating all these,when we reached Chennagiri (11AM) and Shimoga(12 AM) crossing Tunga River, already the car was very dirty with wheels and lower part becoming red mingled with debris.

Stopped at TungaRiver to decide the next destination. Crossing two three circles, few Medical Colleges finally touched NH 206 (Honnavar Highway). This road although not very broad but was well maintained.

From Shimoga to Sagar was around 90 Kms. Thereafter we entered a sanctuary. Forest started. Now the scenario changed. Hilly tracks, in between villages. We saw a big village market on the road including Fish market also.

Rain,Rain,Rain

After that, rain started. Incessant rain, as if the whole sky was releasing its deposits on our car and on the road. Car wiper at its maximum speed, Windscreen flooded with waterflow, only the sound of rain on all sides.

It was thrilling, may be risky, but we came to see this.

Entering Jog Falls

We pierced the rain and entered our ultimate destination for the day, JOG FALLs crossing Saravatiriver at around 2 PM(425
Mystic Jog
Kms from Bangalore, 106 Kms from Shimoga,26 Km from Sagar).

Hotel Mayura Gerusoppa Jog falls, Karanataka Tourism was well maintained. I came here around ten years back. It was renovated. Inside room was cosy and spacious. Most important,the falls were just in front of the hotel. Nice location to enjoy the waterfall. No private hotel was allowed adjacent to that area.

To our surprise we saw large no. of visitors who came by Bus, Trekker, Tata Sumo, Hired vehicle and of course private vehicles. These enthusiastic people enjoyed getting soaked by rain and of course the view of waterfalls.

Last time we went to the foothills (around 900ft) where the waterfall touched the Saravatiriver. But now the walkway was closed due to some accident. Thus it was better to enjoy from the top.

Lunch was not expected, but it was available even at around 3 PM at KSTDC Restaurant. Not very tasty, but there was no other option also.

Meanwhile the weather improved, the white lines became visible. We thought of visiting the other side of the river to have different view of the falls.

Two districts of Karnataka (Shimoga and Karwar) are separated
Fourth Source of Jog Falls
by the river. KSTDC Hotels where we were staying was on Shimoga District, while on other side of Karwar district only Government Inspection Bunglow and some private shops were located. Then we visitedthat area.

View of the falls was better from that side. Moreover there was walkway to go down to a certain extent. However it is risky since not fenced unlike from the Shimoga phase.

Intensity of rain increased again when we reached there. In spite of that there were lot of tourists.We spent there as long as there was day light . Had tea and small chat with shop-owner, then came back to Hotel.

Dinner we had in a nearby stall with fish curry. Night sleep was enjoyable with sound of the waterfall.

Day 2 - 21st June, 2015

Morning started with heavy rain. Falls were mostly not visible. The contest between “cloud” and the “waterfall” was in full swing. We thought of starting early but “late-latif” as usual.

After breakfast at KSTDC restaurant we bagan our journey towards Honnavar thru NH 206 and ultimately to Murudeswar.Meanwhile dark clouds covered almost entire place including Hotel area. Hardly anything was visible.

Murudeswar
View from the public balcony
was around 80 Kms from Jog Falls, Honnavaren-route was around 50 Kms. NH 206 which goes to Honnavarwas narrow but road condition was more or less ok. Honnavar is located on the Arabian Sea coast.We had to cross the Western Ghatmountains to reach our destination.

Heavy Rain with storm at the Ghat Section

Immediately after crossing the Saravatyriver in Jog Falls, thick forest started. A few kilometres later Ghat Section road began. The road was zig zag with large no of curves and it neededcareful driving to negotiate. All those were known, but to our disadvantage, heavy rain started with stormy winds. Heavy fogs made visibility near to zero even with fog light. Falling trees in various places narrowed down the road passage. I switched on all the headlights of my car while proceeding slowly. Gradually, we reached the plain land after driving around 25 Kms on the Ghat section. It was a breath taking journey.

Honnavar

NH 206 touched NH 17 after going further down. NH 17 comes from Mumbai on the North and goes beyond Mangalore on the south. Honnavar is basically a fishing port located on the Arabian Sea. We stopped there for
Raja & Rani two separate sources outof four
a while. The two KM long Honnavar road bridge on the way to Murudeswar is one of the longest bridges in India. The bridge is constructed on the Sharavatiriver near the confluence of the Arabian sea. The backwater of the Arabian Sea gives a magnificent view of the whole place.



Murudeswar

Giant Lord Shiva Statute& Temple

This wonderful place is the abode of Lord Shiva and located on the coast of Arabian Sea. The giant Statute (122 Ft) of Lord Shiva, one of the tallest in the world was built on a big rock on the seashore. The area has other beautiful statutes and the temple.One can directly drive near the statute or visit by walk. The area is well planned and beautifully maintained. There are no of hotels in the vicinity. The entire place including hotels belong to a private RNShetty Group.

Murudeswar Temple

As per legend, this temple has the linkage of Ravanas worship to Lord Shiva to acquire Atma-linga (soul of Shiva) to gain immortality.He was unable to do so due to tricks by other gods like Lord Ganesha and Narada to save the universe. On his failure,Ravana threw his
Ghat section from Jog to Honnavar
belongings in anger to this place. Original temple was re-built by businessman R N Shetty.Gopuram of the temple was more than 20 storey tall, one of the tallest in the world. There is lift arrangement for reaching the top floor to have abirds eye view of the surrounding area.

Stay at Murudeswar

We reached Murudeswar at around 2 PM. There was no rain, but sea was very rough and roaring. We selected Hotel RNS Residency Hotel for staying. Location of the hotel was unique since it was constructed on an area which was extended to the sea. Thus almost three sides of the hotels were surrounded by the sea. It is one of the best location I have ever seen anywhere particularly for staying on sea-side.

The hotel tariff was low since it was off-season and very few visitors were occupying the rooms. We selected a sea-side room on the fifth floor. However, the flip side was absence of proper maintenance. Furnishing, cleaning of the hotel were not of that standard. But definitely a great feeling for one day experience.

Rest of the day spent by visiting the temple, Shiva Statute and surrounding places and enjoying
Ghat section from Jog to Honnavar 2
evening coffee in the wonderfully placed restaurant surrounded by sea. We were standing at the front-side of the hotel where roaring sea weaves just few feets below relentlessly attempting to break the cement structure with enormous energydue to inclement weather. Observing from the hotel balcony that tonnes of water waves dashingbeneath the hotel structure in roaring defiance of destruction was a frightening but worth experiencing. Also viewing the sea at night from the hotel balcony was a memorable experience.

Day 3 - 22nd June, 2014

Way to Gokarna

Time for returning to Bangalore. Complimentary breakfast time of the hotel was 7.30 AM onwards. Previous night we thought of starting immediately after taking breakfast. But after finishing breakfast and check out formalities when we started it was around 8.45 AM, already one hour late from our schedule.

Weather was far better today. After expressing its anger, Sea was calm and cool today. Offered “pranaam” to Lord Shiva and our journey began.

We were in two minds whether to visit Gokarna, but my wife insisted that we should not miss it. For Gokarna, the route was same uptoHonnavar. Distance between Murudeswar and Gokarna is around 80 Km
Lord Shiva statue Murudeswar
thru NH 17. This road was quite good to drive with wonderful natural beauties on the way. After crossing Honnavar, Gangavalli river was giving us company on her voyage to sea. The river was in spate,a splendid view to watch on the way.

Gokarna is a small town, but we thought of visiting “Om Beach” first, which was around 20 Kms from the main highway, around half an hour journey. It was a pleasant journey with the narrow road gradually increasing in height havingseveral twists and turns. Around four Km away from the beach we had the first glimpse of the sea from the top. Sea and the beach were located around 200 ft down below, amidst hills in the surroundings. An excellent panoramic view to enjoy. Gradually we came nearer with Resorts and Cottages in between. The beach looked like “OM” from the top, a spectacular sight. It was around 11 AM.

We stopped the car and trekked down below to the beach. This beach was different with rocky areas in various places. Sea was once again looking furious with mighty waves falling on the rocks. It was wonderful to watch the big waves and beauty of
Om Beach Gokarna
the beach.

MahabaleshwarTemple,Gokarna

The Mahabaleswar Temple, Gokarna of Lord Shiva was auspicious and a must visit. The Atmalinga or Shiva linga is said to bestow immense blessings to the devotees who took even aglimpse of it. According to mythology, the deity was placed by Ravana when he carried it from Mount Kailash. The temple according to legend was originally built more than thousand years ago and subsequently re-built during Vijaynagara period. The temple is claimed to be as pious as the Shiva Temple of Varanasi.

Gents visitors have to remove theirbanian to enter the temple.Luckily there was no rush, we visited the Lord, collected Prasad.

Return to Bangalore

Now we had to start at the earliest for reaching Bangalore within the day. According to Google map, there were no. of routes for going back to Bangalore. I wanted to take the same route thru which we came here.But the map showed a different preferred route for reaching early. With some hesitation we decided to take that route . The distance to be covered was around 600 Kms. It was 12.30 PM.

NH 63 thru Yellapur,Mundgod and Bankapur

We took left turn thru NH
Om Beach Gokarna 2
17 for around twenty kms further down towards Karwar. Thentook a right turn to reach NH 63 towards Yellapur. Reached Yellapur at 2.30 PM. The road passed thru absolutely green forests in Western Ghat with occasional view of waterfalls from nearby hills. There were some risky turns but overall road condition was good. There was not much traffic en-route. We passed around 60 Kms thru forest&Ghat section like these.

Throughout our journey the “Google Map” followed thru GPS dictated us which route to take as well as the distances to be covered. Suddenly we observed that there was not enough “Charge” in our mobile. We forgot to charge our mobile last night. That was a big mistake. We had bought a charger to recharge the mobile from the Car itself. But when we needed it most, we found out that it was not working. So the immediate requirement was to conserve the charge remaining in the mobile as much as possible.

Reached Mundgod and observed Tibetan Monasteries, villagers and their habitats on the way. We love Tibetan food but there was no time to search for eateries.

Our immediate objective was to touch NH 4 near Bankapur.
Raja, Rani, Rocket Jog Falls
Unfortunately,near Bankapur we lost the way and erroneously entered a remote village road with large potholes. That was a nightmare and I waspraying that our car would somehow pass that road (around five kms) without any trouble.

Bankapur-Haveri to Bangalore (NH 4)

At last, near Bankapur we reached NH 4 with a sigh of relief. We had crossed around 200 Kms already. There will be another nearly 400 Kmsdrive to reach Bangalore. It was around 4 PM.

Immediately, there was a Toll gate atBankapur (Rs. 70/-). Afterwords, we passed at least 5 Toll gates (RanebennurRs 95/-,HebbaluRs 75/-, GuilaluRs 55/-,TumkurRs 18/-, NeelamangalaRs 18/-). In many tollgates they ask for exact change and then return one rupee less in absence of change. But had no regets, since we could cover around 375 Kms within four hours with one stop in between. As I explained NH4 is one of the best roads to drive. Around 8.15PM we passedYashvantpurRailway station and reached home at around 9 PM.

We drove around 1200 KM in three days. In between we passed dense forests, huge waterfalls, mighty rivers, twists and turns of Ghat Roads. We offered prayers in temples. We enjoyed vast
Raja, Rani, Rocket Jog Falls 2
areas of Western Ghat range and Coastal Karnataka. Above all we experienced rain and Monsoon.

A memorable journey indeed.

May 12th 2015
Published: May 12th 2015


I’ve been back on the land for two weeks and all kinds of things have happened since, but let me use this post to explain the few weeks I spent at Auroville.

After a few more days with the Auroville guys, I left with Ilango and Vikram in the Bolero with all their gear and we drove to Auroville in 10 hours. The trip was mostly uneventful as we listened to a broken Bob Marley cd with the two main highlights being another twister passing us on the road and a very, very tight descent down the mountains with 27 needle pin bends.

We arrived at the AV youth centre in the evening. The first few days there were kind of boring to me but then I decided to go out and explore on my own. Mostaba let me use his bicycle the entire time (thanks so much!) so I was able to go out whenever I wanted. I checked out the visitors centre first and got a very different impression of the place than I’d had from just being in the YC the first few days

In brief, Auroville is a town of over 2000 people that was started in 1968, based upon the idea of human unity, as described by two somewhat mysterious (or perhaps mythical) persons generally referred to as ‘The Mother’ and Sri Aurobindo. As such, there are a lot of people from all over the world (especially many Europeans) who have contributed to the place and have basically built a life for themselves. At the centre of Auroville there is a huge golden globe, called The Matrimandir, which is the symbol of Auroville and is a place used for tourguides and meditation. I guess occasionally ceremonies and things of such nature are held in or around as well, though I didn’t get to see any. Inside the matrimandir it looks and feels like a 70’s sci-fi movie. You have to wear white socks in order to keep the carpeted spiral walkway up to the inner chamber pristinely white. Inside the inner chamber is a huge crystal ball, and underneath the entire thing is a smaller crystal ball, surrounded by marble slabs with water flowing over them. I found it all both beautiful and absurd.

I actually kinda knew about a lot of this before coming to India as I had been referred to AV as a potential place for my placement, but the impression I’d gotten through various online sources made me think it was either a tourist destination or a place for seriously floaty people. Plus they didn’t reply to my second email... At any rate, I can say that my assumptions were misplaced and I’m very glad to have been able to go there for a short while anyway. In fact, I highly recommend anyone to visit and learn about an alternative way to life (it is apparently the world’s largest eco-village) and I think I would have really enjoyed interning at one of their permaculture/reforestation projects. There are literally all kinds of people there, including many volunteers and travellers passing through, even outside of the tourist season.

The first two weeks I still hung out mostly at the youth centre. It’s actually one of the most unlikely parts of AV. Although mostly inhabited and visited by Aurovillan teenagers, there were 3 other visitors staying there at the same time I was. The rent is cheap (200 rps plus some volunteer work per day) and so I worked a bit now and then on digging a pool, building a treehouse and a gameroom, together with various of the AV gang, as well as some European travellers (Aemon, Alex & Mihael). Every Saturday they have a Farmer’s Market and a Pizza Night at YC which attract all kinds of people. The first time I met some people volunteering at Buddha Garden who invited me to join them the following Monday. I also met some Norwegian students who study at a Norwegian university in Pondicherry and eventually went with them to a party there.

At Buddha Garden I met several of the people who had invited me, but I also met quite a few others. These people seemed far more interested in sharing stories with me and as time went on at AV the group seemed to grow larger as people mingled with one another and got more familiar with the area. I felt relieved to have found people who were in a somewhat similar place as me and could therefore connect with. I spent some days hanging out with various crowds, doing some work at the youth centre, exploring the area, visiting a permaculture farm called Solitude (where they host concerts and offer meals cooked with a lot of their own vegetables), the Matrimandir and so on. There was also a big meeting (about 200 attendees) I attended where people discussed the issue of building a road through a place called Pony Farm. Basically there is a masterplan for Auroville’s development, which doesn’t seem to take into account the community of people already living there. It was very interesting to see how the whole meeting was set up and I thought the facilitator did a great job of giving everyone a chance to talk. Unfortunately I was unable to visit Pony Farm.

Then on Friday I met up with Lev and Lucie to go to the Pebble Garden tour. Since I was the only one on a bicycle I quickly had to learn how to drive a TVS (a small scooter with no gears) which was no problem. The tour was really great! Basically Pebble Garden is one of several reforestation projects that have been going on at and around Auroville in the past 20-30 years. The main person, Bernard, is a very excited storyteller and explained the history of the place before we went out to have a look around. They use an interesting technique for their garden beds, mimicking the behaviour of termites to create nutrient-rich soil. I also learnt that the entire area used to be a forests, before the British and French cut down all the trees and the topsoil was washed away into the Bay of Bengal, turning the area into a desert. Thanks to the efforts of people like Bernard, Auroville is now a very forested area with lots of shade. The weather is a bit different than at Swayyam. It’s very humid and quite exhausting, especially with having to use a bicycle most of the time.

The next day I met up with some Buddha Garden people at one of the lodging areas, called Reve and met an American girl named Madi and everything changed. We went to a lake and things clicked so we hung out at the pizza night at the youth centre. After that we hung out every day and had amazing times together. I drove her TVS all over the place which was awesome until one night when we had way too many problems with getting several TVS’s to start. After that night I couldn’t help but feel sad at the thought that it would all be over soon, but this prompted me to make the most of our last few days and change my attitude. We drove to Pondicherry the next day and had a great time, taking rickshaws and walking around the Botanical Gardens (featured briefly in The Life Of Pi) before getting my busticket for the coming Saturday. It’s really helpful to have someone around who’s more familiar with the way things work in India (haggling with the rickshaw drivers especially).

The next Friday I visited Pebble Garden again to get some seeds from Bernard for Malvikaa and after that I went with Paul (a German guy I met) to the Sadhana Forest tour. Sadhana Forest is an all-vegan reforestation/restoration project with over 1000 volunteers per year. I didn't like the tour as much as Bernard’s but it was still good to see everything and afterwards there were several videos explaining their projects (also in Kenya, Haiti and another location in India) and then we watched the first part of a documentary on all kinds of issues mankind is experiencing nowadays. It was inspiring but tiring. Afterwards we went to Brother’s Pizza place where we met up with Madi and Cris.



The last day I hung out with Madi before the taxi showed up at the Youth Centre to take me away to the Pondicherry bus station. Reluctantly I got in after saying my goodbyes. The bus left at 11pm to arrive at Bangalore around 6am the next day. It was a bumpy ride and the guy next to me kept nodding off on my shoulder. Needless to say, I didn’t sleep much. When I got to Bangalore I tried to get a rickshaw driver to take me to the train station so I could get to Mysore the way Madi had advised, but instead he argued I should take a taxi. I was tired and in no mood to argue so I figured I would check out how much it would be. 150 rupees to get to Mysore is not a whole lot of money so I took the taxi (which fit 10 people) and got to Mysore about 3 hours later. I thought of doing some sight-seeing in Mysore but touristing with my house on my back and lack of sleep didn’t seem like a fun idea so instead I went to a hotel where they had wifi and I could charge my laptop and phone. They treated me like a special customer, even going so far as to tell the guy who was on the toilet to hurry up since I needed to go. I got to the bus station and then took a bus to Gundlupet and then to Yelachatti where I arrived around 4.30pm, feeling very alone. The land had gotten very green and beautiful though and it was clear I was in for the next stage of my stay in India.

On the Way
Wide empty road- can't imagine in the city.
Goa is a known name to Domestic and Overseas travelers. It has one of the finest beaches of India and many old age churches. The carefree and lively atmosphere, mouth watering Sea food delicacies, Casino parlors, Jewellery are some of the attractions.

Generally I do a kind of research when I visit any place. But when I visited Goa for the first time in April 2014, I had nothing to research before the visit. Because I might be the only first time visitor to the place among my known circle. In fact it was just a much awaited trip for my son.

So, to give a bit of excitement to the trip, we decided to drive down. So that we could stop wherever we wanted, could eat at our choice of eatery and could leisurely spend time on the roadside.

We started our journey at around 6am in the morning. It took one hour to cross the city including a railway crossing which itself took 30mins to cross.

It is always eye soothing to go out of the city; then only we can enjoy the real beauty of nature.

Bangalore is a city of lakes and
Greenery
Eye soothing view
greenery. We can see trees on both sides of the roads many times the top of the trees kissing each other making a complete shade over the busy roads, being having awesome weather throughout the year some trees are always laden with beautiful flowers. But the population, high rise buildings, pollution has shielded the natural beauty.

But, once we crossed the busiest and newly developed part of the city, we could see double storied traditional houses painted with bright yellow, blue and other colors separated by a patch of greenery from the neighboring house. There was breathing space for every house, many has small garden at the front.

As we further moved we could see houses with more open areas, temples. The temple of each state and region is uniquely different in India. In the southern states, the outer wall of the temple building also has different sizes idols built on it.

We stopped for breakfast at a famous south Indian food chain joint. We always prefer to have local cuisine. We were required to cover 12 hours journey hence, had quite heavy breakfast of Idli and Dosa.

Now we were quite out of the city
Masala Dosa
South Indian delicacy
and could see small hills, wind mills, power stations at the foothills, long stretch of dry fields. The memories of these natural beauty remains in the heart and mind for long and gives us enthusiasm to go back to our work of daily life and makes our wait sweet for the next venture.

We got out of our car, just to feel the freshness of air and see the beauty. We walked around, clicked photos, looked at the passers by and restarted after 15-20 mins.

By now we had crossed Bangalore and its outskirts; were passing small towns of Karnataka. Though there is a distinct difference between the two, but the small places we crossed looked quite prosperous in its own way of having cemented houses, TV and internet cables, local public transport etc..

We enjoyed every bit of it. Like temple, houses and its colour, local shops ambience, women’s accessories are also uniquely different of every state of India.

We crossed small towns, villages, long stretch of paddy fields, some empty stretches where neither crops nor people were seen, between two villages.

Then we reached to the forest area. It’s a long stretch mixture
Photo frame
Unscheduled halt
of good and bad roads. Small habitats are also there but less crowded. It’s the area along the western ghat and the forest is a deciduous one. It was early summer time, some trees have shredded their leaves, some has got new leaves. Altogether it was a beautiful view with a wide range of green shades. The sunlight was peeping through the gaps of trees mainly without the leaves one. We could see upto the depth of the forest through the trunks of the trees. We could see the boards “Drive slowly animals may cross the road,” There could be wild animals deep inside the jungle, might roam around on to the roads but during day time it would have been a rare sight. Still we all live with hope and we kept our hopes on. We had to content ourselves with one fox crossing the road.

Lunch time was approaching and our stomach started growling. We started hunting for the restaurant. Being forest area only with small villages we were not able to locate one though locals were directing us but not satisfying us. 45 minutes passed, no food joint found. We thought of stopping now, the first
Goa
Beach, Sky - sunset and a coconut tree
one we find. In between we saw one sweet lime juice seller. We satisfied ourselves with that.

Another 30 minutes gone, nothing was found. We were sure that we have to take lunch only after reaching Goa around 3pm. We diverted ourselves from this search. All of a sudden we saw a small hotel beside a shop. We stopped and ordered for Rice, Roti , Dal and Chicken Curry. It was a smallest joint I would ever had lunch at, but unbelievable taste of the food. Home grind-ed spices by traditional method, no adulteration, no short cut during preparation. As we say "" yummy "".The taste still lies on my taste buds. Same day dinner at Taj also could beat it.

We were so happy and satisfied after the lunch that we spent some time roaming around. We were almost reaching to the Goa state. Within an hour we crossed the forest area and reached Goa.

We will love to come back to Goa by this route again and obviously stop for the lunch there.

Hey everybody,

So it’s been almost 3 weeks since my first blog-post. By now I can say I’ve settled in quite nicely out here. Malvikaa left to the US a few days ago though she left the land last Sunday morning, so since then I’ve been ‘alone’ with the guys from Auroville. I hope to be travelling a little bit with them when they leave but it depends on whether there’s space in the cars.

Anyway, that’s all in the future. In the past so many days I’ve only been off the land twice – once to visit a local furniture maker who’s ‘factory’ is just down the road and another time to the town of Gundlupet to buy groceries. It’s good to be with some other white people who can show me how they do their everyday activities, since English isn’t actually that common around this area.

Most of my days have looked like this: I wake up in my tent around 5.30 and get out about 10 minutes later to go over to the house to switch off the electric fence so Nagappa can come in and bring fresh milk. Then I go back to bed and sleep until the heat forces me out again between 8 and 9am. I wash my clothes in a bucket and wash my bum with with my left hand, leaving the right available to eat with. I wash the rest of my body with a ‘bucket bath’, though perhaps this should be called a bucket shower since there’s no actual bathing in anything. Breakfast is around 9am, lunch usually 2pmish and dinner... 9pmish. At least that’s how it’s been the past week or so.

The work I do tends to involve a lot of water – watering plants, filling up tanks and barrels and curing cement. I’ve also helped the auroville guys a few times though, including making a treehouse (during which we saw a miniature tornado cruise through the land!) and doing various other things. Yesterday Philip helped me make ‘my first steps in natural building’. Literally, I made some steps with just sticks, rocks and soil from the bund down to where my tent is and I feel quite proud of it. Pics will have to come later though. Also, today I made cement!

I’ve also been working together with Nagappa and Nagesh, usually digging things or assisting the laying and connecting of water pipes. We recently finished installing the 5000 litre water tank though! This will make the whole land more resistant to anything that might go wrong, like the few days when we didn’t have much power so we couldn’t pump water and had to have Nagappa bring some drinking water from the village, just in case...

I’ve also just about read all of Brad Warner’s excellent book ‘There is no God and He is always with you’ (highly recommended, regardless of what your thoughts about God are, or aren’t) and been doing zazen almost daily, which has really helped me focus on being where I am. Especially the first 10 days or so I was experiencing some mood swings and missing some things about home, especially people and certain luxuries. But I feel much better now. Not to say I don’t miss hanging out with my friends back home and I spend quite a bit of time thinking about my band or what kind of cool things in Wageningen and Utrecht I’m missing out on!

But I also feel that being here is in line with what I want to be doing. Perhaps not forever, perhaps not in India, or the US, but I like the concepts of land restoration and permaculture and I’m noticing how much of a difference to the land (and to the people working on it) a place like Swayyam makes and how damn important it is that we all take better care of ourselves, each other and the environment (it’s all one thing really anyway).

So to add something ‘educational’ to this blogpost, here’s how I understand some of what’s happening here: There’s only a small amount of usable fresh water on the planet (less than 3%!,(MISSING) look up peak water) and in many places it’s used tremendously stupidly and a lot of it runs off into places we can’t reach it, it gets polluted, or it goes into the oceans where it becomes salt water and therefore not so useful to us humans, who depend on fresh water to survive (like many, if not all, other species). Desertification (the process by which a fertile piece of land degrades until there is only desert left) happens for a variety of reasons, not in the least because of humans causing deforestation (particularly for agricultural purposes, though also for instance to build fleets of ships in Europe, back in the 16th and 17th centuries and so on). Trees retain moisture deep in the soil, allowing water to stay in one place, feeding the micro-organisms in the soil and allowing other plants and animals and so on to live as well. So a major step in land restoration is to plant trees, which is why I carry so much water around to make sure all the planted saplings and things get to survive out here in the dry, dry sun. From about May til about July there will be lots of rain (the monsoon period) here and then it will be important to try to keep as much of the water as possible here on the land. For this there are also certain techniques, such as the building of swales, check dams and placing rocks lower than the plants and digging higher than the plants so as much of the water will stay around the plants as long as possible. It’s all a matter of designing things so that the natural occurrences will ‘automatically’ allow the area to restore itself.

So, that should also sorta explain the title of this blogpost. That and the fact that Neurosis are an amazing band and you should all check them out even though 95%!o(MISSING)f you will probably hate them. Oh well. Also check out Shrinebuilder, and Pelican, and The Pixies, and Dead Meadow and Sleep. All excellent desert music.

Kthxbai!

We have spent the past three days in Mysore. We toured the palace which was built in the early 1900's, and is absolutely beautiful. It is so opulent with colorful murals on the walls and high domed ceilings with carvings and paintings. At night the whole outside is lit up with thousands of lights.Will post some pictures, but unfortunately we were not allowed to take pictures inside.

As the saying goes, all good things must come to an end, so now our time in incredible India is done. Words cannot describe the experiences we have had. India is a country of contrasts, from richness and opulence to squaller and rubble. The people are warm and friendly, willing to help and always smiling. We have seen and experienced so much in our short time here, and yet there is so much more. I just may have to come back. Anybody want to come with me?

Thanks for reading and for the comments. See you all soon.

Ready to Ride
My car fitted with the new BnB bicycle rack
I recently re-discovered a childhood craze of mine. As a kid, I would literally beg anyone I could find with a cycle to lend it to me for a few minutes. Those were not the days of speciality kids cycles (or at least we could not afford one), so a lot of us would 'half pedal' on adult cycles - yes, the big black heavy ones. Since we did not have one in our house, any guest or neighbour who had one fell victim to my persistent pleading. Well, 30 years later, I can afford a much better cycle, and don't need to plead anyone any more. I makes me wonder why I did not re-start cycling earlier.

Anyway - I got myself a Schnell Jaguar 2.0 MTB about a month ago, and after a couple of 35-40 km rides over the last few weekends, on insistence of my good friend Tatha, we ventured to ride from Bangalore to Nandi hills, about 68 km from my house. Tatha has been cycling for about a year now, and had recently come back from a 130 km trip to Coorg. On the other hand, I had been cycling for only a month
Almost there.. that's my friend Tatha
and had no hill climbing experience whatsoever. Riding the first 60 km on largely flat good roads (with light slopes at times) seemed doable, but I was definitely unsure of the 8 km climb of about a 1000 m. I had read in some blogs that it was a moderately difficult climb (I had NO idea what that really meant - moderately difficult for whom ???), especially if one is cycling from Bangalore, and not just from the foothills. We'll never know till we try - so we set off one Sunday morning.

Note: This write-up is about my cycle ride to Nandi hills strictly from a beginner's point of view. During the week before the ride, I could not find a single entry which would tell a novice like me as to how difficult or easy would it be. Hopefully, this blog could help a first-timer.

The plan was this: We would start around 5:45 AM from our houses so that we meet around 6:30 AM at Hebbal (about 17 km from my house). We'll then ride to the foothills of Nandi hills, with a break for breakfast in between. After that, we'll try climbing as much
That's me.. almost at the top
as possible. Our wives and kids would join us in cars around 11 AM at Nandi hills, and we'll hitch a ride back. Our cars were fitted with brand new cycle racks for this purpose.

As usual (for me), I got almost no sleep the night before as I was too excited about the trip, and also worried that I wouldn't wake in time. After a lot of tossing and turning, I slept only at 3 AM to catch about 2 hours of disturbed sleep before getting up. A strong cup of strong freshly brewed black coffee and a cold shower meant I was feeling absolutely fresh - though I knew that the lack of sleep would take its toll at some point. Anyway - I was off by around 6:05 AM - 20 minutes behind schedule. A note on what I packed with me: A change of clothes, a lightweight cycle pump, about 1.5 l of water (half of it with Gatorade powder) and a couple of energy bars. Of course I had my cycling shorts (the bum-pads are God-sent !!), gloves and helmet on.

The first section of the ride (17 km, to Hebbal) was a
On the top... Conquered Nandi Betta
breeze. It was nice and cool - empty roads & ideal riding conditions. I made it to Hebbal by 6:45 AM. There I met Tatha, and after around 5 minutes of hamstring and calf muscle stretches, we set off. Riding along NH7 (we did not take the elevated highway) was super-smooth - though some cars & trucks coming on the wrong side was a major irritant. We kept up a good pace of around 28-30 kmph on the flat sections. We planned to have breakfast at the McDonalds just before BIAL, but found it closed when we reached there around 7:40 AM. Damn !! Anyway - we rode on, and just before turning of NH7 towards Nandi Hills, we found a new 'parantha joint'. Being pretty hungry by that time, we devoured a couple of large stuffed paranthas along with a nice cup of steaming hot tea. Well - that was a mistake - as we soon found out. A 'kinda-obvious-on-hindsight' tip to anyone trying this for the first time: Getting enough calories is necessary for a trip like this, however, getting them from oil-soaked aloo paranthas is a BAD idea !!

It took us around 30 minutes to
yep.... !!!
finish breakfast - we got started and soon took the left turn on Nandi hills road. We had about 15 kms to go till the foothills, and the road was lovely (with gentle up and down slopes). This is when we started realizing our folly - it was REALLY difficult to cycle hard with oily food stuffed in our tummies. The 15 kilos of extra weight that I always carry on my self didn't help matters either!! Yet - we were still high on enthusiasm, and reached the foothills just before 9:30 AM - on time with our original schedule. Less than 3.5 hours for 60 km, including a couple of small breaks and 1 longish breakfast stop. Not bad, we thought. We realised at the same time that the real test lay ahead. I had already cycled the maximum I had ever done in my life in a single day.

After about 15 minutes of rest, we got started for the uphill ride. For a novice like me, and with tired legs, it was tough. Period. I somehow got through the first 1 km - thinking all the time 'how soon till I give up'. Tatha, despite a
The downhill Ride was AMAZING...
nagging knee pain, kept up the pace ahead of me, and at times stopped to let me catch up. After about 2-3 km, I started feeling a bit more confident (still hating all the aloo paranthas though). When we took a break around the 3.5 km mark, the thought was - 'we are almost halfway - ab to pahunch ke hi rahenge' !! But the toughest section was yet to come. We had to stop once more at the 4.5 km mark, and then again at around 6 km. We walked for a few hundred meters pushing our cycles along to regain our breath - the hairpin bends were tough even though we were down to our lowest gears.


We stopped for a couple of photos - sadly, our first photos of the whole ride. Then with new-found energy (maybe it was adrenalin, or gatorade, or maybe even the much accused aloo paranthas, which kept us going....) we cycled up the last couple of km. ""Phew.... !!"" - was the thought at the gates of Nandi hills.

My wife Payal reached about the same time - thrilled at having her first drive up Nandi hills with our
On the way downhill
new Duster AWD. Sadly - 2-wheelers are not allowed on top of Nandi hills, and that includes cycles !!! On second thoughts - maybe I will put a couple of training wheels next time, convert the cycle into a 4 wheeler, and whizz past the security guard !! Stupid rules !!

We parked our cycles - went up to the top in the car. We spent some time on the top though it was pretty hot by then (we reached around 11:10 AM - 5 hours after I started from home). And then was time for the best part of this journey - the CRAZY ride downhill !!😊.. WHIZZZZZZ.. is how we went. I touched a maximum speed of 56kmph, and it was unadulterated fun !!. Some photos were clicked by Aditi (Tatha's wife) this time. In less than 20 minutes, we were at the foothills again.We loaded our cycles on the cars, had a quick picnic of paranthas (home made this time) and chicken curry under the trees, and drove back home. This would be the time to say THANK YOU to Aditi, Payal and Tinai (my sister) for driving up all the way with the kids, bringing
The glee is visible on our faces :)
yummy food, and driving us back. The trip wouldn't have been half as enjoyable without you guys. Back home.. we downed a couple of chilled beers (yep.. we EARNED them). The evening went in a blur - the thrill, tired muscles, lack of sleep and the couple (ok, more than just 2) of beers making for a heady mixture 😊

Tips for the first timer cyclist to Nandi Hills:
1) Give yourself at least 5 hours (if going on an MTB / Hybrid) including breaks.
2) Start early - maybe around 4:30 / 5:00 AM. The uphill climb would be much better.
3) Do NOT eat oily paranthas / anything heavy just before the climb. Light yet high calorie food is the way to go.
4) Include as many breaks as you have to during the climb - remember, you are not racing. It is the journey that matters. Enjoy - you WILL get there.
5) Get a ride back home - cycling back 60 more kms, if you are not used to doing ~100 km rides, would be really tough.
.. and finally...
6) if you wondering whether to do it... I'd say.. JUST DO IT.. it is ABSOLUTELY worth the effort. and yes.. I am definitely going back 😊



Cheers.
BTW - this is my first ever blog. If you reach the end, do drop me a note 😊 Constructive criticism welcome !!

Karnatake state parliament, note the hoarding
Bangalore is big, busy and bustling. Actually, make that huge and hectic. We transited through Bangalore last year without seeing anything except one massive traffic jam that lasted two hours, so this time we thought we’d devote a day to seeing the limited sites it has to offer.

But first we have to get here. Google maps had suggested it would take six hours from our peaceful haven in Wayanad, but we know it will be more. The hotel staff suggest it will take 7-8 hours, so we accede to Mr Hussain’s suggestion that we should leave at 7am. We manage this despite a delay caused by the fact that the mobile phone signal is too weak to allow us to pay our bill by credit card and we have to scrabble around to see if we have enough to pay by cash instead. Mercifully, we do – just. The first part of the journey is slow but scenic, as we head out of the Kerala hills. Then we cross the dusty plains of Karnataka. This should be quicker but a 30 mile stretch of road is being rebuilt so the driving is both slow and bumpy. After five hours
Tipu Sultan's palace
we reach Mysore and the road improves. After eight hours we are on the outskirts of Bangalore. ‘Bangalore very big city, very confusing’ mutters Mr Hussain who, to be fair, must be exhausted after so much driving. It takes another hour to reach our hotel. We are all exhausted. Mr Hussain tells us we must find a guide for the next day, as he does not think he can find his way around. He has a point.

We collapse exhausted into our room, have a very early meal and fall asleep. Next morning, the hotel has not succeeded in finding us a guide. We encounter Mr H as we set out before breakfast to find an ATM to replenish our cash, and suggest to him that we hire an auto rickshaw driver to show us the way. When we reappear after breakfast, he has found us a ‘guide’ who will show us around for 500 rupees. Mr Hussain’s good humour is restored and we set off gratefully.

With a local to guide us, the traffic is not as bad as we feared. Our guide knows the one way system, and which roads are closed while the new metro
Big Nandi in his temple, bejewelled
system is built – a much needed but highly disruptive piece of civil engineering. First stop is Tipu Sultan’s summer palace. This is a much smaller, less ornate version of the one outside Mysore, much of it having been demolished, but interesting nonetheless. A Nandi bull temple follows and then we head to Bangalore Palace. The original building was started by one Reverend Garrett (who was the principal of a local school) in 1862 and bought by the Maharajah of Mysore in 1884 to be their palace in Bangalore (one palace in Mysore was clearly not enough). The Wodeyars were the hereditary rulers of the state of Mysore, within its fluctuating boundaries, from the 14th century. They were periodically deposed by the Deccan sultans, or the Vijayanagar empire, but most famously they lost Mysore to Hyder Ali and his son Tipu Sultan in the 18th century. Those two enlightened rulers were sworn enemies of the East India Company and scored some notable victories over Our Chaps in alliance with the Frenchies. However after Tipu Sultan was defeated and killed by the British at Sriringapatam in 1799, the grateful Wodeyars were reinstated as the ruling Maharajas by the British. They were
Bangalore palace, complete with Windsor turrets
faithful allies and supporters of the British (or should we say, puppets) until Independence in 1947. The Maharajah recently died childless and a cousin who is also without any heirs is currently holding that position, but this may be the end of the Wodeyar line.

The palace is allegedly modelled on Windsor Castle. It has some turrets and you can sort of see what they mean, but it is stretching the point a bit. It’s interesting enough, but Tripadvisor reviews were right when they say it is a overpriced, but it is rather a sorry Maharaja's palace compared to many in India. We decide not to pay £7 (!!) to take a camera in, and conclude this was a good decision. The design of the palace is a weird mix of styles – Gothic, Tudor, Palladian, Spanish art deco.... you name it! The rooms are mostly devoid of furniture and the whole place could do with some maintenance and TLC, though in has been recently renovated so it must have been in a really dire state. For example, the stuffed elephant head over the entrance door is covered in pigeon droppings, and sections of the ceiling seem to be cracking open. The audio tour tells us the Maharajah was a great art collector, but most of his collection seems to comprise execrable knock-offs of classic art and paintings of big boobied and naked white women, or just lousy paintings. Not the best collection ever.....the whole place looks like it is going to fall apart and short of money.



We seem now to have ‘done’ the main sites of Bangalore. Back at the hotel, Sara has the inspired idea of popping to the McDonalds next door for lunch. We virtually never eat McDonalds at home, but sometimes when travelling it fills a craving you didn’t even realise you had. There was a lot of controversy when they first opened in India, as beef is almost universally not acceptable, so the only options are chicken or veggie. The chicken burger and chips are wonderful.

Alright...



Dear family, friends, and others who may be reading this...



I'm still alive! Hooray!



Not that it's really a surprise, but I hope you'll all be pleased to know this. Anyway, let me start with a quick overview of what's going on here:

Basically, in search of a form of 'right livelihood', I started studying Regional Development & Innovation (RDI) back in 2012. There I heard about and got interested in permaculture, which lead to my doing a 10-week internship at Quail Springs in California in 2013, as part of my RDI studies. At Quail Springs I met Malvikaa Solanti and Levi Mataga, who have been working on a permaculture project called SwaYYam in South India. After almost a year and a half of 'regular' studying in Wageningen, I contacted Malvikaa to ask if I could do my 20-week internship at Swayyam. As you probably guessed, she said yes, since I'm typing this in the house she's renting near her land in India...

So far I've been here about 4 days. When I say here, I mean India. I stayed at Malvikaa's daughter's place for 2 days and then we drove south through Mysore and Gundlupet to the Bandipur National Forest & Wildlife Reserve, which also includes several small villages. The closest to where I'm at is called Yelachatti, for those of you who wish to google earth it 😉 It's seriously tiny and reminds me of the villages in Hungary my class went to in 2013, with about 20-30 houses per village.

Here's where I wanted to post some impressions of Bangalore, but unfortunately that's not possible right now due to an unstable internet connection, so this thing is going to be picture-less for the time being. Oh well... time to use your imagination (or google images)!

We only really walked around once to buy some things we needed, so there's an immense part of the city completely unknown to me. Basically it's a concrete jungle, complete with palm trees and other exotic foliage! Although the airport was super-neat, the streets are quite littered with trash and during the day there are people everywhere. Also quite a few stray dogs. The traffic is pretty crazy, but I found it easy to get used to. Just be aware of your surroundings (which y'all should be wherever you are anyway). It surprised me more that they drove on the left, although knowing India's history of British occupation, it shouldn't have surprised me at all I guess.

People everywhere are quite friendly, as long as you smile and are friendly to them. I've gotten some stares, though mostly due to my lip piercing. Malvikaa explained that it's common for men to get earrings (somehow it's good for their health) and for women it's mandatory. Women also get their noses pierced and this usually symbolizes that they're engaged or married. So piercings aren't strange, just the placement, which I guess is the same in most places.

Anyway, I get along great with Malvikaa. And then there's the tiny girl Gheeta who compensates her lack in stature by having the largest smile I've ever seen! Supersweet girl and she's very lucky to get a lot of appropriate support from Malvikaa. Both are also incredible cooks! I have been eating really well (and vegetarian) here and I plan to come back with some great recipes and the knowledge of what to do with them!

So, yesterday morning we left the house at about 5.50 AM and drove and drove to Bandipur. After we arrived we had lunch and then went to the land. There I met 6 people from Auroville (all but one are Europeans) who have been working for a week on building a wooden house on granite beams that have been dug into the ground. It's quite amazing and will look beautiful I'm sure. Today I got to know them a bit better but also 'met' some Indian guys and helped them in the process of getting a 5000 liter water tank up on a stone construction. I took pictures of all of it.

What else can I write... hmm, I feel very comfortable here and have been considering the reasons. Of course the weather is one (although I'm already sunburnt) though I think it might also feel a bit like 'home', since so many things remind me of life in Gabon. The friendliness of the people is also very welcoming. Seriously... Europeans have a lot to learn when it comes to just being nice.

Okay, that's it for now... oh, fyi, I have no idea how to write a blog, so please gimme tips if you want to hear more about this or that.

Kthxbai!

Early morning n Nagarhole
Fortunes change fast on safari, and today is as frustrating as yesterday was wonderful. We have been sharing a jeep with a lone Danish traveller called Jakob and a family of three Indians who are regular visitors to the lodge. The son is in his late twenties, touting a pro model Nikon D4, a second Nikon, and a range of massive lenses. It has already become clear that all he wants to see is big cats, pretty much to the exclusion of anything else. We want to see them too, but we also want to be able to stop and watch other animals when we get the chance of a good shot. This morning, he overrules the ranger’s advice on where to go. We see almost no game of any sort and our patience breaks when we spend about ten minutes with him trying to photograph an eagle that is so far away the rest of us cannot see it. We are even less pleased when we get back and find that everyone else saw a tiger.

At lunch time, we and Jakob, our Danish friend, ask to go out with somebody different in the afternoon. The request does not
Riki Tiki Tavi aka mongoose
seem to surprise anyone and we’re allocated to a different jeep. Our guide from the morning comes over and apologises – he was clearly as frustrated as us. In the afternoon we are with a quiet couple who are much better company. We still don’t see any tigers or leopards, although we hear warning calls and pass the largely dismembered corpse of a deer killed two to three days previously. We smell it long before we see it – a horrible rotting stench that takes us by surprise as try to work out where it could be coming from. Only the birds are left eating it now, and we see two different sorts of vulture perched in the trees above, and crows attacking the remains of the head down on the ground.

We are enchanted by a family of langurs. The little ones play boisterously together, and the smallest baby – maybe two weeks old, and black all over, unlike his pale grey parents, practices walking along a branch. He moves a metre away from his mother and then back again, repeatedly. Sometimes he falls off but scrambles back up, and then has a quick cuddle before setting off
Little langurs at play
again.

Next morning we haul ourselves out of bed for our last game drive. We and Jacob join two others in our jeep and hope that once again there will be just five of us. But at the last minute, another ‘look how big my lens is’ fellow arrives sporting a 600mm lenses, with his son of about 7. A heated conversation ensues with the ranger who then turns to us and asks if we would mind moving to the back of the jeep as the new guy ‘wants both our seats to take photographs’. ‘Er, so do we, and why should we move?’ More heated debate. “blah blah foreigners blah blah” we hear in the Kannada language. 'Are we sure you won't move?' 'Up yours mate’. We begin to think we will never leave but eventually, with much ill grace, he sits in the back (where the view is no worse). Our hopes are raised early on in the drive, when the range spots fresh leopard scat (or shit, as the non naturalist would say). After five minutes, the ranger excitedly shouts ‘leopard’. We crane forward excitedly. ‘Where, where?’ He points to a distant spot in the grass.
Early steps
We make out an indistinct shape moving through the grass and have to take his word that it was a leopard. We don’t even have time to take any photos. Our hopes remain high for a better viewing, but they come to naught.

We return to the lodge where the occupants of one very full jeep, whom we had pitied for being stuck three abreast, were excitedly telling everyone they had seen three tigers, three leopards and three jackals. Surely they must be having us on? But no, they really did see a tiger with cubs, a leopard with cubs and three jackals. We feel cheated and self-pitying. As we muse on this, we reflect that going on safari requires the three Ps – patience, persistence and phlegmatism. By far the hardest of these is phlegmatism – the ability to accept seeing nothing graciously and without resentment. Even when other people have had truly stunning luck and you have not!! David likens it to being an Everton supporter. You keep paying your money to attend and turning up in the hope that one day you will win, but it rarely happens.



After a quick breakfast, we
Look I can stand upright
leave the lodge and set off for the hills in Wayanad, Kerala. As we leave the game park, Mr Hussain points out an elephant – the best sighting of the morning. And then, just as we get back into the car, he shouts ‘snake’ and we see a huge snake slithering with surprising speed across the road. Once out of the forest, we enter a verdant landscape of bright green trees, bushes and paddy fields, in sharp contrast to the dusty brown/grey of the last three days. The towns here are markedly more prosperous than in Karnataka which one must ascribe to the richness of the agriculture as this is not the Kerala of beaches where most tourists we head (we are not tourists, of course, but independent travellers). The roads are properly made up, with a central white line, and the towns often have unbroken pavements. There are many brightly coloured, substantial villas with fine wooden doors and windows that would not look out of place on the Mediterranean. Our next three nights are at a place described as a boutique hotel, in the hills in the heart of a tea plantation. It is hard to describe where it

is but we eventually find our way there. We wind through ever narrower and worse quality roads as we pass one tea estate after another. Our hotel is perched on a hillside overlooking rolling slopes of tea in all directions, with a view to mist covered peaks beyond. The hotel is newly built and we have a spacious room with floor to ceiling glass on two walls, giving a wonderful view. It is a beautiful and peaceful place to enjoy some downtime.

First wild elephant
I love morning game drives. Out at dawn, in time to watch the sun come up over the forest. It’s cool but not cold, in the breeze created as you drive in an open jeep. The air is fresh, and smells slightly of smoke, either woodsmoke from the villagers' fires, or from the controlled but now dead fires set along the paths in the forest to improve the chance of seeing animals. So the first ten to twenty feet from the road is dark grey, with a scattering of ash and some lines of white where logs have slowly smouldered out of existence. Beyond that there is sometimes forest and sometimes scrub. The forest consists of mostly spindly trees, well spaced out, with skinny silver trunks, interspersed with some bigger trees with dark bark that looks like it will drop off in clumps. The scrub is grass and thorny bushes, which look impenetrable from a distance but are in fact threaded with numerous narrow pathways created by animals. It’s the dry season, and everything is brown or a dusty green. The teak trees have shed most of their huge leaves, which cover the forest floor, and only the tops of the
Tiger
bushes have any green left on them.

The first section of this morning’s drive is along the main road that runs through the park. It’s a new experience to share a game drive with lads on motorbikes and the A1 Banana van. Within five minutes we see an elephant right by the roadside, the first wild one we’ve seen in India. After looking both ways (it clearly knows the green cross code) it lumbers across the road and off into the forest. Five minutes later, we hear some alarm calls and stop. Shortly after stopping the ranger shrieks ‘tiger’ and we reverse up to the road in time to watch a large male tiger walk very slowly across the road before vanishing into the undergrowth on the other side. Four cameras click on motordrive. The fastest by far belongs to the Indian guy sitting up front with a pro Nikon and one of the biggest lenses ever seen (complete with camouflage markings in his lens to match the camouflage fatigues he is wearing – what a prat), who is on autoshoot and will have an even bigger job editing his photos than we face. The tiger is majestic, and
Tiger heading into undergrowth
wholly uninterested in us, as tigers always are (unless they are maneaters!).

We turn off onto the red dust roads that criss cross the small section of the park open to tourists, and loop round in the hope of spotting the tiger again. But despite a lot of sitting and waiting patiently, he does not appear again. There’s a lot of sitting waiting involved in game drives and it’s always hard to know how long to wait and when to move on. But that is not our choice, by and large – the ranger decides. If you close your eyes as you sit, you can feel the peace of the surroundings, and start to make out a whole range of different bird calls.

We don’t see so much on the rest of the drive – spotted deer (chital - just like you get in Richmond Park), some sambur, a family of wild boar and a variety of birds. But the pleasure of the drive is partly in the anticipation, and partly in the small things – a myriad tiny cobwebs, white with the dew, on the ground stretched over tiny holes (do the spiders live under ground?), a
On safari
solitary langur monkey sitting at the base of a tree and looking contemplative, the strange site of a termite mound that has been built all the way round a small tree, looking for all the world like a geometric sandcastle that has solidified.

We return to the lodge for breakfast and start the mega-task of downloading and editing the photos before heading out again at 3.45. This time we are on a boat, on the lake formed when the Kabini River was dammed. The lake is now a key part of the park, providing fresh grass which grows in the cracked mud surface left behind when the lake recedes in the dry. In late March (ie just a couple of weeks after we are here) hundreds of elephants will congregate at the lake’s edge to drink and feed on the shrinking grassland available. We don’t see hundreds, but we do have a great view of a group of four elephants who drink from the water’s edge, then slowly walk into the water, spraying themselves all over and wade or swim to the other side before climbing out. There is something very special about elephants, and we could watch them
Eagle
all day. But mostly, the boat trip is about seeing birds. We spot an osprey sitting on a dead tree stump eating a freshly caught fish, and an eagle flying past clutching a small bird in its talons. We manage to get photos of a brilliant blue Indian kingfisher, a beautiful small bird that is elusive and hard to capture on film. And we enjoy the breeze and the peace of the water.



In the evening, we enjoy our first gin and tonic of the holiday. We’re upset to hear we missed a leopard sighting, but that’s the luck of the draw!

Tiger reserve trail
We set off from Coonoor at 7am, bidding farewell to the oasis that is the Taj hotel. Needless to say, as this is the day we are leaving there is not a cloud or patch of mist to be seen and we enjoy distant views across the Nilgiris. We have to stop after about an hour at a charming spot next to a stinking bus station for the driver to buy yet another permit. While he does so we eat our packed breakfast box given to us by the hotel. Finishing this up David, being British, espies a bin and sets off to put the box into the bin. He finds he has to step his way carefully in his open toed sandals to avoid the cow, dog and human turds along the roadside. Getting to the bin he finds it is overflowing, with two dogs with their heads in excavating the contents and there is no space for the box, so he offers the remains of our breakfast to the dogs. Might as well just have thrown the box out of the car window as the roadside is already covered with litter.....

We sit for a few more minutes
Mother and baby langur, 2 weeks old or so
enjoying the stink of diesel fumes from the belching buses, and survey the groups of huddled people waiting on the corners for the gangmasters to arrive looking for day rate workers. Eventually we set off through the beautiful rolling Tamil Nadu national forest (or something like that). The scent of pine and citronella wafts periodically through the window as we wind down to the valley.

Sara is having some bowel problems. This is every Westerner's dread on an Indian road journey. She manages to render three roadside toilets (one in a petrol station and two in a hotel, which was really antisocial) unusable, but what is a girl to do? There is no running water so you just have to do what you have to do and run away. The fourth toilet defeats her though as many previous users' shit is already piled up to the level of the seat, so after the sight and smell of that her body appears to tell her that she can hold on for now. Nothing other than a bluebottle would want to enter that stall.

The temperature is rising and the journey passes hour after hour. We pass through dusty little
Baby clings to mama
towns. In one town we have to stop to buy the Karnataka permit. A legless beggar sees us waiting in the car and drags himself over on his knuckles to scratch pathetically at the car door, while a wretched looking crone with a baby bangs on Sara's window. We resist the temptation to give out cash. Working Indians greatly disapprove of beggars and get really cross if you give them money. Mr Hussain returns to the car and shoos the crone away. I hope he saw the legless creature and didn’t run over him....I hope the squeal was just our tyres burning on the tarmac and not the cries of a squashed beggar.

Eventually we find the turning off the road to Mysore that we need to find. However now the journey gets a bit tricky as all road signs are now in Kannada not Tamil or Malayalam, and Mr Hussain neither reads nor speaks Kannada, so stopping to check our direction of travel becomes a bit trickier. Eventually we find ourselves driving through Mudumalai Tiger Reserve followed by Bandipur Tiger Reserve (this on the main highway to Mysore!). We scan the forest but see only a couple of
Woodpecker busy demolishing tree
elephants in the distance. At one point a couple of thuggish types flag us down and ask if we would like to take a jeep safari into Bandipur. It seems unlikely they are kosher as they are not in uniform and it is midday when no one goes offroad in the park, and we decline their kind offer.

After six hours we roll into our lodge in Kabini, which was formerly the Maharajah of Mysore's private hunting lodge. It sounds very grand but unfortunately these days it is run as government of Karnataka enterprise. The result is that it is overpriced, the food is bland and unvarying, and the service is what you would expect of a state enterprise. But it is the place you need to stay to be sure of getting on safari. The number of visitors per day is limited so you don’t want to find you are staying in a nice lodge but cannot get into the park! We have a nice cottage fronting the lake; this place could be so much better with private management. Such a shame.



We have arrived though in time for our first game drive that afternoon.
Malabar tree squirrel
So some lunch, a short rest and then we are kitted up and ready to go out in the jeep. We see a tiger, but it is a long way off in a clearing and our view is somewhat obscured by a tree. Still, it feels like a good omen.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
February 22nd 2015
Published: February 22nd 2015


Way to Hemakunt Hill
One of the UNESCO world heritage sites, HAMPI is a small village in the northern part ofKarnatakaStateinIndia.



We left for Hampi from Chitradurga afternoon on the last week of December. It took three hours to reach the place.



Hampi is situated on the banks of theTungabhadraRiver. Like Mahabalipuram in Tamilnadu this place also represents the sculptural arts of earlier centuries of the southern parts of the country.



The site remains as the ruins of Vijayanagara Empire. It was part of the capital of this empire in the 14th century.



The major attractions here inter alia include the centuries oldVirupakshaTemple,AchutharayaTemple,HazaraRamaTemple,KrishnaTemple,VittalaTemple, the sacred Tank nearKrishnaTemple, Ganesha Mandapa,UndergroundSivaTemple,AnjaneyaTemple, Elephant Stables, Lotus Mahal, Monolithic Nandi Bull, Tall carved pillars, canals, Aqueducts, Two storied gateway & Tungabhadra river.



In the evening we covered theSivaTemplearea, Royal Enclosure, Fortified walls,WatchTower, the stepped Tank near the underground temple, Elephant stables, etc.



As the trip was shortly planned we were unable to book accommodation in the few hotels available at Hampi or near by town Hospet. Hence we had to cross Tungabhadra to reach Gangavathi, another township around 40 kms from Hampi,
Ruined Fort
where we could book Hotel Sarvesh thru makemytrip. In the night we reached there, had dinner and next day morning returned to Hampi. On the way between the two towns, we could see on both sides of the road various vegetable cultivations, farms, and beautiful meadows.



Next day we moved around the Bazaar area, Hemakunta Hill, Ganesha Mandapa, Kodanda rama &VittalaTemples, Two storied gateway,VirupakshaTemple, etc. Due to shortage of time we had to give up the plan to visit theBearParkin the near by area and by evening we left forBangalore.



The following are some tips which may be useful for a prospective traveler who would like to explore this heritage site:



1.It may take two-three days to cover all the monuments and places in detail as the ruins are vast and spread over large area. Hence either you may plan accordingly or prefer selected items/views after studying the location map.2.Try to fetch accommodation in Hampi itself well advance, which will save a lot of time.3.Carry with you adequate drinking water as no shops are available in most of the parts.4.Eateries are there in the Bazaar area, Mango Tree Restaurant is one
Sunset - Hampi
among them. However avoid peak ours for lunch as these small restaurants would be crowded too much and you have to wait outside for long time.5.For those who plan to connect withBangalore, plan carefully as it would take seven hours journey. En route you can visit Chitradurga fort, another heritage site.

Virupaksha Temple
Hampi, the ancient capital of the Vijayanagara empire is in ruins in North Karnataka. My cousin, her daughter and I decided it is a must see and jumped into the train headed north from Bangalore.

I had booked air-conditioned railway seats but whole night I was wondering if I did indeed because it never worked. I observed my cousin wrapped up in blanket. It was all in anticipation of coming cool air 😊

We arrived at Hampi in early hours. A co passenger kindly offered us a lift to the main town centre. We booked into a budget hotel, freshened up and ventured to see the ruins. It was very hot. We drank water like fish but it was not enough. Apparently all government approved guides were taken. We looked around into the carvings, temples and other ruins like aliens not making a head or tail. Finally, we took an auto rickshaw driver as guide and he took us around and explained the main monuments of attraction.

The city was once magnificent and prosperous ruled by the Deva Raya kings. It had glorious rock cut Hindu and Jain temples, royal baths, elephant stable, market places and gorgeous gates
Hampi ruins
among others. The Vitthal temple with musical pillars made of rock is simply unique. The carvings in the temple were exquisite showing daily life of the people, trading of horses with white Europeans, mythological animals and stories from Ramayana and Mahabharat. This place is apparently the birthplace of monkey god, Hanuman and was formally called Kishkinda. The market place with miles forgotten shops which sold gold-silver jewellery in return of horses must have been splendid. Vijayanagar empire was rich and envy of its neighbouring kingdoms who finally destroyed it.

It was Basanti Panchami or day of Saraswati (goddess of learning) pooja (worship). As per Bengali custom, from this day onwards we start eating crunchy jujube berries! Indeed, we bought some and munched our way to Tungabhadra dam. The vast expanse of water in the reservoir appealed like an ocean for a quick swim. The catchment area had been built into agricultural fields and recreation area for children. An ideal picnic spot.

Since our return train tickets did not get confirmed, we bought local bus tickets which hopped and jumped very badly. I guess, it ensured that bus drivers do not sleep at the expense of poor passengers!
Pillars at Temple

These historical places had attained unimaginable heights in different points of history that we were left awestruck. Even the elephants stables were magnificent. If elephants had such a great life, I am sure humans had an awesome time too.

Suvarna Vidhana Soudha Belgavi
If you don't get lost, there's a chance you may never be found. I am lost. And the journey has begun to search self..

It all happened in 48 hours that I planned my first road trip. Googled many options and finally the route was ride to Pune, Mumbai, Goa and back to Bangalore. Got the much needed permissions from my family and friends. Took my bike to the mechanic and told him to check the bike as I am going on long ride. The misunderstanding between us came as tension to me in middle of nowhere.

My first and solo trip did not let me sleep and concentrate on anything. So finally the day arrived - 25th December. Took the blessings from God and Parents and left my home at 3:30 am. Took a shortcut and reached the Nelamangala flyover. I just covered a distance of 10 kms and there it was! the bike showed a warning of low engine oil. I was shocked, standing on the flyover and cursing the mechanic. I calmed myself down and went to the fuel station in Nelamangala.

The ride in the chilling morning was getting awesome, I had my first
Sunset near Satara
tea break in Tumkur. Plan was to reach Kolhapur till 7 pm for stay. Again started my journey on one of the best roads in India the Bangalore-Pune Highway (NH 4). Reached Davangere at around 9 am and went inside the city to have the famous Benne Dose. My next stop was in Hubli for lunch. Took many breaks in between and reached Hubli at 1 pm. Phew! I was already running two hours late. Went to meet our family friend and had my lunch there. Left Hubli at 4pm and reached the broad and beautiful - NH4. I was 200 kms far from my accommodation. So decided to up the speed but the heavy lunch did not allow me to do so. Reached Belgaum around 7pm and decided to halt there.

On 26th Left Belgaum at 8:30 am to cover a distance of 100 kms. By the previous day’s experience I thought I will cover it in 90 mins but after crossing the border suddenly everything changed except the butter smooth road. At 9:30 am stopped for breakfast and felt the hatred from waiter. Was very much concerned by his behavior as I had to spend my next
Mountains
five days in Maharashtra. The oncoming traffic took a lot of time to reach Kolhapur. It took 2 hours for me to enter the temple as there was huge crowd. Had my lunch in Kolhapur and after some shopping left for Pune. Saw the warning light of low fuel and was very happy that I covered a distance of 754 kms with 15 liters of fuel. As I reached Satara it became even worse - the mad traffic and the road, and finally reached Pune at 8 pm. It was so nice to see my favorite Mama and Mami.

Went for local Pune ride the next day and found myself like AK in PK. No one was following traffic rules, no helmets, no rules nothing. Saw people staring at me for following regulations. While coming back from MG road a guy in Merc was shouting at me for waiting for traffic light to turn green. Educated illiterate eh!? Spent the next two days in Pune and got much needed rest and most needed sleep.

Running short of time, energy and most importantly money I decided to skip Mumbai and head to Goa.

On 29th Dec left for
Greenery.
Panchagani and Mahabaleswar. Visited Ganapati Temple in Wai and started climbing the hill. Reached the next destination by 11 am. Spent some time in city and at various places and left for Ratnagari. Joined Mumbai - Goa highway and reached the city of mangoes by 6 pm and stayed there for the night.

Next day went to Ratnagiri Fort and Ganapatipule temple and beach. Had my breakfast and checked out for the Party Capital around 12 noon. The amazing road and scenic route took a lot of time for me to reach Goa. As expected there was a lot of traffic and the small roads took time for me to reach my uncle’s place.

On 31st went for local sightseeing. Started from a temple called Shantadurga and Mangeshi. And then the churches in Old Goa. Had my lunch in Panaji. In the evening went to Baga and Vagator beach to join the huge crowd for New Year Celebration.

The first day of the new year - 1st Jan 2015, went to Vasco-da-gama and then went to Calangute beach to meet my friend. It was time to head back to Bangalore. Left Margoa at 5 pm and rode
Mountains.
till 9pm and found a room on the highway to spend sleepless nights yet again.

On 2nd Jan, checked out at around 7 am continuing on another superb road from Yellapur to Bankapur. The road goes in thick forest and was very empty. I hardly found anyone using that road. But the 70 kms stretch was superb to ride. Reached the Highway and was waiting to reach home eagerly. On the way back home saw many fellow riders. I had only one traffic signal to deal with. Reached home by 4pm and was very relieved that I made it a safe journey.

It was now time for bike service and got into an argument with mechanic. He thought the long ride will be around 200 kms, but little did he know that I rode 2637 kms in 9 days on my Bajaj Pulsar 220f. Poor him! I was very happy in the end with the bike which gave an average mileage of around 45, whoa! more than what I expected.

As I finish writing this, I have already started planning for my next Bike trip hopefully with some of my friends.

keshava temple
HE SAID...
We left Mudumalai National Park at 10.30am and continued our northward journey, this time heading for Mysore. India is often termed the “land of the farmer”, and we could easily see why as we drove through vast expanses of agricultural land of cotton, palm trees, bananas, sugar cane and rice. Every so often we’d drive through a tiny village, but most of the time the rural landscape stretched to the horizon.

Slow agricultural machinery, trucks and farm animals were sharing very narrow roads with speeding buses, motorbikes and cars – which equated to very dangerous driving conditions. We came across an accident between a bus and a car, but it didn’t appear that anyone was injured.

We dropped into the Chamundi Hill Temple on our way into Mysore. We wandered through the popular and crowded temple, and on the way out I made a donation to the temple and picked up an orange rope bracelet and a red/orange cotton bracelet (which I wore for the rest of our India travels). We jumped back in the minibus and headed towards Mysore, eventually arriving at 2.30pm.

We checked into Hotel KVC International and ordered dahl tadka (cooked lentils
chamundi hill
topped with tempered spices) and vegetable shahajahani (vegetable curry) for lunch in Spicy Dine, the hotel’s restaurant. The menu description for vegetable shahajahani was ‘vegetables cooked in semi Indian gravy’. I wasn’t entirely sure what semi Indian gravy was, but it tasted great.

We had a masala chai (spiced sweet milky tea) to freshen up before heading out to Mysore Palace at 4.30pm. We wandered around the impressive but crumbling palace for about an hour, and I was amazed at the skill of the painters who’d managed to paint a cow in one of the frescos whose eyes and face literally followed you as you walked past it. I walked back and forwards past this cow at least three times, and the illusion was extraordinary. Unfortunately we were being led through the palace by a local guide with a bit too much attitude and an enormous chip on his shoulder, and it tainted my experience somewhat. On our way back to the hotel we briefly stopped in at St Philomena’s Church and the Eco-Friendly Incense Sticks Factory.

We had a few drinks in the hotel’s roof top bar before heading out to dinner at the Park Lane Hotel
chamundi hill
Restaurant at 7.30pm. We shared an aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry) with butter naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) and parathas (naans stuffed with potato), and it was excellent. The combination of potato and cauliflower in a hot curry sauce is just so good. Four of us crammed into an auto rickshaw (motorised tricycle with a passenger cabin) on the way back to the hotel, where we kicked back in the rooftop bar before heading down to the hotel lobby at midnight to access the free wifi. It had been a long travel day, and we were exhausted.

We headed out for a morning walk at 8.30am and unknowingly found ourselves in the midst of Pongal celebrations, a four day festival where families get together to honour the year’s harvest. We realised the day was a little different to most when we met a yellow cow in the street. Cows are honoured for their contribution to the harvest, and this involves colouring the cows yellow. We also passed a number of women creating rangoli (colourful chalk drawings) on the streets outside their houses. We withdrew some rupees from a guarded ATM, stopped at a tiny
chamundi hill
cafe (Preethi Sagar) for a chai (tea) and met a few more yellow cows on our way back to the hotel.

We jumped into a minibus at 9.30am and headed to the Keshava Temple in Somanathapur, an hour’s drive from Mysore. We wandered around the temple in the intense morning sun, got a little distracted by a full-on wedding photo shoot, cooled down with a fresh coconut juice and then headed back to Mysore at midday.

On the drive back to Mysore, the tranquillity of rural India slowly gave way to the mayhem of urban India, and this transition continued to amaze me. We headed straight to the Red Pepper Restaurant, cooled down with a fresh lime soda (fresh lime juice, sugar syrup, salt and soda water) and ordered a ‘veg thali’ – with rice, paratha (naan stuffed with potato), vegetable soup, rasam (spicy tamarind broth), gobi manchurian (spicy cauliflower stir-fry), paneer butter masala (Indian cottage cheese curry), dahl curry (lentil curry), beetroot poriyal (beetroot fried with coconut and spices), pickle, curd, and a pappadam.

We finished lunch at 2pm and made our way to Mysore’s fascinating Devaraja Market. We wandered around the market stalls which were
chamundi hill
crammed with vivid flowers, fruits and vegetables before walking back through the city streets to our hotel. We were leaving Mysore at 8.30pm on an 11 hour overnight train to the eastern coast of India, so we settled in the hotel lobby with the free wifi and caught up on our travel notes.

We jumped into a minibus at 6pm and headed out to dinner in the house of a local Mysorean family. They’d prepared vegetable biryani (a spiced rice dish cooked with vegetables), brinjal curry (eggplant/aubergine curry), mixed vegetable curry, chicken tandoori (roast chicken marinated with a special spice paste and yoghurt), and cucumber raita (yoghurt based sauce); followed by custard and gulab jamun (fried doughnut-like milk-based balls, soaked in spiced sugar syrup). It was fantastic, and a fascinating insight into local customs. After thanking our hosts, we clambered into the minibus and headed to the train station.

Fortuitously, Mysore Palace was on the way, and its many thousands of light bulbs had been switched on for the Pongal Festival. The Palace was glowing, so we jumped out and joined the throngs of locals who were enjoying the spectacle. I felt like a moth being unwittingly drawn
mysore palace
to a bright light – it was an incredible experience.

We arrived at the train station at 8pm, picked up some snacks and boarded our overnight sleeper carriage for the 11 hour trip to Chennai. I was amazed that we were the only non-locals on the train. Families had settled in with home-cooked meals and children were excited about the journey ahead. It was a warm and friendly atmosphere.

The train left at 8.30pm on the dot. We sat and talked with two young students who were sharing our berth before settling into our bunks at around 10.30pm. The gentle rocking of the train had me asleep in no time.



SHE SAID...
It was a wrench to leave the peaceful Jungle Retreat in Mudumalai National Park for the four hour minibus ride to Mysore. The jungle landscape soon gave way to Karnataka’s plains and open farmland. We passed fields of banana trees, cotton trees and coconut trees.

The drive was mostly uneventful and I slept for about 90% of it. We were dreadfully behind on writing our blog notes and I had hoped to catch up on the bus trip, but a few late
st philomena’s church
nights in a row were starting to catch up with us. We stopped at the chain Cafe Coffee Day for hot drinks, but it was the clean toilet that was the main reason for the stop.

Mysore is the second largest city in Karnataka and used to be the royal capital (Bangalore is the State capital now). This was to be our only stop in this State. The main languages spoken in Mysore are Kannada and Hindi.

As we approached Mysore, our minibus wound its way up Chamundi Hill on the edge of town. There were convoys of buses carrying pilgrims up the same hill, and it was a little disconcerting that the buses were full beyond capacity and being driven by complete maniacs.

At the top of the hill we explored Sri Chamundeswari Temple, dedicated to the Goddess Durga. Leaving our shoes in the open air ‘cloak room’ across the street, we had just enough time to enter the temple before it closed. As we squeezed past the gate I realised the ground we were walking on was full of things I wouldn’t like to step in barefoot, but I had to put that out of
rangoli designs
my mind and keep walking.

It was the first day of the Pongal Harvest Festival and we got a little lost in the hustling, bustling crowd streaming in with their offerings. Crowds like this at first appear overwhelming in India (especially as they are so loud), but the people were very friendly and just parted to let us through. Inside the temple we made a swift circuit, and I did my best to dodge the priests dishing out blessings for a small ‘donation’. However, Karni organised blessings for all of us which were given with a tilak (red powder marking) on our foreheads.

Outside as we mixed in with the woman, men and children, I was very aware that it was so crowded that I couldn’t see the ground – and when there are cows, dogs and goats around, it pays to always see where you are putting your feet. Andrew and Lee stopped to buy bracelets for us - I picked a black one with red beads, while Andrew picked an orange one for himself.

From the hilltop, the view of Mysore was quite beautiful and far greener than I’d imagined an Indian city to look
tumeric coloured cow
like. We descended the hill a little way to a nearby statue of a large black monolithic bull (Nandi). The Goddess Durga is an incarnation of Parvati, wife of Shiva, and apparently wherever there’s a connection to Shiva, there’s a bull.

The southern Indian states celebrate the Hindu festival Pongal – a four day harvest thanksgiving celebration in mid-January – to honour the weather gods, the land’s abundance and their cattle. Pongal seems to be associated with many legends, but I like the legend which involves Lord Shiva and his bull Nandi the most. In the legend, on the third day of Pongal, Lord Shiva sent Nandi to tell the people to have an oil bath daily and eat once a month. However, Nandi got confused (as a bull probably would) and told people to eat daily and bathe once a month. This angered Shiva, so he banished Nandi to earth to help the people to toil the ground and produce more food.

On the first day of Pongal (which was our first day in Mysore), people usually buy new goods and clothes to celebrate the start of a new cycle. The second day is when the sun
keshava temple
god Lord Surya is offered special prayers. People wear their new clothes and decorate their houses with rangoli (floor designs using rice flour and coloured clay - they are called kolam in Tamil Nadu). On the third day the cattle are honoured for their part in farming life – they are washed, rubbed down with a turmeric paste, have their horns painted and are sometimes decorated with flowers. The fourth day is reserved for gathering and celebrating with families and friends.

The main food of the festival is sakkarai pongal – a dish of the season’s first rice, fresh milk, jaggery (a solid product produced from reducing sugar cane juice or palm sap), coconut, raisins, cashews and cardamom, all of which are boiled to almost a paste. When the milk and rice are boiled in a claypot, if the pot boils evenly on all sides, it’s a sign of prosperity and abundance for the year to come. Given that rice is grown throughout southern India, it’s not surprising that there are so many rice dishes – especially festive rice dishes.

We arrived in Mysore and checked into our hotel – KVC International Hotel. The street was very green
keshava temple
and calm, the hotel had huge clean rooms with hot water that worked, but annoyingly, the wifi only worked in the lobby. The biggest let down at this hotel was that the hotel staff were inefficient, slow and uninterested.

We decided to have a quick lunch in the hotel restaurant, but it was anything but quick. We ordered dahl tadka (cooked lentils topped with tempered spices) and vegetable shahajahani (vegetable curry) and rice. A guy with a really bad toupee took ten minutes to take our order, with much repeating, clarifying and more repeating. I was beginning to think we were in a sketch comedy. The food was surprisingly good, but then the bill saga began. It took Andrew 20 minutes to get (and pay) the bill. We later realised that money could only be handled in one area of the hotel, so when the staff ask for the bill, the bill was first generated by a cashier, then walked up or down to the floor we were on, then walked back to the cashier, then walked back to us with our change. How could a business as large as this hotel operate so inefficiently??

After the frustratingly
keshava temple
disorganised hour that it took us to have lunch and put some laundry in, we headed to the Mysore Palace. Mysore Palace is a product of the Wodeyar Dynasty heritage and is set in huge grounds of courtyards and gardens planted with palm trees. We had to surrender our cameras and leave our shoes in a locker before we gained entry. We were accompanied by a local guide who immediately annoyed most of us with his smartarse sayings and forced, tragic, dad-type jokes. He had clearly memorised his spiel and was put off if anyone interrupted to ask questions.

The palace is supposed to be one of the most ornate palaces in India – its interior was an in-your-face kaleidoscope of coloured glass and mirrors. It was built by the Maharaja of Mysore at the end of the 19th Century and it is a mixture of many styles of architecture and decor. The palace contained a heart wrenching amount of ivory, and more than expected amounts of blingy silver and gold. The most over-the-top items for me were the bejewelled throne and the heavy gold howdah (a seat placed on the back of an elephant with a railing and
keshava temple
canopy)... because apparently the well fed Maharaja wasn’t already heavy enough on the poor elephant’s back. There was a sense that this palace was furnished on the basis that ‘more is better’. If anyone needs a good example of man's inhumanity to taste – we found it! 😊

Even though most aspects of the decor weren’t to my taste, there were some features that were quite stunning. I loved the floor tiles and extensive stained glass in peacock motifs in the Marriage Pavilion. The soaring ornate ceilings and sculpted pillars in the Durbar Hall were eye catching, but I did question the colour choices! And the intricately carved wooden doors throughout the palace were beautiful.

My favourite part of the palace involved the paintings that had been painted with a 3D effect, where the eyes of some of the humans and the heads of the animals followed you from one side of the room to the other – our guide liked calling them ‘the Indian Mona Lisas’. It was impressive enough that a few of us kept walking backwards and forwards to test the theory.

After our un-engaging tour, we walked to the large forecourt / parade
keshava temple
ground area for a front-on look at the palace. We arrived at the same time as a large posse of small school girls in matching uniforms, and their teacher decided to send them over to practise their English. So in a very cute chorus, we got roared at... ‘hello!whereyoufromwhatsyourname?’. I disentangled myself out of the scrum of little people, but Kim and a few others were more accommodating of their high pitched squeals.

Mysore was the first place in India to get extensive electricity in the late 1920s, as the then Maharaja had built a hydroelectric power station. To this day, on some special festivals the whole palace is lit up in lights and everyone is welcome to come into the grounds to see it. We were lucky to see this on our last night, as it was lit up for Pongal. It was quite stunning to see all the buildings outlined in thousands of lights. It was packed and we were warned to keep together. I love seeing local people enjoying their own city, especially when tourist attractions in India are beyond the means of most locals (even though they pay much lower entrance fees than foreigners).
keshava temple

On our way back to the hotel we dropped into St Philomena’s Church. I quite liked this church, but there were quite a few people praying and I didn’t wish to intrude, so I didn’t look around as much as I wanted to. As with most churches we've seen in India so far, it was very apparent that it could have done with some general repairs - and it was good to see that there was a fundraising board outside for this cause.

Mysore is known for its incense, so we expressed an interest in visiting an incense factory. To say it left a bad taste in our mouths was an understatement... we walked into a small, cramped space off a little laneway and there were two people sitting on the floor rolling incense sticks at an alarmingly fast rate. One was an older woman of about 70, and the other a girl of about 20 or less. There was something very wrong about the guy running the place, and we all felt it. He sourced his workers from orphanages and other welfare organisations, and he claimed the workers were paid regardless of the number of incense sticks they
devaraja market
rolled, but I could tell by the young girl’s face that this wasn’t true. We might be wrong and he might have been a nice guy, but it speaks volumes that almost all twelve people in a group were creeped out by him. I was glad that no one bought anything from his business.

The usual suspects gathered for pre-dinner drinks at our hotel’s bar before our minibus drove us to Park Lane Restaurant for dinner. The rooftop restaurant setting was quite lovely and we had an enjoyable meal of aloo gobi (potato and cauliflower curry) with butter naans (leavened bread cooked in a wood fired oven) and parathas (naans stuffed with potato). We caught auto rickshaws (motorised tricycles with a passenger cabin) back to the hotel, had one last drink in the hotel bar before calling it a night.

Early the next morning, Andrew and I went for a walk around the hotel to find an ATM. We asked the bank guard for a chai (tea) stall recommendation and he pointed us in the direction of a small street just off the main road. The smaller streets were yet to awake and it was a nice quiet
devaraja market
walk. It was the second day of Pongal, and of the few people out and about, women were drawing rangoli designs on the footpaths in front of their houses while men were congregating at the chai shops.

Preethi Sagar Cafe was a busy little hive of a place with a constant stream of breakfast customers, but we weren’t hungry so we sat with our glasses of chai and people-watched. As was the case in all the smaller shops and cafes we went to, I was the only female present.

Later that morning we drove out into the countryside an hour from Mysore, to the Keshava Temple in Somanathapur. On the way we passed more farmland, mostly just-harvested rice fields that cattle were now being grazed on.

Keshava Temple is a beautiful example of Hoysala temple architecture from the 13th Century. It is enclosed within a high wall, and we entered the rectangular complex through a room with tall pillars. The temple is made of soapstone that has aged to a warm grey. While it is no longer active, the temple was once dedicated to Vishnu. There are three shrines which contained a statue each – two of
devaraja market
the statues are original, but the third was ‘taken by invaders’. Our guide was quite good and seemed to enjoy his job. It was a public holiday for Pongal, so the guide’s wife and three children joined us for the tour, and they were dressed in beautifully colourful festive clothes.

The Hindu faith is a way of life for most Indians, and our guide seemed determined that we grasped the basics of the religion – a religion characterised by millions of gods/goddesses and reincarnation leading to a better life. We learned about Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva, along with their wives and children.

The three shrines have a striking star shaped design with highly decorative towers above them. The outside walls are covered in panels with decorative bands of friezes and carved reliefs. The panels have sculpted swans, yalis (part lion part horse mythical beasts), horsemen and a procession of elephants at the bottom. The other walls depicted detailed epics and stories from Hindu texts which were intricately and beautifully carved. The main hall, the three shrines and their associated rooms were all as decorative as the outside walls.

I liked these carvings more than many I’ve seen
devaraja market
in other Hindu temples, as they weren’t painted in garish colours. There was a symmetry and balance to the overall design that I loved, and there was also a very lovely ambience to this place. I think I would rate this as one of my favourite Hindu temples to date! 😊

On the way back to Mysore we stopped at the Red Pepper Restaurant for lunch. We all ordered the ‘veg thali’, which came with rice, paratha (naan stuffed with potato), vegetable soup, rasam (spicy tamarind broth), gobi Manchurian (spicy cauliflower stir-fry), paneer butter masala (Indian cottage cheese curry), dahl curry (lentil curry), beetroot poriyal (beetroot fried with coconut and spices), pickle, curd and a pappadam.

Back in Mysore, we visited the central Devaraja Market that specialised in fruit, vegetables and flowers. It was a riot of colour! My camera couldn’t keep up with the pace at which the market moved. The flower market was like nothing I’ve ever seen. There were whole rows of stalls that were dedicated to selling one or two specific flowers, and the negotiations between the merchants were loud and swift. The walkways were narrow and manic with men hurrying past with multiple
devaraja market
sacks on their backs or garlands of marigolds stacked high on hand carts. Andrew’s tall frame isn’t easily missed in an Asian market, but I frequently lost sight of him in the hustle and bustle. I’m not sure if the market is always that busy or if it was more hectic because of the Pongal festival.

We were catching an overnight train that evening, so our group was using two day rooms until we left. We got back to the hotel, showered and organised ourselves for the onward journey.

We had been invited to an early dinner at a local family home. The table for the thirteen of us took up the entire living space in their house. The couple’s two grown daughters had come over to help cook for us. Pressure cookers hissed and whistled in the kitchen, a sound I associated with my parent’s kitchen in my childhood. The meal was simple but delicious – an incredible vegetable biryani (a spiced rice dish cooked with vegetables), brinjal curry (eggplant/aubergine curry), chicken tandoori (roast chicken marinated with a special spice paste and yoghurt) and cucumber raita (yoghurt based sauce). If truth be told, I’m not a fan
devaraja market
of biryani... I find it dry and a bit ‘meh’, and the only time I really enjoyed it was in Malaysia, where they ‘flood’ the biryani with curry sauces. However, this version of biryani was quite moist and tasty. For dessert we were served a very sweet custard and gulab jamun (fried doughnut-like milk-based balls soaked in spiced sugar syrup). I haven’t talked about Indian desserts yet – they have coma-inducing amounts of sugar in them, so I’ve only been having a small serving – which is a first in all my travels!

On the way to the station we dropped in to see the lights of the palace before continuing on to catch the first of our two overnight trains in India. We got to the station and joined the masses of people rushing to get night trains to different destinations all over the country. I was pleasantly surprised that the Indian railway system was nowhere near as decrepit or disorganised as I had read it was.

Our packs fitted neatly underneath our seats. I’d heard of thefts on the trains, so if our packs had been too big to shove under the seats, I would have
devaraja market
shared my bed with my bag rather than leave it sitting in the walkway – one of the advantages of having short legs. 😊

The overnight train from Mysore to Chennai was supposed to take 11 hours. It was our sixth overnight train in Asia, but it was a first for some members of our travelling group. We were in second class 3AC, which was an air-conditioned carriage with berths containing three bunks on either side of the wall and two bunks opposite in the walkway. This is the first time we’ve had triple bunks, and I’m not sure which bunk I prefer. However, the top bunk is the most private, and you can lie down whenever you want to as it’s a standalone bunk. During the day the middle bunk is folded up and the bottom bunk acts as a seat for all three occupants. So depending on who you’re sitting with, you could be relegated to lying in your bunk very early in the journey rather than sitting comfortably until you’re ready to sleep. The ‘ladder’ for the upper bunks consisted of two very small rungs that jutted into the walkway, and in 3AC the top bunk
local family dinner
was pretty high... I’m surprised no one had an accident on descent. Andrew and I got the two bunks in the walkway, so the politics of the three bunk system didn’t apply.

Having learnt my lesson from overnight trains in Vietnam, I packed a few layers of clothing and a warm jacket for when the aircon was cranked to ‘arctic’. However, this train kept fairly warm all night. Sheets, pillows and blankets were provided and looked clean enough, but I’d packed my own tiny silk sleep-sheet which was very comfortable. I did a bit of writing in my upper bunk, but I drifted off to sleep as the train picked up speed and started swaying a bit. I woke up once during the night when the train stopped to pick up passengers, and the next time I woke was at 5am when we were nearing Chennai.

I was a little concerned about the stories I’d heard about ‘train mice’, and I can confirm that they do exist. I only saw one, and I had no other option but to ignore it and hope it didn’t pop into my upper bunk during the night! We’d already been warned about
mysore palace at night
not carrying any food in our packs or leaving any food on the floor.

Having had many conversations with friends and family about train toilets, I’d like to report that the toilets weren’t nearly as horrible as I’d imagined. They were ok-ish to begin with, but Andrew reliably informed me that they were a bit ‘messy’ as the trip wore on. As per my usual way of coping with train toilets, I tried not to drink too much, but I get headaches from being dehydrated, so I just had to get over it. As with most things, the reality is never as bad as the perception, and they really weren’t that bad when I used them at 5am. However, I think I went through a week’s supply of wet wipes and hand sanitizer in that one trip to the toilet.

If you want some ‘toilet tips for moving trains' – shoes are always better than thongs (flip flops) for obvious reasons; tight fitting leggings or trousers are better than floppy/baggy ones; and the squat toilets are far cleaner than the western-styled toilets. But let’s face it – neither option is going to be a very pleasant experience. But
overnight train
I lived. And I didn’t get Ebola. 😊

Our next stop is Chennai (Madras) on our way to the seaside village of Mamallapuram on the east coast of Tamil Nadu.

Home-stay
This is my first blog, although I have traveled alot but never thought of sharing my thoughts. I don’t know what drove me to write but I decided let’s start sharing my thoughts. So we 5 friends took self-drive car from Zoom cars and on 27thDec2014 midnight we left from Bangalore. We took the following route to reach Kemmanagundi

Bangalore-Tumkur-Gubbi-Tiptur-Arasikere-Kadur-Birur-Lingadahalli.

After Tumkur one needs to take a deviation from NH-4 and join NH-206.The traffic on this highway was relatively less compared to others. There is a stretch of 130km which is single lane and very beautiful. Around 4am we stopped in between on the highway and all of us shared all our experiences about life and one of our friend is singer who sang beautiful songs. Then we started again at 5am and then at Kadur we had tea. We then proceeded towards Birur, where one has to take a deviation towards left which leads to Lingadahalli. The road condition starts to deteriorate once the deviation is taken at Lingadahalli.This is the point where one can start getting the glimpses of the Kemmanagundi. One can see cloud covered hills and valleys creating a very beautiful view. The pollution free

Home-stay
environment, the chilling
weather, cool breeze added the excitement. After Lingadahalli one needs to take left turn on Sh-57 and follow the Karnataka tourism boards. We had already booked a home stay “Kanthi niwas” for us. The owner James was a very courteous man. We had our breakfast and then headed towards Kalhatti falls.

Kalhatti falls:

Kalhatti falls are situated in village named as Kalhattipura. The water here comes from height of 100+ meters in front of Veerabhadreshwara temple. One can see three elephants carved on the rocks right in front of the temple, over which the water falls. We then went to the top of the falls through the stone steps placed next to the falls to get view of the falls. There was very less water however we even enjoyed there and then returned back to our home stay to have our lunch and then we got ready to head towards Kemmanagundi hills.

Kemmanagundi hills:

We headed towards Kemmanagundi hills which were around 15kms from our home-stay. The road leading to Z point was really steep and had bad patches in between. We reached there in 45 minutes to enjoy the beautiful sunset, watching
IMG_2625
Sunset
the changing color of sky from orange to red to dark. The serene beauty and beautiful sky took our heart away. There is a Government guesthouse at that point. We then went back to our home-stay which took around 40 minutes to reach. James had arranged bonfire for us, we sang, danced had our dinner and then slept.

Next day morning we had our breakfast and we enjoyed cycling for some 4 to 5kms and played badminton and then headed back towards Bangalore.

selling flowers @ Krishnarajendra Market
Where should we stay in Bangalore? We had 2 options: a B&B which sounded quite promising bang in the middle of the town or a very promising B&B in Whitefield that was much cheaper and, to top it, one of the 30 most charming B&B in India (according to Conde Nast Traveller). We took the one that offered us a bed first with a lovely email: the Villa Camelotin Whitefield. And yes, living far out of the town was a disadvantage. But we were so lucky to have stayed in Villa Camelot - the advantages outweighed the disadvantages. Well, I will start from the beginning....

To reach Bangalore from Mysore is easy. Just go to the Central Bus Station in Mysore. There are buses departing nearly every 5 minutes. Within 2 hours we reached Bangalore and immediately got a first taste of what this city is about: constant traffic jam! It took us another hour to reach the centrally located bus terminal. We got of our bus and asked around for local buses in the direction of Whitefield. We had no idea where exactly our B&B was located. Whitefield is the IT area of Bangalore with lots of high tech industry
@ Krishnarajendra Market
as well as some excellent malls, restaurants etc.. It is quite a leafy area, but round about 16-20 ks away from downtown. We just knew this and had the address. So we wanted to reduce the rickshaw costs by simply covering most of the way by public transport. It was not a major problem. We found a Whitefield bound bus. The bus driver told us to get off at a certain point. And we were trying to get a rickshaw. That was difficult as all drivers obviously wanted to ripp us off. But with some patience we found a nice driver who even called our hosts and brought us there safely and by using the meter! A lucky punch. We were welcomed by the hosts Yamini and Raghu with a big hug, huge smiles and a steaming cup of hot chai. It was the warmest welcome we have ever had by arriving in an accomodation! And what an accomodation it was! Really nice decorated, all perfectly clean and our room was just amazing: huge, a great bathroom and an amazing shower. We did not get a key, as the room was simply part of the family house where we had
Kempfort Shiva Temple
a room with a bathroom. By stepping outside the room we were standing in the family living room and the kitchen. We were so happy to have chosen this place. For the rest of the afternoon we just relaxed by talking with our hosts. Amazing, how similar minded we were. Sometimes one has to travel half way around the globe to find some soulmates :-). The day went by, we made so amazing new friends and we still had no idea what to do and see in Bangalore. But we did not care. We all had dinner together. And had a perfect sleep in the comfy bed without any stains or bedbugs. Also next morning we took it slowly. After a great breakfast, Raghu drove us the 2 ks to the next bus stop. It was sunday, so it took us only 1 hour to reach town. We got off the bus close to the Garuda Mall. After so many spiritual place where we have been in the last days, we really enjoyed some extensive shopping experience. We walked around the MG Road area, a really beautiful part of Bangalore: new shopping malls for the middle class, tree lined streets
with our hosts Yamini and Raghu @ Villa Camelot in Whitefield
and clean streets! There were lots of fantastic restaurants and bars. Wow, this was a totally different part of India which we had not seen so far. This is modern India where even the girls walk around in short trousers. We also enjoyed the atmosphere of the city. It is ruled by business, but somehow people are relaxed, well educated and friendly. For lunch we managed to get a table in the famous and delicious Queen's Restaurant in Church Street. We had some typical south indian treats with veggy curries, dhal and fluffy and hot chapathi. YUMMY!

After lunch we walked around the Vittal Mallya Road area (Grant Road). Wow! Now we believe what we have heared so often: in India, there are living the poorest people as well as the richest people in the world. Well, we were walking among the richest part of Bangalore for sure. We visited the richest mall where we have ever been before (the Trump Center in New York is nothing against that). In our backpacker clothes we truly felt like being at the wrong place. But it was amazing for people watching. And the toilets were wonderful (I never believed I would
Garuda Mall
Bangalore CBD
ever say this about a toilet in India ;-)). Later we walked through the leafy Cubbon Park and passed the State Central Library, the Attara Kacheri (High Court) and the Vidhana Soudha (the government of Karnataka). All these were fantastic colonial buildings. Slowly we made our way back to MG Road and caught a bus back to Whitefield.

The next day, Monday, we naively thought to be back in town by bus in 1 hour. Well, it took us 2 hours! By midday we got of the bus in the Chickpet area. This is the wholesale area of Bangalore with old houses, narrow streets full of little lorries and rickshaws. It is busy, busy, busy. In the beginning we did not know how to take it all in. It was too much for our senses. But after a while it was great fun. We walked along the streets, visited some of the little shops til we finally reached Krishnarajendra Market, the oldest and busiest market in Bangalore. It was really old, but so wonderful. No need to mention that it was packed with people.... We continued with a visit to the old Fort of Bangalore and the Tipu Sultan's
downtown Bangalore
Palace. Unfortunately, it was already quite late, so the beautiful Venkataraman Temple (a Vishnu Temple) close to the Sultan's Palace was already closed. We took a rickshaw back to MG Road - and it took us 1 hour to cover the 6 ks. The traffic is unbelievable in this city. The streets are simply full with all means of transport. We had a quick bite to eat before we took a bus in the direction of Whitefield again. But this time we got off at the Kempfort Shiva Temple (which is about half way). This is a very special and beautiful Shiva Temple right behind a huge mall. We spend one hour in the temple. And then it was time to meet a friend. We met Shilpa in Madikeri for the first time at the Abbi Falls and later that day again in a temple in town. We became Facebook friends. When we wrote her that we are in Bangalore where she lives, we quickly found time to meet again. Together with a good friend of her, Niharika, we 4 went for dinner in a restaurant. Later we were invited to Shilpa's home to meet her mum and her brother.
modern indian ladies on MG Road
It was a great evening and the 2 ladies took great care of us. They even drove us around carefully on their scooters! Herewith we want to thank them again for the lovely evening!



On our last day in Bangalore we went again back to town by bus. OK, again it took us nearly 2 hours to reach the town. This time we went to the Commercial Street, a fantastic shopping street with small shops galore! Unfortunately, it was already too late to visit the Bangalore Palace. We skipped this one. instead we took a rickshaw and went to the Iskcon Bangalore. We both enjoyed the Iskcon temple in Mumbai a lot. The Bangalore temple is much bigger. And it is extremely beautiful. The walls and the ceilings are made of pure gold - and they are not covered with gold, it is solid gold! The murthis (statues of the deities) are also amazing! Wow, we were speechless. We spend some time there for meditation and an aarti. Then it was time to get a rickshaw to the central bus terminal and the bus to Whitefield. To reach our home it took us 3 hours! By that
MG Road shopping craziness
time we were really fed up with the traffic. We love Bangalore. Although there are not many touristic spots to visit, there are a lot of different things to see. We love these kind of cities where there is not much to do from a touristic point of things. But when you follow the suggestion of the locals it is a fantastic city. We had a fantastic homestay, met so many wonderful people. But the traffic is so horrible!

Bangalore has showed us a different kind of India, a modern face. In between our travels we were shocked so many times about the way even young people still think positively about the arranged marriage, about a lot old society rules and a lot of society pressure. These surely may exist in Bangalore as well. But there are a lot of well educated, very open minded young people that create the future of India in a very positive way. One can feel that they want to break out (and they do break out) of this pressure. And what is wonderful to observe, they are very proud to be part of a modern, forward looking India.

There is still a
Church Street
lot to see in Bangalore and we will come back for sure one day. Especially, to visit our new friends again who made our stay great (despite the traffic)! For sure, staying in the middle of town would have saved us a lot of hours on the bus, but we would not have met so amazing people! Thank you so much guys!

January 2nd 2015
Published: February 21st 2015


on Chamundi Hill
This is India: a temple, an old car and a cow combined with lots of people around
We thought it was a great idea to go to Chamundi Hill on New Year's Day. Well, we were not really the only ones having this idea. To put it shortly, Chamundi Hill was packed with people! We decided to take the foot trail up the hill. 1000-plus steps were awaiting us..... and lots of other pilgrims. Most pilgrims blessed each step with some kumkum (red and yellow powder). We just tried to make our way up quietly which was difficult with lots of people wishing us a happy new year and wanting to shake our hands. We did not want to be rude and started to play the game with them. But after I do not know how many people and pictures we gave up. We really felt extremely bad but there was no chance to arrive on top of the hill in 1 day with being friendly to all the people. After 2/3 of the way we arrived at the huge statue of Nandi, Shiva's bull. It is a really impressing statue being carved out of a solid rock in 1659.



The platform on top of Chamundi Hill was full with people, sellers, cows and cars.
Yoganarashima Temple in Melkote
As we have been here a year before we were not too shocked and made our way to a swami who was giving some blessings. We received our blessing and then decided to buy an express ticket to enter the temple. Without an express ticket we would have had to wait for 3 hours in a squeezed queue. Still it took us about 40 minutes to enter the temple. Once in the temple, it was a fight to receive the darshan of the devi with all the people pushing and squeezing each other. But we were lucky and even got some space to stand still in front of the deity. Again outside, we relaxed with a fresh coconut in the shade before making our way to 2 other temples on the hill. These ones were beautiful but small and both of them really packed with people. In one temple I was squeezed in between a door and people; I could hardly breeze any more and I gave up. This is crazy! Finally we had enough of the crowd and took a public bus down the hill and back to downtown Mysore. We had a relaxing lunch on a rooftop terrace
lunch time in Melkote
overlooking Gandhi Square. Fresh fruit juices, kofta, curries, kulchas and dal - what a start of the new year. In the afternoon we just walked around the little streets in Mysore and took in the wonderful atmosphere of this amazing city. As we had already been to the palace a year ago we really took it easy this time. A visit to the Philomena's Cathedral and a walk over the Devaraja Market was enough tourist activity for us. For the rest of the day we went shopping. In the evening we had dinner at the famous RRR Hotel. The Thali is really good and cheap - but it is extremely spicy! So if you decide to check it out, be prepared!



The next day we were longing for getting out of the busy city again. We needed some country quietness again. We took a bus from the public bus stand to Jakkanahalli from where we took a rickshaw up to the pilgrimage village of Melkote. Melkote is a devout Vishnu pilgrimage village. It is home to the 12th-century Cheluvanarayana Temple with its rose-coloured gopuram (gateway tower). It is a really peaceful town and we loved it instantly
Nina doing some pranayamas on the hill in Melkote - a perfect place
when we arrived. Each house is decorated with the symbols of vishnu and nearly all people walk around having the vishnu tilak on their forehead. We bought some offerings for a pooja at a stand from a friendly lady outside the Cheluvanarayana Temple. She put some flowers in my hair - she was so cute and lovely! Then we went into the temple. It was nearly empty! A wonderful temple with lots of great carvings and pillars. The deities were extremely beautiful. We made our pooja, received prasad (blessed food) and could quietly meditated. Finally we sat down on the floor as 2 ladies were singing some bhajans. It was very atmospheric and we enjoyed it very much. After the temple visit we walked around the village which is really small. As the other temple up on the hill was closed around lunch till 5pm we had a lot of time. And it was obvious that there is not much to see and to do in the village. So we first tried to find a place for having lunch. That was quite difficult. We discovered 2 restaurants and some small, dirty street food stalls. As one restaurant was empty and
start of the stairs up to Chamundi Hill
Mysore
did not look very inviting, we went to the New Sampathkumar Restaurant. Some families were having lunch there - a good sign. It was a simple, dark but clean place. There was just one dish: a veg thali. Perfect! No spoons, no fork - it was time to eat with our fingers. And the thali was delicious. And a lot! For less than 2$ we were really full and happy! After lunch we relaxed a bit at the Kalyani. A crew was filming a bollywood movie there and we just watched all the people watching the filming. It was good fun. Finally we walked up the hill to the old Yoganarashima Temple. We still had 1 hour left till the temple opened again. So we sat down, enjoyed the views over Melkote and the surrounding hills, meditated and slept a little bit. Also this temple was beautiful with only few people around. It is a very old temple and really difficult to maintain. All offerings, water and so on has to be carried each day up the steps! I was really worth visiting this village which is far away of the beaten track and it even happened to us that
people blessed each step on their way up to Chamundi Hill
people wanted to touch our skin as they had never seen white people before. ;-)



The bus ride back to Mysore took us again 1,5 hours. We had a last dinner before we packed our backpacks again. It was time to move on. Our next destination: Bangalore!

Gumbaz
the resting place of the legendary Tipu Sultan, his father and his wife
Leaving Hassan after our great day in Shravanabelagola our next destination was Mysore, a city where we have been before (here is our last blog of Mysore). We had an Ok place to stay last time in Mysore but this time we wanted to be a bit closer to town. That is why we ended up in the famous MB International Hotel. It was indeed close to town, just a 10 minutes walk away from the Central bus stand. We were welcomed very friendly - our room was small but looked clean and ok. We were relieved as we had booked 4 nights here. We went for a quick walk around town and a bite to eat for dinner. As we had planned a special trip for the next day, we went to bed early - well, we tried to! When we entered into our room and switched on the lights we saw some small bugs running around in the bed. The very first time on our trips: bedbugs!!!!! We quickly killed the 5 bugs we saw and went down to the reception. They immediately offered us a new room, were very friendly and even helped us to move our unpacked stuff. You can immagine - in the
in the Jamia Masjid
next room we carefully checked the matrasse and the sheets, but everything looked fine. We were just very lucky that we discovered the bedbugs before going to bed! The rest of the night was quiet and bugfree ;-).



The following day we got up early, had a quick breakfast and went down again to the bus stand to catch a bus to Srirangapattana which is about 16 km away from Mysore. You can get on all the Bangalore bound buses which depart like every 5 minutes. So that was easy. After 40 minutes we arrived in Srirangapattana. Our reason for visiting this historical fort town was not its bloody history but the Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple. For the deity of Sri Ranganathna, a manifestation of Mahavishnu (it is the lying form of Narayana) there are only five sacred sites of worship in India. They are together called Pancharanga Kshetram. One of theses places is this temple.



We entered the historical part of town by foot through the fort walls. First we came across the beautiful Jamia Masjid, a cream-coloured mosque with 2 minarets. There, you can walk upstairs and enjoy a nice view over the
washing day at the river
area. Unfortunately the weather was quite cloudy. We kept walking and passed Tipu's place of death (the place where famous Tipu Sultan was found after he had died). It is a peaceful little garden. Close by were the old police headquarters and the Water Gate. We continued our walk to Colonel Bailey dungeon where we sat down at the river observing the locals: kids were playing in the water, women doing some washing, some guys were cleaning themselves and others were washing dishes... From here it was a quick walk to the temple. We bought some offerings for the pooja and went in. Luckily, it was not very crowded. We had to wait in a queue for 20 minutes but without much hassle and much pushing. The temple is really beautiful with a huge statue of Sri Ranganathna. Actually the statue is a manifestation and not made by men! Really impressive! A swami made the pooja for us and we could feel a lot of power and energy this time. We even found some space to quietly sit down and meditate. It was really a wonderful experience. Inside, there was also a temple for Mahalakshmi, the goodess of inner and
Sri Ranganathaswamy Temple
outer wealth and health. We could also do a pooja for her which was amazing. With many blessings and a really great experience we relaxed a little bit in the temple garden. We walked around the temple clockwise 1 time - this burns karma! And it is always good to loose some ;-)...... This was really the first temple, where we quietly could spend our time. Amazing!



After leaving the temple it was time for lunch. As everything is really spread out in Srirangapattana, we took a rickshaw to the Mayura River View Hotel. That was an excellent choice for having lunch. They have a nice terrasse overlooking the holy river Cauvery. The atmosphere was tranquil and peaceful, food was decent and later we could sit along the river and enjoy the sound of frogs. But, as there is more to see, we took the chance to visit some more places. First, Tipu's Summer Palace. It is a nice palace in a beautiful garden. But from the outside it is far less impressive than the Mysore Palace. Anyway, the interior which is made of 90% painted wood, is really amazing. Our last stop of the day was
entrance to the fort town of Srirangapattana
the Gumbaz, where Tipu Sultan is resting together with his father and his wife. The building is amazing and also the nearby mosque Masjid-E-Aska is worth a visit. As we walked to most of the sights we were really tired. We went back to the bus stand by rickshaw and quickly got a bus back to Mysore.



And it was new year's eve! So we had a quick shower and went down to town. There was nothing happening in town for new year's eve. Just some big hotels were having crazy parties where one could spent a lot of money. So we decided to have dinner in the tourist spot: the Parklane Hotel. Food is a bit expensive here, but the atmosphere is nice, the guests were totally mixed (some locals, some tourists) and we met a german lady. We talked, exchanged some travelling stories.... - till finally it was midnight. We welcomed the new year with some ginger tea! Wow, how healthy do we live in the meantime ;-)! The funny thing was that 10 minutes after midnight, the restaurant was closing already. So we even had an early night, as the streets were quiet and
selling fish in the plain heat without cooling
we are happy to be vegetarians...
really nothing was going on. New Year's celebration in Mysore is not a big deal - even the palace was not lightened.



Well, it was a great day to end the year 2014 and a nice and quiet start into 2015. Let's see what the new year has in store for us.... More about our time in Mysore soon...

feet of the Gomateshwara statue in Shravanabelagola
After our ""shithole experience"" in Halebid (read in our last blog entry), we did not feel like staying overnight in another pilgrimage town. Furthermore, the sleeping options in Shravanabelagola sounded, well let's say, limited. Most of the guesthouses are for pilgrims and are rented by the local jain organisation for as little as 210 rupees for a double. So we made the trip to Shravanabelagola from Hassan in 1 day - and it was a perfect decision. But as this place was an extraordinary place for us, we feel like giving it some space in an extra blog.

Why did we chose to go to Shravanabelagola? On this trip we wanted to visit some smaller, remoter places around Mysore as this area is considered to be kind of a holy area with lot of sacred places and a special energy. Shravanabelagola was supposed to be one of these places. It is famous for the huge, 17.5m-high statue of the Jain deity Gomateshvara. The statue is said to be the tallest monolithic one in the world and it is carved out of a single piece of granite.

To get there was quite easy. Well, very, very few western tourists come here, but lots of indian
Markus and some random indians taking pictures of us
ones. Therefore, the bus connections are perfect. From the Hassan bus terminal we took a local bus to Channarayapatna. It was a quick ride of about 40 minutes on the main Mysore-Bangalore highway. In Channarayapatna all signs were only written in Kannada (the local language). Bad luck for us. Also, people do not really speak english here. But somehow we managed to find a local bus to Shravanabelagola. It was another 30 minutes on the bus through beautiful, rural landscape. The whole trip set us back about 1 US$ per person one way - that looked like another really cheap day!

By arriving in Shravanabelagola one can see the huge statue already from far away. The little town is nestled in between two holy hills (Vindhyagiri und Chandragiri), lots of big boulders and some small beautiful lakes. We were much surprised how beautiful it was! We decided first to climb up Vindhyagiri hill where the big statue of Gomateshwara is. Entrance was free (!) but you have to pay a small amount to leave you shoes at the foot of the temple (you must climb the mountain barefoot). The barefoot walk uphill was pleasant beside hordes of school children
landscape around Shravanabelagola
and families constantly asking us for pictures. Next time we will come prepared - we are seriously thinking of wearing a T-shirt saying ""picture - 10 rupee, video - 20 rupee, touching skin - 100 rupee, screaming right into my ear for a picture - 1000 rupee"" ;-)..... Anyway - if you walk up the hill in the warm season at midday, consider wearing some socks as the rock really gets hot. You quickly get an amazing view over town. On the way up, there are some small temples and viewpoints. The statue cannot be seen while walking up. Only by entering the main temple you suddenly stand right in front of the amazing statue of the naked Gomateshvara. Oh yes, although we are in India, the jain deity is completely naked - and yes, you can see everything! No wonder, you can hear a lot of giggeling of school classes, especially with girls only.... whereas most married couples just overlook the detail a bit ashamed. It was very funny to watch the reaction of the people, we have to admit. Anyway, the place has a nice atmosphere and some strong energy around. The statue is amazing. Every 12 years
Markus with Shravanabelagola and Chandragiri hill in the background
there is a Mastakabishekam and millions of people come there. That means that the statue is dowsed in holy waters, yoghurt, kumkum powder etc.. What we have seen on youtube , they need tons and tons of milk and other things. Well, the next ceremony will be in 2018. We enjoyed the place and tried to sit in a more or less quiet corner - but that was nearly impossible. But this is India....

We walked down again and quickly left the stalls and the hassle of the sellers around the entrance behind us. For lunch we tried the Raghu Hotel. This hotel is the only decent sleeping option here. Well, let's say, this time we were glad we had chosen to stay in Hassan! But lunch was more than amazing! They have only jain food, that means, no animal products are used in the food. It is purely vegan. Great for us, as we are strict vegetarians (althouh not vegans). We ordered a thali which was a huge, really tasty and so cheap. The owner was very friendly and chatted with us - well, not a lot of westeners do come here. So he was extremely pleased to
we loved the first aid kits on the buses ;-)
welcome us.

In the afternoon we climbed Chandragiri hill. This hill is nearly deserted. We met 5 people there in the afternoon - not more. It was stunning. We had amazing views of the statue on the other hill, of the town and all the surrounding area. It was so peaceful and quiet!!!! On top is the Chandragupta Basti, a lot of very old jain temples. Actually, these are some of the oldest jain temples in India. The atmosphere was amazing as were the temples. Some of them had a very good energy. Entrance again was free and we visited 11 temples in total and one cave. It was just fantastic and we spend all afternoon there. In the evening we went back to town and took a bus back to Channarayapatna and then to Hassan.

What a cheap an fulfilled day it was! We can highly recommend spending a day in Shravanabelagola. In the evening we had another fantastaic dinner at the Mayura International Hotel in Hassan. Then it was time to pack our backpacks again. Our next destination is a place where we have been already 1 year ago and which we loved: Mysore!

Sharavanbelagola
View from hill top at sharavanbelagola
This blog is dedicated to the Ancient Hoysala Empire - its capital Halebidu and Belur.

28th Dec 2014 sunday morning and a destination 260 kms away from Bengaluru city was picked up as a weekend getaway by us.

We covered total 3 places in a day's tour to belur - Halebidu. Our trip started at 6 am from bengaluru. Our first stop was Sharavanbelagola(140 kms from Bangalore)- a very old jain temple. As soon as we got out of our car we figured out reaching to the temple will not be an easy task, as there were 150 stairs waiting for us. Somehow we managed with 4-5 breaks in between. After reaching the cliff our tiredness was taken away by the temple's design and architecture. After covering the entire courtyard and the temple we quickly rushed down as we were running on a tight schedule.



We then drove another 120 km to reach to the First Hoysala Empire capital - Belur.

Belur: Home to the Hoysala temple complex. The Chennakeshava temple here was completed in 1116 by Hoysala Vishnuvardhana. The temple is 37 meters tall and is standing on a platform which has exquisite art
Belur
Courtyard at Belur - capital of hoyasala
work on its outer walls and bracket figures of dancing girls in various poses in perfect proportion. The temple here is a classic example of Hoysala art, and Belur was one of the Hoysala Capitals. After spending nearly 1.5 hours we still were not able to capture the mind-blowing architecture and sculptures.



Our third and last stop was Halebidu - the later capital of Hoysala.

Halebidu was the regal capital of the Hoysala Empire in the 12th century. It is home to some of the best examples of Hoysala architecture. Most notable are the ornate Hoysaleswara and Kedareswara temples. The city which was originally called Dorasamudra got the name ""Halebidu"" because it was ransacked two times during the invasion of Malik Kafur.

The entire trip got us pretty close to the Hoysala empire and their art forms. while we headed back to Bengaluru city - we had so much to talk about the sculptures and architecture of these places. A must visit place in south India - all 3 destinations can be comfortably covered in a day's time.

paper dosa for breakfast - we loved it.
What a perfect start of the day......
OK, the headline is quite provocative. We do have some indian friends who are spiritual. So please, we do not want to offend anyone. We are just talking about the mass of people and what we observed on our travels. But later some thought on this.



From Madikeri we took one of the many buses down to Hassan. If you want to travel this route: just be warned! The road is really bad and during these 4 hours we were shaken quite a bit. But again we had been lucky, having seats in the front of the bus with great views. We arrived at the bus station in Hassan and were really surprised how clean and well organized this bus station is. As it was early afternoon, we quickly decided to make our way to Halebid. Our plan was to visit the Hoysala temples in Halebid and Belur the following day and we were afraid that we would not make it in one day. So we decided to move on to Halebid to save some time instead of stay in Hassan for the night. Well, to be honest, that was one of the worst decisions we made on
it is orange season - as you can see on the market in Hassan
this trip. The bus ride to Hassan was only 1 hour on a full and dusty bus. We arrived in Halebid and quickly found the only decent hotel in this grab little town, the Mayura Shantala Hotel. Unfortunately, it was fully booked. Really bad luck for us, as there was only one alternative: the Shree Lodge a few meters away. Already from the outside we knew it - that was about to be a horrible experience. But we had no alternative. They had a free room (well, no one is staying there voluntarily) for only 400 Rupees. At least, it was cheap (even though for the shithole we got, we should have paid not more than 100 Rupees). The lodge is about 10 years old, we guessed. When it was new, they put on some bedsheets and never changed them again. The bathroom looked about the same (like being cleaned for the last time about 10 years ago). We just left our stuff there and decided not to spend more time than really necessary in this shithole.



For sunset we went to visit the famous Hoysaleswara Temple. The temple was full of people especially school classes. But
construction work in a bus terminal near Hassan
it is really impressive and beautiful. The construction of the temple began around 1121 and went on for 190 years. It was never really completed. But still today the temple is a masterpiece of Hoysala architecture. The outside walls of the temple are richly sculpted and are covered with Hindu deities, sages, stylised animals and Hoysala rulers. There are also 2 statues of Nandis (Shiva's bull) facing the inner sanctum of the temple. The whole temple is in the middle of a nice and well kept garden. It would have been wonderful and we could feel a very good energy in the temple. The only problem were the hordes of school classes and families. The closer we went to the inner sanctum of the temple, the louder they became. For us, a temple is a place for meditation, a place of peace. For 99% of the visitors the visit to the temple was a big event. They spoke loudly, took pictures and always asked us for pictures. One moment, I was kneeing down in front of the main deity for praying, some guys were standing beside me asking me for a picture. It opened our eyes to the fact, that

India is indeed a holy country. But there are not more spiritual people in India than in the rest of the world. They are born Hindus, they obey to the religious rules and ceremonies, but they are definitely not more or less spiritual than other people. We were kind of shocked. In fact it was really annoying as we could not find a place to quietly sit for a while and taking it all in. We tried to loudly recitate some mantras - but people were ignorant to that. They kept asking us for pictures, pushing us, shouting at us all the time. In a far corner of the garden they finally left us in peace. We sat there and thought about the indians, their religion and their lifes.



Some of our thoughts to India and religion: as we had experienced especially in Kerala, a very conservative part of India, people try everything to fullfill the social norm. They do not show any kind of emotions. Still, 90% of the marriages are arranged and especially younger people are extremely unhappy with that. But the fear of being an outsider of society and the fear of not fulfilling
traffic jam - view from the bus
the karma is to big to change the situation. Oh yes, they think, obeying their parents and getting married to a random woman/man is their karma. But this is only society pressure. And this again is caused by the way religion is lived today. Spirituality goes beyond this. In spirituality one follows the heart. Because the heart is never wrong. It maybe wrong in concern of the society rules but not for oneself. Of course, this is the more difficult way as one has to face his own problems and his own decisions. Anyway, this is a thinking most of the people do not understand (or they do not want to hear that). We met some people on our trip who already have realised this problem of the society and who have solved it for themselves. They opened their hearts, made their own decisions and are highly spiritual people (and we are not talking about some saints or gurus, just ""normal"" people). Some of them nearly never go to temples as it is always to loud, to crowded and full of people not caring for others. They agreed to our thoughts. One wonderful lady even said: ""It is crazy. In
Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
India, we live in a holy country. And all the people want to go to the gym, train in Zumba, drink and party. And all the westeners come here and bring us back the spirituality. They look for peace of mind, they visit temples in a way, they do yoga and eat real ayurvedic food."" The world is indeed crazy. Just some thoughts......



Back to our trip. As the sun was setting down, we left the temple and went for a walk around Halebid town. Well, this was done in 10 minutes as it is mainly just one dusty main street. There is another, very colourful temple, the Kedareswara Temple, which was quite peaceful and nice to visit. That's it. So Markus decided to take the time for a haircut in one of the streetside shacks. For 60 Rupees he got a perfect cut and the time was coming closer when the only restaurant in the big hotel opened. We had dinner (it was quite ok) and then went back to our awful room. We put our sarongs on the bed and did not even get undressed. It was one of these moments when you try not
details of the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
to touch anything. The flush of the toilet was not working anymore. But luckily we did not need it too much anyway. ;-) The night nevertheless was ok, we slept well. We got up the next morning very early as we wanted to escape out of our room quickly. At that time we even did not have any running water at all. We just put the few things we unpacked together and left at 6 am. From the bus terminal we took the first bus to Belur. It was about 40 minutes. There we went to Mayura Velapuri Hotel for having a nice breakfast. It was delicious and we could even wash ourselves in the bathroom. Luckily, we could leave our luggage there while visiting the temple. We were happy again.



And off we went to the Channakeshava Temple. On our way we realised that Belur is much bigger and much more pleasant than Halebid. We should have stayed here. Well, sometimes you make stupid decisions.... The temple was simply stunning and even worth spending the night in a shithole for it. In fact, there are different smaller temples around the main temple. It was also very
details of the Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
crowded. But most of the people and school classes just visited the main temple. Like this, the other temples were peaceful and quiet. We spend a lot of time in the temples and could even meditate without being disturbed. Again, the architecture was stunning. The carvings and scultpures on the walls left us speachless. In some smaller temples ceremonies were going on and visitors even got blessings. Wonderful.



Finally, we took our backpacks from the hotel and went to the bus station again. It was 1 hour by bus till we reached Hassan. From there we took a rikhshaw that brought us to the Mayura International Hotel . We had read good reviews about it on tripadvisor. As the prize was reasonable we just gave it a try. It was like entering into paradies for us. They had a huge and cheap room available. As it was quite cold a night we did not need an AC room, so it was even cheaper. Everything was well kept and extremely clean. The towels were not stained, the bedsheets nicely white (!) and the bathroom had a wonderful hot shower. It was the first ""normal"" (that means no bucket shower) hot
Hoysaleswara Temple in Halebid
shower after 4,5 weeks! Wow!!!!! After the previous night we felt like kings. We showered, washed all our stuff and went down to the restaurant for lunch. Another surprise. This restaurant was excellent! Never before did we have such a great variety of freshly cooked, vegeterian indian food. And sooooo tasty! Later, we discovered that a lot of well-off families from Hassan come here for eating as well. Well, accomodation is sometimes a lottery while travelling. This time, we got the jackpot. We went for a walk around Hassan. There is nothing to see in Hassan but it is ok for some cheap shopping. Later, we had more wonderful food for dinner before we simply relaxed in our room.



To some it up: the temples in Halebid and Belur are worth a visit. But base yourself in Hassan and make a daytrip. Both temples can easily be visited in 1 day.



The next day we made a day trip to the pilgrimage town of Sravanabelagola. More about this in another blog....

Day 8
We had a relaxed morning this morning; waking up naturally, which was a refreshing change! Although we were awoken in the night by a random phone call. I answered it half asleep. It was all in Indian, I just kept replying that I didn't understand, but he continued to rabble on. Very frustrating, T found it very funny! lol
We packed our bags ready to move on again. We met with Kate and Nicola for our final breakfast before parting our ways. It was a hearty English breakfast this morning, well, as English as it gets in India! Cereal, fruit, toast with jam and tea.
We set of for Bangalore, which is abut 150k. We have a couple of stops on the way.
The first stop was after only 10 minutes whilst still in Mysore. It was at a beautiful Catholic Church. We weren't allowed inside as the service had already started, but the doors were open, it was amazing inside, as well as outside.
Then back in the car for 15km to the Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary. We saw lots of varieties of birds on our boat trip in the sanctuary, and a few crocodiles, although only from a
image
distance. Before leaving we fit in one last palace, The Palace of Tipu Sultan.
In Bangalore, we leave Kate and Nicola, they are getting the sleeper bus to Goa, whereas Tom and I are getting a local bus to Chennai. We will stay there overnight before flying to Goa the following day, my birthday!
With Nijams help we found the correct sleeper bus to Chennai. We arrived safely in Chennai.... Early! It was quite an experience waiting in the rain for Muhto to find us, which he did about an hour later. We arrived at our, very nice looking hotel, then went straight to our room. We sat for a couple of hours, just chatting, drinking tea, and putting the world to rights. Another good day!

Day 7
Today was a 5.15 start. We have agreed that we should take a second chance on the safari. The same driver came to pick us up from the hotel. We did manage to see various wildlife, but not the one's we really wanted to see; elephants, tigers, and leopards. The road through the park was really far too busy. Still, it was a beautiful morning, and a nice way to spend 3.5 hours.
On our return to the hotel, we were running a bit late, so we had no time for a wash, or a shower, it was bags packed, and away.
Today we are driving 90km to Mysore. The first stop was for breakfast; dosa and tea all round. We were all ready for it. The owner seemed very pleased that we had chosen to eat at his cafe. He served out dosas like hats!
The first part of the journey was back through the safari park, we managed to see a few black faced monkeys.
Before we go to be hotel in Mysore, Nijam took us to visit Mysore Palace. The first thing we saw inside, apart from the absolute hoards of people, pushing and shoving, was
image
the Shree Shvetha Varaha Swamy Temple. We all had audio guides, I only really took two points on board, that the palace was but in the
Wodeyar Dynasty, and their most favoured God was Chamundeshwari.
After arriving at the hotel we got showered and changed before heading off to see the Sri Chamundeshwari Temple, the bull temple and then the market. At the temple we had yet another round of photos with a Westerner! Tom has finally bought two dodis. Seeing him pluck up the courage to wear them will be interesting. We completed the day by having dinner at The Ritz. Another good day.

young monk at Bylakuppe
No, we did not pay for this picture! ;-). This guy was just cute and happy that we took a picture of him.
Leaving Kannur in the direction of Madikeri, I (Nina) had to face a special challenge. After having changed my ayurvedic medicine the evening before (as prescribed by the doctors), I had quite a strong diarrhea. As I felt healthy and ok, I did not pay much attention to it, but a 6 hour bus journey was not really what I was looking for. Anyway, we were lucky. Being the first ones on the bus, we were sitting in prime position in the front row with a perfect view. After 1 hour of travelling, we realised that theses seats were essential for a good journey. The driver was driving like crazy and the road was really curvy. The result: we were nearly the only one not feeling sick and not in need of some sickness bags. Instead we were enjoying the drive up the Western Ghats. As the bus had no windows anyway and the engine was very noisy, we did not even hear or smell that the co-passengers were all doing really miserable. Even my colon was quiet. Luck was on our side this time.



After nearly 6 hours we arrived in the dusty town of Madikeri which
Bylakuppe - in the smaller temple
is nestled in between beautiful rolling hills. The landscape looked amazing. We went out to look for a rickshaw and easily got one to a fair prize to get to our final destination: the Rainforest Retreat , an ecolodge tucked away in the forest. The ride on the rickshaw was nearly 1 hour and really bumpy (which woke up my colon and I had to train some specific muscles ;-)). But it was worth it. We arrived at the remote lodge. Our small and rustic cottage was a 15 minute walk away from the dining area and the middle of nowhere. We had our own fireplace in the room, an outdoor bathroom (the first thing I saw in the cottage). We got hot water for the shower by heating a huge bowl of water on the open fire (there is a solar panel solution, but we did not have enough sun those days) - and then it was a bucket shower. GREAT - and a real adventure. All the food is grown biologically on the farm - and one can taste this. Everything was so delicious. But still - there was one problem: my diarrhea. After dinner it got really bad
hiking in Coorg
and because of all my surgeries some years ago, I got quickly dehitrated. As we were really remote in the forest, I decided to be safe and go to the hospital as I did not know why I had this problem. I driver of the lodge took us there. Well, it was a private hospital and the first thing I thought was: ""oh my good, I do not want to see a public hospital then...."". I had to lay down on a bed which, well, more than stained. The doctor came in quickly wearing a battle dress. No angel in white - this guy was ready for a fight! It made me laugh. But he was friendly, checked me and said: you must stay here for the night. Well, I first wanted to know what my problem was. His quick answer was: food poisoning. OK, finally we agreed that I could take some medicine especially for the dehidration and we went back to the lodge. I really did not feel sick enough to stay in this place. After returning and taking the medicine, I quickly felt better and had a good sleep. Some days later I discovered that the cause
Coorg flower
of my problems was not food poisoning at all. My poor stomach simply did not like a specific ayurvedic tablet - that was all. So, all problems solved and after a tough start in the Coorg we finally could enjoy this wonderful place.

The first day we took it really easy. A nice breakfast with homemade bread, curries, idly, fresh fruits and self-crown tea was followed by some hammock time. After a wonderful lunch (I was feeling much better at that time) we went for a walk around the hills of the lodge before we enjoyed a nice bonfire. At night it was getting freezing cold (around 0-10 degrees). We had not been really prepared for this, but the open fire helped a lot. The other guests were a great mixture of indians and westeners and we were all talking and exchanging our stories. These evenings were really like what travelling is all about. Wonderful! This was christmas eve. We slept to the sound of frogs, crickets, wild dogs and other animals. What can you wish more for christmas!

The following day, christmas day, we had our own driver who took us to Bylakuppe where the Golden Temple
coconut seller near Iritty
on the way from Kannur to Madikeri in the Western Ghats
and the buddhist monastry is. It was cheaper, faster and easier to have our own driver than to take a riskshaw to town and a bus to Kushalnagar and another rickshaw to Bylakuppe. And, we could also go and visit other places with our own driver as well - so, no question what to do. It was kind of funny to celebrate christmas in the buddhist temple together with hordes of indian tourists. The monastry was stunning and had a great energy. The temples were so beautiful! It took us quite some time to leave the place again. On our way back we stopped at the Abbi Falls, a nice but not really spectacular waterfall near Madikeri, before we had lunch in Madikeri. After lunch we headed to the Rajas Seat, a nice garden overlooking the hills and Madikeri. It was a bit too crowded for our taste. Finally we also visited the oldest temple of the region, the Omkhareshwara Temple, in the heart of Madikeri. It is a beautiful and really well maintained temple. Even non-Hindus were allowed to participate in the ceremony. So we got darshan (blessing). We ended the day with a visit at a small and
our bus drivers seat
and this was a good one!
hidden temple in the sacred forest. This temple a a really powerful energy and the surroundings were so peaceful. Overmore, no one was around, we were the only ones. It was a perfect day which ended with a wonderful dinner and lots of laughing with the other guests.

On our last day we went on a guided hike (it was included in the accomodation). It was a beautiful 3 hour hike up a hill with stunnning views. This part of India is wonderful and so far away of the hassle, the noise and the pollution. We loved every second. After a big lunch we relaxed in the hammocks for the rest of the day. We did not really want to leave the following day. Just the cold and the humidity at night was really getting to us and we had no spare clothes left. So after 4 nights we left paradies for a warmer climate.

Many thanks to Dave, Laurie, Sujata and the rest of the Rainforest crew who made our stay so wonderful and who took great care of us!

gorkarna
So it's another bus ride from Hampi to Gorkarna, luckily I'm making the journey with a friend I've made in Hampi. There was no sleeper tickets available for the bus, so I'm sat upright all night trying to fucking sleep! No chance! We have to change bus at 2AM, and get onto what from the outside was a minivan, inside they'd managed to cram as many seats as a small airplane, goodbye knees. What I didn't realise before starting the journey was that it's only two hours on from this point, so we pay an extra 100rs each to get dropped at Om beach, meant to be really quiet and so named because it's in the shape of the Om symbol. We arrive in Gorkarna around 4/4.30AM, it's still dark and there's no one around. Collectively everyone off the bus decides to walk down to the beach, await sunrise and find a room, sounds nice, but when you're tired, not so much. Not to mention streets, beaches, pretty much everywhere is owned by the dogs at night. In most places they're just roaming around the cities, eating rubbish and whatever food westerners give them, Indians usually treat them like shit and beat them, which is probably why they're so unpredictable, you hear stories of people getting fucking bitten by them! Most of the time though, they'll just bark at you until you get off their territory, still rather unnerving though.



Anyway, I get a room at Sunset point, probably the best view on the beach 300rs a night, which seemed reasonable until the last night when I noticed fucking cockroaches crawling all over the place!

The beach in Gorkarna is so nice! there's another round the corner, Kudlee beach, I wish I'd had time to visit, but I was only there for two nights. On the second day I got a kayak with some friends, 300rs for two hours. There's two secluded beaches that are only accessible via the sea, or climbing over rocks. Half Moon beach and Paradise beach, basically places where the hippies go and stay in tents, build there own leaf shacks, cook their own food and sit playing guitar, fucking douches!. A few years ago the police came down and demolished all the buildings that were there, so I wasn't expecting to find anything. We pull the Kayaks up onto Half moon beach, and there's a couple of stone buildings, and no one about.....very strange. We're looking around and there's every sign of life, apart from life. Very creepy, it was like something from the start of a horror movie!
We quickly get off Half moon and round to Paradise, which is fucking over exaggerating the beach! I'm rowing the kayak in and a wave comes and nearly fucking capsized me! fuck sake.
There's just a few hippies sat around, I wasn't staying there long!
The beach really reminds me of what ""The Beach"" (the book) would be like.



Literally just spent the day swimming in the sea and lounging on the beach, the seas really calm, so perfect for swimming. The waves break really late, it's so trippy to watch, it looks like it just stops all of a sudden.

Now to Thrissur to meet Anu (from the Raleigh project that I volunteered with last year)!

hampi
The journey to Hampi entailed my first bus ride in India. The bus is none A/C so it's hot as fuck! The beds are pretty uncomfy and it's pretty hard to sleep because the bus is rocking everywhere, turning corners, stopping etc! Definitely need to stick to the train in future. When I first get on the bus, I find my bed, and it's like the size of a normal single, but I'm meant to be sharing it with someone, turns out to be some European chick. Her and her friend have been separated and her friend's got a full bed to herself...So of course, I do the chivalrous thing and offer to swap with her friend, so as to avoid the awkward situation of having to sleep next to a randomer, fuck that! and to get my own full bed. I assume the beds are set up in this way because Indians don't have the same discomfort with invading strangers personal space, as evidenced by their queueing.

I arrive in Hampi, I'm not really sure what to expect, the only things I really know is that it was an old kingdom and meant to be fucking class!. Turns out Hampi is actually just a small town, surrounded by the old kingdom, temples, palaces everywhere etc. There's 2000 temples in Hampi! Not a sniff of me visiting all of them!

Hampi is essentially the Rome of India, the kingdom there was very rich and powerful, they conquered most of south India in their time and had trading routes with Rome, China...etc, and they're still excavating to find more ruins. Some people I met there likened it to Ankgor Wat in Cambodia.

I find a guest house ""Funky Monkey"", really good stay! 250rs a night, fucking class food! The best Thali (Indian dish with Chapatis, two curries, rice and a pudding) I've ever had! The guy running the show, Shiva, is a really cool guy, dead sound.

The first day I wandered to the main temple, I meet an Indian man (Krishna) who works in the tourist office as a guide, he's giving me a free map (which turns out to be a photo copied piece of shit which you can't read, no wonder it's free), and explains the route I should walk from Hampi up to the Vitthala temple (The apparent main attraction in Hampi), I also organise to go with a tour group with Krishna the day after, 450rs they hire a push iron (bicycle) for you, Krishna comes with you as the guide and you go round the southern part of Vijayanagar, 3km away.

Walking away from the temple, and this is the case with every main temple in Vijayanagar, there's like a long continuous room with pillars stretching the length from one temple to the next, 750M, this is what used to be the bazaar (Indian market), on the bottom floor they used to sell gold, diamonds, precious stones...etc. At night they used to cover the gold etc with a sheet and leave it there, and no one would steal it! Imagine that today!. On the top floor they sold flowers, looking at the worn down, decrepit looking buildings it's hard to imagine people selling gold there, but this was 500 years ago!

The next thing I come to is fucking amazing! It's the Achyutharaya temple (meaning Karma-sutra temple), if you're in Hampi definitely check this out! This, for me, was the best thing I saw! I don't think many people visit because there was no one around, and I went there twice. Overgrown grass on the floor, walking around was fucking enchanting! It felt like I was walking around somewhere I wasn't supposed to be, but it also kinda had the same feeling as walking around Liverpool castle up Rivi at the same time, definitely would be a good place for a rave.

Up to the Vitthala temple, 250rs to get in? Fuck that. I use the extremely good zoom on my camera, climb up to a vantage point on top of the bazaar and get pictures of the inside.

The tour the day after was class! Met some cool people too, really good to walk around the temples and actually know what things are, and it makes it way more interesting once you know the history behind things. The tour takes you past the biggest statue of Ganesh in I think India, but maybe just the south, I can't remember. The statue is broken from when the Muslims laid siege to the kingdom, which was the eventual end of Vijayanagar, they went round and smashed loads of temples and statues etc, hence why most things are in ruins. We then go a slightly smaller statue of Ganesh, this was for the public, the other for the royal family. This statue of Ganesh is unique because it's the only one in India that shows Parvati (Ganesh's mum) around the back of him with her arms reaching round, which is why he has four arms. Then down to a statue of Shiva, which was also destroyed by the muslims, but the historians excavating Hampi attempted to fix it with plaster, they did a decent job....apart from building his legs crossed rather than one being down, they're now banned from trying to fix any statues haha. Just on a side note, on this trip I've realised Shiva is a mother fucking gansta! He's regularly depicted holding/smoking a chillum (what Indians use to smoke weed) and he's the god of destruction, so he goes about killing people. Maybe religion in the West would be more appealing if god was this cool!

It's 250rs to get into the main palace complex, where only woman used to be allowed in as it was the queens resting quarters, basically just more ruins. Although there's small building which the queen used for dancing, which has ancient A/C built into it! Some clever fuck came up with the idea that if you run pipes through the walls and then fill them with water, somehow it works like A/C, unfortunately I don't know the science behind that!. Most of southern Vijayanagar's ruins are exactly that, just foundations in the floor. BUT! the ticket for the palace complex also works at the Vitthala temple on the same day! Spot on. The Vitthala temple actually turned out to be pretty cool so I'm glad I went, there's a stone chariot in there which is like the main thing to see in Hampi, it doesn't roll, obviously.

Next day I hire a push iron (bicycle for none northerners) 50rs for the day, and head across the river to Anegondi and Virupapuragadda, 20rs at the river crossings for you and the bike, they take you across on a little boat. Anegondi isn't as the guide book describes it, it's a small village, most of the things the guide book suggests to see are fucked. The palace, which the guide book says is still intact is actually more or less burned to the ground, and the temples aren't really worth seeing. The ride from Anegondi to Hanuman's temple is beautiful, surrounded by cotton fields and banana plantations, and of course the amazing landscape of the whole area.

Thousands of years ago the whole area was under water, which is what makes the rocks all like boulders, it's so strange to see, it looks like something from Star Trek! It appears to be piles of boulders in random areas, but they're ""mountains"" (nothing is a mountain to me anymore) made from rocks, and because it's been under water, the water has shaped the rocks this way. Some of the boulders are perched so precariously on top of each other! They look like they're going to tumble down and fucking crush you at any second!.

The view from Hanuman's temple is out of the world, the landscape of the area, with the temples dotted about is amazing! Truly one of the best views I've had on the trip, and that's saying something!

Virupapuragadda is basically a small village on the other side of the river to Hampi, I come back this way so I can complete a loop, you can also stay on this side of the river, and in hindsight that would've been the better option. Upon arrival at Hampi, I assumed there wouldn't be anyone over the other side of the river, but it turns out most people are actually staying on this side, it's quieter, nicer looking, more chilled out and the added benefit that you can buy alcohol, which is illegal in Hampi as far as I'm aware...There looked to be so many cool people to meet over there too! Fuck! Definitely next time.

I spend the last day just lounging around. Now, off to Gokarna and the beach for some much needed rest...haha.

DSC_0458
is looking more beautiful because it is a pleasant morning and also it is Sunday but in evening it is crowded. After exploring some time and eating a delicious burger at mac-Donald I leave for bus stop.after 5 minutes my friends also reach there.we choose brigade road because of seats (it the starting point of that buss) .It is around 40 min journey (33-kms).It is our first time through that route we are exited the best thing about Bangalore is its climate and because of climate it became a joy ride with friends and after 15 minutes IIM Bangalore passed ,we looked each other and one friend commented NAHI HO PAYENGA.

Buss stop is clean and bigger (it is located at outskirts of Bangalore) compare to other stops.As we plain so we now it is going to be along day So we headed for breakfast first.There is a canteen inside the campus (or you can also eat inside zoo,lots of stalls inside). We order parotha (15rs per) and dosa(10rs per).parotha is not good ,if you are a
DSC_0463
Zoo Elephants
north Indian you are going to think why they call it parotha(it is terrible).Dosa is OK (before coming here I know only dosa which is filled with potato(aloo)but hundreds of verities are available.After breakfast we headed towards safari ,there are also ticket counters there so you can buy tickets on the spot.
We move toward safari whose entrance is just before ticket counter, if your are coming from buss stop direction.So he took our ticket and cut it from end ,we are finally in.we cross a lawn between that we can see lots of foreigners with there kids and as always they charge more from them but later we found they also get good seats.
We take our seats in bus(seats are based on first come priority). you don’t need to rush because all seats are good and you are going to get your share of view.
Its around 10:15 am. Initially you will feel you are in some kind of village. but when you enter into the 1st gate you will find it is quite real damn real (its gates is like gate in Jurassic park movie).there are 2 doors.1st door open ,we enter after it get
IMG_20140907_104804614
closed than 2nd door will open and you enter in the main area(good amount of security).

Its around 10:15 am.

Bear Safari
We are on the last seat, we are concern about the view the something happens.We got the glimpse of a black bear .every one is rushed to see him(him or her I don’t know my gender knowledge is limited only to cows & dogs).Then we see a whole big bear. I am using whole because it is really big. He is lying on the ground(like a dead) and my friend commented he is in love and every body laughed .but again we got some bears lying continuously in the same position.(just in 10 meter region) there is no movement in them. we start to think they are models and real bears are
DSC_0474
still going to come and just 40 second after we see group of bears moving identical to each other. we then again start to think they are costumes and some one is inside that acting like a bear and we expresses ourselves loud. full buss start to laugh including buss driver and it is just a matter of moments we can see whole area full of bears they are very close, big, fantastic, real beautiful.

Some bears are concern about our presence some are veteran they don’t care. As one bear is start moving in front of our buss ,two of them start moving we the buss. people start clicking photos. We are all exited .After some time moving along the bear buss make a way and we just cross the exit gate of bear safari.

Lion Safari:
We entered into the zone by same Jurassic park like gate. Just in 2 minutes we find our self in between group of Lions. you can feel the presence of king. They are big. some of them are with there lioness (I don’t know about that lioness to which lion she belongs).
Here we can easily see the difference(lioness with
DSC_0489
LION king
hairs).they don’t care about our presence they are setting like kings and give expressions like –I don’t care if you are human or anyone I know you can’t do anything, its like two lions are talking with each other.
Lion1- Look humans.
Lion2-Ignore them ,they are regular.
And we are feeling that we are not here to see them. Actually it’s a human safari for Lions.
Look look a lion is very near to my window. I feel like I can touch him. but it is not possible and even it needs guts to do that.1st time I am that close it is intimidating ,exciting Wow!. At that time I am just there, not thinking about anything, just constantly starring at him only. After these we enter into the tiger safari

Tiger safari:

Same type of gate, All in our bus is constantly starring a tiger near our bus .you can easily absorb the alertness in his walk. He is not looking you but he is looking you, he is so present ,so deadly. His beauty is enhance more when you absorb his shades of his body
. All intimidating stories about sunder ban(West Bengal) ,all stories about
DSC_0494
Lioness
tiger, how they hunt (discovery channel).how much they show patient, all these things is moving inside my mind. Specialty about these park is that they have both normal and white tigers.
There are only 1700-1800 total tiger in India now. They are super animal, they climb, swim, jump and by these experience I get my answer why they are national animal.
After Watching tigers glory. we went out outside safari zone and our next destination is butterfly park.

Butterfly park:
After 50 minutes of Safari we head toward butterfly park. The most latest addition in beauty of bunnergutta national park. It is quite beautiful it is started in 2005.A beautiful statue of butterfly is made outside the park and you get surprise when you go inside. Area is full of butterflies. Some butterfly can come and seat on you
They are just like stars every where .Structure is also beautiful(dome shape).As you move inside ,you can absorb that pound and other stuff made to enhance the beauty. We spend half an hour and then we move inside information center. There you will get all information about the types of butterfly present there and also you get to know how
IMG_20140907_105919871
butterfly grows. It is good, you can go with your kids.

ZOO:
After that we went for Zoo. Zoo is large in area. But we can find lots of varieties of species, specially if you are interested in Snakes and tortoise. Some snakes are quite big and some turtles are very small. We also find ostrich is a real surprise.
Things to Remember
1. Try to reach early.
2. It is good if you take food with you, Don’t expect much in terms of food
3. Check your watch before going for boating because they promise more and give you less

Thing I absorb in animals
TIGER-Alertness
LION-fearlessness, confidence.

Best of luck and Enjoy.

November 12th 2014
Published: November 24th 2014


Temple at Chamundi hills
Mysore is a mesmerising ancient city of palaces in South India. I started off the journey on 12Th of Nov at around 8 in the night by bus along with a bunch of energetic and enthusiastic chumps. On Thursday morning, we checked in at Ashirwadh Hotel and straight away went to explore the Zoological Garden which was interestingly set up in around 8-10 acres within an exquisite bandstand. The zoo authorities do not allow one to carry plastics and food items as part of their new project scheme ,which means that , we had a tiring time covering the entire zoo being thirsty.But the zoo invited us to a fascinating planet altogether.This planet not only contained varied varieties of animals, but also beautiful walk throughs surrounded by natural vegetation, wide range of flora and fauna, and many rare species .Devika and I , even though two nature buffs , we found it a mammoth task to reach the exit point. We sauntered quiet too fast while the rest from my gang was indulged in clicking the wildlife. We then set out to visit the magnificent and the most opulent Mysore palace known as Amba Vilas Palace. The beauty of palace is
Tippu's Jamia masjid
beyond my words can possibly encompass. It's corridors, antiques made of gold, silver ,and ivory, the majestic domes , chandeliers, the whole architectural elements were all very much awe- inspiring. One can never take their eyes off from it's colourful and intricate paintings the covers both the walls and ceilings of the palace with its rich detail about the myths, tales of war and love with its essence of Hindu-Islam Rajput fusion . We girls got highly jealous of the wodeyar rulers for their lavishness and luxury, but the sad part was that we were not allowed cameras inside the palace so as to capture the royal moments. After a small siesta, we wriggled our way up to the Chamundi Hills.This place apart from being the area of the oldest temple , it the prime view point where one can see the whole of Mysore City. The night view , when the entire city is illuminated is something never to be missed. We girls got on top of a narrow parapet beside the road to get hypnotised in the bright and mind blogging scene in the panorama. Some of the us were too crazy to stand over the narrow parapet and to click the risky and dangerous selfies so as to outdo others in Facebook. After a chilly frozen venturing to the hilltop gulping down pani puris and hot teas, we returned and crashed onto our beds as quickly so as to wake up for yet another adventurous royal visits to Tippu palace and monastery. The Tippu Sulthan's Summer palace is comparatively less luxurious, situated within large area and is simple with its wooden architecture and faded paintings in its inside which is worth visiting. We then travelled another couple of hours to Coorg to experience the exciting White water Rafting . We jumped into to the rafts with few experts for a secured adventure paddling. The most memorable part of the rafting was whirling the raft and jumping into the river out of sheer excitement. After getting fully soaked we decided to go for musical night party amidst coconut farm and trees to recharge our batteries. We bunch of girls were banging our heads and tapping our foot with the rhythm of disco lights and DJ music giving a final touch to our adventurous trip.

Gate of India, Mumbai
Hi all



Well we got togged up and enjoyed a very nice drink in the rather plush Harbour Bar at the lavishly beautiful Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Mumbai. If only we'd checked Booking.com earlier as much to our surprise the room rate was pretty reasonable so we could have treated ourselves to a night's stay. Hey ho we will do next time as we certainly intend to visit India again as we're loving it so much.



We spent 3 full and rather crazy days in Mumbai over the Diwali Festival. It was extremely busy, wonderfully colourful as many of the properties were decorated in fairy lights and so very noisy with fireworks being let off all the time. The sheer volume of people was a little overwhelming at times - the population of Mumbai is 18.4 million and there were thousands of visitors in town for the festival.



We dd manage to see the following attractions though:-

- Prince of Wales Museum, Mumbai's biggest and best museum which opened in 1923 and displays a great mix of exhibits from all over India.

- The Gateway of India, a huge
Taj Mahal Palace Hotel
As seen on TV. Our place was one road back, but a world away!
basalt arch facing out to Mumbai Harbour. It was actually built to commemorate the 1911 royal visit of King George V but was not completed until 1924. Nowadays it's a favourite gathering spot for locals and a top spot for people watching.

- St Thomas' Cathedral, a charming building begun in 1672 and finished in 1718. It's the oldest English building in Mumbai - a marriage of Byzantine and colonial-era architecture.

- The High Court, an elegant 1848 neo-Gothic building the design of which was inspired by a German castle. Sadly for us it was closed over the Diwali Festival as we'd have loved to have seen inside too.

- Victoria Terminus, Mumbai's most extravagant Gothic building (added to Unesco World Heritage list in 2004) and the beating heart of its railway network. It was completed in 1887 and today is Asia's busiest train station.

- Elephana Island, another Unesco Heritage site and an hour's boat ride away from Mumbai Harbour, home to a labyrinth of cave-temples carved into the island's basalt rock that contain some of India's most impressive temple carving. The temples are thought to date from AD 450 to AD 750. The island

was originally known as Gharapuri (Place of Caves) but the Portuguese called it Elephanta because of a large stone elephant near the shore.





We flew from Mumbai to Goa on 26 October - just a short 1 hr 5 min flight away but felt like we'd landed on a paradise island! Wow what a fab part of India. Beautiful scenery, so lush and green, fabulous golden sandy beaches and the warm Arabian sea - a real tonic for the soul. We chose to stay way down South in Palolem and very pleased we did as it was a lovely quiet resort with a wonderful bay. We enjoyed 3 days of rest & relaxation there. It was very hard to leave but our time in India is running out fast.





From Goa we flew to Bangalore (short 1hr 10min trip) and then took a cab onto Mysore which we'd expected to take 4 hours but had omitted to take into account the rush hour in Bangalore so ended up being nearly 6 hours. We'd only planned to stay in Mysore for a night or 2 but ended up staying there 4

Not bad for a train station
nights as we liked it so much. It's said that if you haven't been to Mysore then you just haven't seen South India. It's one of the most flamboyant places in India and is known for its glittering royal heritage, bustling markets, magnificent monuments, cosmopolitan culture and friendly people. Whilst here we visited:-

- Mysore Palace, a jaw-droppingly stunning richly decorated palace. It was the former seat of the Wodeyar Maharajas. The old palace was gutted by fire in 1897, the one you can see now was completed in 1912 by English architect Henry Irwin. Highlights for us were the Private and Public Durbar Halls', the Marriage Pavilion (a lavish hall used for royal weddings) and the numerous fabulous oil paintings. It's a feast for the eyes as everywhere you look you see the most ornately carved teak and rosewood doors and ceilings and amazing stained and painted glass ceilings. Unfortunately cameras are not allowed inside. Luckily for us we also got to see the palace lit up which happens for one hour every Sunday and on public holidays.

- Mysore Zoo, which was brilliant and we're sure has much higher standards then we suspect most zoos do
Victoria Terminus, Mumbai
Looks more like cathedral
in India. It's set in pretty gardens that date from 1892 and highlights included the big cats (especially the white tigers), rhinos, Indian & African elephants and giraffes.

- Chamund Hill, on its summit of 1,062m stand the Sri Chamundeswari Temple which is dominated by a towering 40m high entrance gateway. We queued with thousands of locals to get into the temple to be blessed. There are also fabulous views up here over the city.

- Jayachamar Art Gallery which is housed in the Jaganmohan Palace that was built in 1861 as the royal auditorium. The gallery contains a collection of kitsch objects and royal memorabilia of the Mysore Royal family.

- Rail Museum, open-air with main exhibit being the Mysore Maharani's saloon (a wood-panelled beauty dating from 1899). There are 6 steam engines you can climb aboard and pretend to be the driver - great for kids of all ages. Worryingly we noticed one of the engines was 2 years younger than us!

- St Philomena's Cathedral built between 1933 and 1941 in neo-Gothic style with beautiful stained glass windows.

While we were in Mysore there were some parades going on which we later
Elephanta Island
Big rock carvings hey!
discovered were to celebrate its name changing to Mysuru.



We're now making our way down to Kerala where we plan to spend our last week in India.



Happy thoughts from India.

Lots of love, Trev & Verity xx

Nagarhole national park
Beware of those bushes, who knows what comes out of it?
By Vishnu.

Have you ever Coorghed? If you haven’t, do it now. It doesn’t matter whom you go with- its a place of Liveliness, happiness and craziness. Very recently, I (Vishnu) traveled to Coorgh with six of my besties in Innova. Due to the long weekend (October 2nd to October 6th, 2014), Coorgh would obviously be crowded, but my experience was amazing nonetheless. It all started on October 2nd. I started with six of my friends from Bangalore (they deserve to be named here- Harsha, Varma, Roopesh, Chaitanya, Anil and Muni.)

Our trip started at around 11 in the morning after a small McDonald’s brunch on the way to Mysore. We reached Mysore at around 3'o clock (we underestimated the traffic, because of the long weekend.) We also had lunch at Parklane hotel in Mysore; they served good biryani, despite a late serving time.



We intended to reach our stay point (near Kutta) by nightfall, which was 100km from Mysore. In the route map we saw that we have to pass through the Nagarhole National Park (a stretch of deep forest and animal sanctuary for 52 km), which we later found out that the forest department
Deer Sightings
Thank god, their prey isn't here!
won’t allow any vehicles into the forest after 6pm. We had to race to reach the gates of the Nagarhole forest and rather cinematically we were there by 5:58 pm. After a little convincing, we entered the forest. It was already getting dark, and our Innova seemed to be the only vehicle in the forest. We were warned by the officials. ""Don’t get out of the car, don't sound horns and don't project lights etc."" Apparently, elephants might get mad and we could die in the stampede. Where is fun if we don't defy authorities; we stepped out of the car, took more than a few pics.





There were some alarming animal calls as the night progressed, and we followed the sounds, only to find large masses of deer, Bison and baboons. Dusk broke down into deep darkness and chilling breezes; the distant sounds of birds, animals and crickets dominated our engine sound. That was when we saw a loner elephant at the side of the road, which thrilled us (fear might be a better word ;-)) There was no signal in our phone, no sight of man and no light nearby. It was something
Early morning View
Paradise, Heaven, Eden, Nirvana..you name it!
that should be experienced. We reached the finish point of the Nagarhole National park at around 8.30 pm, and like we expected, the gate was locked. We feared we might be stuck there in the forest until the next morning. Fortunately, we found the guard sometime later. Despite of the whining and bribery, he unlocked the gate and we reached Kutta in no time. From there we came to our stay point, Ramcad Guest house. Temperatures dropped to 17'c, and a silhouette of humongous hill loomed over our guest house. It was very dark, and we couldn’t see where we are. We didn’t get a signal here either, except for limited airtel coverage. We settled down and had homemade Non Veg dinner,just outside the cottage in a wooden shelter (like a kiosk) amidst a lavish garden. Coorgh is famous for Pork, and our cook made it deliciously. And after a card game, we rested for the night.

It was only in the morning, we fathomed the real meaning of beauty in the nature. Thick Fog enveloped the guest house, and the greenery was exceedingly beautiful. The huge hill casting its shadow over us might have inspired the CGI in
White Water Rafting.
""Jingalalla Jingalalla..Oooh aah, Oooh aah."". Barpole Theme song!
Disney films. ""You would forget all the troubles, and peace will be at your feet"", is an understatement here. Our guest house is set up amidst a lush garden of flowering plants and huge trees, stationed on a small hill, from which whole of the area was visible. Waking up at 6 in the morning has its own rewards, as we took an early morning walk into the surroundings and it definitely was a Walk To Remember. French toast, Dosas and Idlis comprised our breakfast.









We booked us for Rafting at the nearby Barpole River at 11 Am. The river was 10km from our stay point and located in Tata Tea estates. Once we got there, a Guide ushered us to the rafting point in his jeep, where we geared up for the adventure. Life jackets, Helmets and Oars to steer our raft were given to us, along with rowing commands and safety briefing. We garnered our efforts and strength to row the raft in the white water. (Caution: You will become wet, so gear up accordingly)



Water levels that time were not high, but okay. We rafted
Tata Tea Estates!
You don't like tea? See the pic, and tell me again!
through four frothy white rapids called as- Mickey Mouse, Wicked Witch, Band of bushes and the Big Bang. We loved the wicked witch rapid, for the fall was deeper than others. I don’t know about other packages, but our 'Acepaddlers' rafting gave us a pretty good surprise. The guide stopped us at midpoint in the river, and told us to jump. He didn’t even ask us, he commanded us. We had our life jackets on and so we didn't even blink twice to jump into the water. An Amazing unforgettable swim that was. That Rafting proved worthy of the time and money we spent.











Then we spent some time taking pics at a tea plantation, miles and miles of foliage stretched over the hilly areas, all along the road back to Irupu falls. Irupu falls was heavily crowded, with couples and families massed upon. We hiked up 2km inwards to the falls, and it had a good flow. We decided to bathe (we were already wet from rafting, so no issues there.) in it. The water almost gave us a vagal shock due to its numbing coldness, and still
Irupu falls, level 3 ??
Milky white color, Numbing Cold, Shooting droplets..
we dived into water. One of my friends induced an allergic reaction at the falls (No reason to worry though, it mitigated on its own sometime later.) and so we left the falls and reached the guest house by nightfall.



We could have a bon fire, but we actually forgot the very idea of it. We bought snacks and drinks from the nearby Kutta; we hollowed through the night playing Anthyakshari, Dumb Charades and French Bid under the open shelter, through which cold breeze battled with hot food, giving us a rich experience of a Chilly Night. That was the last night at Ramcad Guest house, so we made a pact to come back to this same place again within 6 years. (This is a bachelor trip, mind you! We don’t know where we would be in the next 6 years.)

The next day we planned to go to Madikeri (70kms from kutta), to pick up another late joining friend. We woke up early at 5, and rode up the hilly areas of Coorgh to reach Madikeri. It was a sight to the sleepy eyes, as fog made us to focus on the road; it was
Enroute to Madikeri @5 AM.
""Fog, as thick as wool""...See, i don't exaggerate!
as thick as wool, but also it was a spectacle to our ‘summer-eyes’ (In Nellore, Fog is a luxury we can’t afford). We picked our friend, booked us a room at VanVihar homestay, just outside Madikeri. We checked in and refreshed, and started off to Mallalli Falls (under the footsteps of Pushapagiri hills), 60km from Madikeri. ‘It was called as newzealand of south’ my friend quoted.













It was 1’o Clock as we reached Mallalli Falls. We didn’t know we had to walk 3km to see the falls (view point), and trek down further 2km from the view point to get wet! The narrow and rugged pathway to the view point allow some vehicles (small cars and jeeps) to travel through; there are also paid jeep services to get you to the view point, but if you want to get wet, you have to climb down the hill.









The view of the falls exceeded our imagination; Kumardhara River gushing through the valley and falling into the 200 feet deep gorge, the sights of which were surrounded by cloud topped
Mallalli falls (Newzealand!!?)
Imagine Seeing this, after a painful 3km walk in the sun. Beauty has a new meaning= Relief!
green hills. Piqued by its beauty, we couldn’t help ourselves but decided to get wet. One has to be cautious in the monsoons about the leeches, poisonous insects and snakes that inhabited the place. The flow of the river nearly threw us off the course while swimming, but we managed to have fun; we thought we deserved it for all the walking we did. It was almost dark, as we walked back to the parking spot. No security was provided there by the government, but it was advised to come back around 6, due to dangers of the forest and drunken men. We were tired, and with another homemade chicken and fish buffet, we ended the night, sleeping early. We earned that right too, coz we didn’t have enough sleep last night and the physical demand was too high for us at Mallalli falls.









Slept early and woke late, got ready and waved bye to the Van Vihar homestay. On the way to Nisargadhama (27km from Madikeri), we shopped at Coorgh spices for tea, coffee and other local made goods. Nisarghadhama, an island formed by Cauvery River, was a park area
Swimmers (who don't know swimming ;-P)
You can see the flow and its rage..Look out for the slippery stones too (especially you /\!)
with lush bamboo groves, deer sanctuary and elephant riding spot. We didn’t spend much time here, and it was crowded too. The hanging rope bridge, tree houses, orchidarium, and boating were some of the other things we saw inside.













From there, we arrived at Tibetan monastery in Bylakuppe, 6kms from Kushalnagar. The golden temple was an astounding architecture, and the first thing we would see on entering. We passed through Tibetan monk settlements and small shrines, which portrayed rich Tibetan culture. Upon entering the ornate golden temple, you will be amazed at the sudden vision of three large golden statues- Buddha at the center and two gurus on either side. There was history painted on the walls of the temple, which would enlighten us about the importance of those magnanimous statues.





Outside, there was also a beautiful garden and many shrines where monks meditate, a Tibetan restaurant (We wanted to eat, but time wasn’t our friend that day) and a flea market. We bought laughing Buddha key chains as souvenirs from the market, but then we learnt that if you give that
Budhha statues.
About 30 feet long..Elegance at its best...It must have cost them a fortune to make them in gold..
keychain to somebody you love, they will live a prosperous and happy life. So we gifted them to ourselves in a circle, so that everyone would get one from the other friend.











We journeyed back to Mysore at 3pm, saw Mysore palace before it was lit. From there, again underestimating traffic, we reached Bangalore at 11pm in the night, and had dinner at Meghana restaurant (Koramangala), one of the best biryanis in the city. The day ended with two of our friends leaving to Tirupathi by bus. On fifth day, the rest of us stayed in Bangalore to see a movie and to eat at Truffles and KFC. By the night, we were in our homes, reminiscing this awesome five day trip; thoughts of which would haunt us forever into the beauty of friendship. I know that I would remember all the jokes, all the counter-jokes and all the silly fights that encountered in this trip. Every moment of it would turn nostalgic as time passes by, and I am grateful for my friends for making me a part of it.





Anyway, I hope
Laughing Buddhha Keychain.
Souvenir! I am not sure how long it stays as a souvenir though.
this blog explains you of everything you need to make this trip. Coorgh is best to travel in monsoons, but in our five day trip, we didn’t have any rain. Researching before planning helps too. You will find every place, every cottage and everything else in Google (duh!) But don’t forget one thing- It’s a trip into the nature, so don’t let your modern life with all your gadgets, interfere with your trip. And hey, Bon Voyage!

March 2008. Sandhya, my batchmate from college paid the Bangalore gang a visit. The plan was to go for a road trip around Bangalore. She really wanted to go to Coorg, but since I was just back from Coorg I insisted we go somewhere else. I did feel bad, later on, about making her change her plans because of me. So the four of us and Rahul (Tipu) decided to head out for Gokarna. But we misplanned the trip and started only late in the evening. We werent able to appreciate the beautiful route to the beach town. But that was made up by the interesting conversations we had on our way.

We passed through curvy steep western ghats with dense forests. It would have been great if the journey had been in daytime. We reached Gokarna early in the morning.

The beach was just optimally crowded. There were several beaches separated by small hills. We could trek over the hills and go from one beach to the other. On the last beach in the row we hired a boat which took us to the beaches not easily accessible. We managed to spot some dolphins too in the ocean.
1206301029
The coast line at Gokarna was uniquely beautiful. We could see big mountains directly merging into the ocean. The beaches were surrounded by mountains on three sides and had ocean on the fourth. We ate and drank at a shack and sometime around 4 headed back for Bangalore.

Once again we ended up traveling in the dark and missed the beautiful part of the journey. It was raining heavily on the way back and our driver was drowsy too. We were happy to be back safe in Bangalore the next morning.

Entering Mysore
Januaray 2007. This was my first trip after moving to Bangalore. Varun and Pawan, my colleagues had just bought their bikes and had been looking to go on a long pleasure ride. So on one fine Friday night we along with Imon decided to set out for Coorg the next morning. We memorized the route to Coorg via Mysore through google maps. Smartphones with 3G connections were not quite there then.

Hitting the highway next morning was quite a good feeling. It was a trip where I was kind of leading the pack of four boys on bikes and thus got a feeling of having finally entered adulthood from the protected years of college life.

We headed south-west of Bangalore on Mysore Road which happened to be one of the best highways at that time. We could easily touch 100+kmph on that road at least upto Mysore. It was a bright and pleasant day. The landscape on both sides of the road comprised endless uniform green fields with stony hills and coconut trees as the only aberrations. The stony hills of Karnataka are quite unique. They are like a spilled stack of large hard rocks, the mud covering them
1202322804
En-route to Madikeri
having been washed off over the ages.

Right before entering Mysore, we took a right turn towards Coorg. On the way to Coorg were Khushalnagar Buddhist monastery, but we kept that for our return trip. Somewhere on our way, I and Varun managed to get far ahead of Pawan and Imon and hence decided to take a detour onto a road which looked like going nowhere. We ended up on a muddy road which lead us to a lake which was completely inconspicuous from the highway because of the bamboo jungle all around it. That place was like a whole different world. No human settlement around. Vast stretch of untouched nature. A lake followed by a hillock and a lot of greenery. For a while we were feeling like Vasco-da-gama.

It was time to get back to the highway after spending few minutes there. Coorg is a hill station and we were expecting steep climb somewhere, but that does not quite come untill the very end. The road does start sloping upwards but hardly becomes steep. It passes through some really unique villages of Karnataka giving a view into a world so contrasting with what we have in
1202322862
Stone art near the lake we discovered
Bangalore. The life is conspicuously slower there making us question the need of daily grind back in Bangalore.

Closer to our destination we get into the region of large trees which looked much different from the ones which we are used to seeing. Or probably they looked unique because we noticed them properly after long. Our road took us through famous Coorg coffee plantations too.

Just before sunset we were at Madikeri, a hill station town in Coorg. Managed to find a cheap room for four of us. Had dinner at this antique looking restaurant named 'the west end' (if I remember right).

We woke up early the next morning to see sun rise at 'Raja seat'. We hired at auto rickshaw driver who became our tour guide as well and took as around some temples and important places of the Madikeri town. Abbey falls was our next stop. That probably was my first time at a waterfall. we went in the water near the falls though was not possible to get directly below the falls.

After breakfast, we hit the road back to Bangalore. On our way back we visited the majestic Harangi Dam which
1202322145
Raja Seat
was a slight detour from the main highway. We took another detour to Khushalnagar Buddhist monastery. The road to monastery had a Tibetan settlement which was quite a surprise for us. It was like a mini Tibet far too south in India. The monastery was a beautiful place. Peaceful, artistically made and tranquil. We got a chance to see a session of prayer from the Buddhist monks.

By the time we reached Mysore, it began to get dark. We still had 150kms to cover to reach Bangalore. We had to slow down because of dark. We took a stop over at a CCD on Mysore highway (70kms from Bangalore). CCD was still a charm back in those days and specially at unique place like that.

We hit Bangalore somewhere around 9:30 and congratulated ourselves on successfully completing a great road trip!

I completed 7 years in Bangalore on August 1, 2014, a fairly long time in one place. That made me start thinking what all I have done in the last seven years. I felt that I could summarize all these years just by all the people I have come across and all the places I have been to in these years. The promotions and hikes in my job dont quite make it to the essence of the last 7 years. So I thought of consolidating all of these memories of the people and the trips with them at one place and there comes this blog.

I had moved to Bangalore in July 2007 right after graduating from college. Many of my friends from college too had moved here at the same time. Among the many were Neelesh, Rahul and Vivek who I would be going on a lot of trips with in the years to come and hence deserve a mention here.

Another one of my friends, Puneet moved to Bangalore in July, 2009. I would get to know Chopra and Meenu through him who would be part of many of my trips in 2009-10. Puneet moved from Bangalore to Bombay in December 2010 almost marking an end of an era full of travel within these 7 years.

My Techfest gang (including their WAGs) too deserves a mention here as I would at least one trip a year with it.

After May 2012, I would be joined by Sonam in most of my travels.

I hope to continue updating this blog with all my past of future travel descriptions chronologically.

Turkey
Likes to hang out outside the studio and serenade us with gobbles.
Currently I am sitting at the airport waiting for a flight to Goa... I got here extremely early so I thought it was time for an update.

There hasn't been much adventuring for me over the past few weeks so I thought I might make a list of things I have learned that may be of use to someone wanting to travel to Bangalore. Please understand I must only say Bangalore because people from other places tell me they are totally different to here and different things apply but I guess some general things will be consistent.

So must begin by saying that one month is as long as it takes to feel adjusted. I have found myself a routine and some coping mechanisms for spending a lot of time on my own - a healthy addiction to Sons of Anarchy and Paulo Coelho novels. I feel more confident being out in my own area in the evenings now, I know the streets and some shops where I have become a regular customer give me a sense of safety. Two of my students have been educating me about the local food and introduced to some people who work at
Dosa
Onion Rava Masala Dosa, Plus various chutneys and Subzi
the local restaurants, which was a huge help.

Food in south India consists mainly of rice. You can get it in various forms - standard steamed rice, dosa, a flat, semi fried pancake, iddly, a round steamed rice cake and vada, a fried doughnut, all of which come in various forms and accompany what is called Subzi or vegetable curry, chutney, usually coconut, sometimes Mint, mango or tomato, Sambar, a spicy lentil based stew, very thin and Rasam, a soup like concoction. You can get all of these things at most places, each place having their own version. Then there is Biriyani, which consists of rice, chicken or mutton meat or vegetables. There are different types of Biriyani, depending on the spices used. So far I have tryed Donne Biriyani, served in a bowl made out of dried Banana leaf which comes with chicken, half a boiled egg, chopped onion, cucumber and gravy and Ambur Biriyani, differnt spices are used but again served with chicken and gravy - there was salad at the table in the food house but I was not game enough to try it, as caution must be taken when eating fresh vegetables in restaurants that
Breakfast
Iddly, Vada and various other delights
are not connected to 5 star hotels. Then there are the breads, Chapati, a particular kind of wheat based flat bread and Parotta, a layered wheat flat bread. I crave Parottas, parotta and subzi, parotta and chicken, parotta and mutton, it's become my staple, a fine and filling alternative to rice I think everyone should try. Chapattis are simple and delicious but the Parotta... I have tried lots of different chicken curries, names of which I can never remember, I'd need to have a note book with me constantly to record them, but this would be to hard with my fingers covered in food as I become more accustomed to eating everything by hand without cutlery. The amount of times I miss hear what is being said for the accent is nearly 100% and vice versa, so it can hard to order in places with no menu, but try your best, keep repeating yourself and they'll bring you something yummy usually so not to worry. Chicken is the most common and healthiest meat to get (or so I'm told) in Bangalore, so there has been many chicken meals, but I finally found a place I can get fresh/frozen meats from
Mule and Carriage
Common on the streets in Wilson Garden - My suburb
(Nature's basket, expensive supermarket for local standards but a must for western comfort food) so I finally made a delicious pork and fennel pasta topped with Granda Padano and plan to cook goat soon, this meal finally made me feel settled.

It's Ramzan (or Ramadan) right now, and a very old friend of mine who owns a hotel in Bangalore, took me, along with his gorgeous wife and brother-in-law, to a suburb called Frazier Town to try the special street food stalls, only available during Ramzan. It was so delicious and the stalls stretched for miles with most major hotels and food places bringing out their finest halal street food. Chicken on a stick, beef kebab, Biriyani and I tried Haleem, a beef/wheat dish which I can best describe as a mashed up beef pie, but that makes it sound bad when it's actually delicious. It's becoming fun to try food now the stomach has adjusted, but a note of caution must be made, only eat at recommended places or 5 star hotels, even locals get food poisoning. It's a shame really that the hygiene is not better, but with so many people, I imagine it must be hard
8th Cross road and it's various non human inhabitants
Sad truth to the life of the cow in the city - For some reason they love hanging out in Wilson Garden
to police this with health inspectors.

I have been so amazed that 2 of my students are in full fast for Ramzan and continue to take class almost as normal - sometimes they simply must sleep, but thats some seriously committed faith to be able to endure such a rigorous schedule and not even take a sip of water, mind blowing! Spirituality and faith are so very strong here, traditions have really been upheld and I find that acceptance of history and culture very inspiring.

Getting around is becoming easier. When I first got here I could never imagine how anyone could navigate themselves, the road system is very confusing, but I am pleased to say I can find my way to some places without the help of google maps and know if someone is taking me for a ride when I get in the rickshaw. Something all people must know is the rickshaw and taxi guys see foreigners as an easy pass to getting free stuff. I was casually walking down Brigade road, a main branded shopping street in Bangalore when a cabbie approached me, explaining that if I went with him to some places he would
Welcome to Attakkalari Centre for Movement Arts
get a free t-shirt for his children, I went along because he had been honest. I upset him as I failed to stay in the stores for longer than 5 minutes because I was like, seriously, I will never buy a sari, where will I wear one? And, no I can not buy wooden artefacts that will be taken off me by customs, so this is a waste of time. All of the emporiums stock the same goods and if your good at bargaining, you will not be charged a fortune, but the store clerks and Rickshaw men expect you to have no idea, so don't be alarmed, play their game, I did and got to see around an area of Bangalore and quality handcrafts for free. Also never go in a rickshaw without the metre, they will try and double your fare and if they don't want to go to the area you want on your terms they can be very rude, just ignore them and find someone who will - a thick skin is required.

The best treat I got in the last two weeks, apart from a full Sunday of cleansing rain, was a double dose of full body Ayurvedic massage and steam boxing. I suggest you get someone to recommend you a place, because there are good massage places and ones that give you a pretend treatment for the money because you are a foreigner. There are many different types of Ayurvedic treatments, that treat all ranges of body and mind issues. I went in specifically to unwind my muscles from work and to de-stress so I can sleep better. Women massage women and men massage men, and ladies if you are not comfortable with someone you don't know touching your breasts I do not recommend this. I was happy that when they say full body they meant it! You have to wear this paper g-string and lay on a wooden table that has a slight upward curve in it. You get covered in medicated oil and I mean coated, completely, my body was sliding on the table at some points due to the amount of oil used. They're movements are rhythmic, repeated and increase in pressure. On first treatment expect them to take it easy on you, this is a precaution due to foreign bodies not being used to the herbs and oils used, but you can tell them to be firmer. After the massage I was placed in a steam box. This was pretty funny because it is not a sauna room, it is literally a box with a hole in it to keep your head out. I was happy about this because I hate saunas because I get to hot and light headed. The masseuse said the head must remain out of the heat to avoid the giddiness. After the massage you are recommended to rest, I got the best sleep I've had the entire time I've been in India that night and after the second massage, it was like all of my sadness and stress had been wiped away. I think that from now on when I travel, no matter where I am I will get a massage in the first week, just to release the tension and anxiety that can be associated with travelling.

Lastly I will mention a bit about how the dancing has been going. I have started teaching the Company as well as the training course, so all of my time on the weekdays is taken up with sharing my knowledge with these wonderful people. I had a really magical moment this past week, when I realised how beautiful it was to watch someone embodying my movement and how powerful this is to witness. I do not claim originality to any class exercise I create, It follows the structures and conventions I have learnt, but is my interpretation of them manifesting into sequences of movements. The feedback gained from watching different bodies grapple with my material helps me see my habits and the places I skip because they are difficult for me, forcing me to change my approach and expand my practice. I have also been surprised every day with how much I have retained and learnt, with the added challenge of answering questions of what the exercises are for, why the class is structured in such a way and so forth. I have started creating a piece for the Diploma students graduation, that was described to me as a jigsaw puzzle, with unexpected relationships and serious of random, although somehow related events. Everyone getting a moment to shine and with 26 students, I feel this is very important. I get woken up at night with steps, counts, ideas flooding my consciousness, I love it. This experience has really allowed me the time I've needed to explore myself as a teacher and an artist, plus learning a bit about business along the way.



So to sum up:

1. Only eat at recommended places or 5 star hotels.

2. Be ready to bargain. Start by buying things at government approved stores until you get used to the prices, this includes local supermarkets for your fresh fruits and veg.

3. Never travel in a cab or rickshaw without the metre.

4. Be patient, you will adjust.

5. Get a massage and find ways to relax.

6. Dance with others, share and create.

Buffalo/Cow feeding House
So let me start today by mentioning that as I left the house I saw 3 beautifully dressed transexuals walking down my street, they gave me the warmest greeting I've had so far out on the road, otherwise people just stare and like in every city, very few smile. To add to my already camp morning I then see the police men riding around on their Leopard print motorbikes, I remember a girl posting something explaining that they are Government regulation for a section of the police force called 'The Cheetahs,' Vey amusing! I wanted to keep these posts quite frequent but I came down with fever (yes I'm doing real well on the health front, I've heard it's not uncommon for foreigners to take at least one month to get adjusted so almost there!) so I couldn't concentrate on anything in the last few days, but I must say to all the dance teachers out there who come in and teach when they are sick, you guys are the toughest of all. I now know how hard it is now and I have the upmost respect, it's about 100% harder than actually taking the class when your sick because of
The man with Coconut stick
I forgot to mention the loongies.... Male skirts, very stylish, extreme comfort worn throughout the places I visited.
the energy you must give to your students, constantly assessing their needs for that day and demonstrating exercises fifty million times. But enough about that.

Last week teaching was so, so much fun, I started introducing Improvisation tools to the students to get some idea of what kind of piece I'm going to create with 28 of them on a teeny tiny stage (yes, no relying on amazing spacial patterns, there's no room for that). I felt that students really opened up and we got to have a few great laughs. They stepped outside of their comfort zones and inspired me, they do that everyday anyway but more so in the last week of improvising. I became a total dance nerd during the week, just going home and cooking for myself, really getting in to a groove, researching bits and bobs, structuring ideas for my work, so by the end of the week I was looking forward to an adventure.

Friday evening at some of the girls took me to a pretty cool cafe near work, I would never have found it if they didn't show me as you wouldn't notice such a nice placed tucked down a
Getting Coconts
short ally, away from this chaotic, dirty main road but it was there. (Oh by the way monsoon has started and just now as I am typing my power went out for the second time this week in the evening, power shortages happen here quite a bit.) The waiter spilled some coffee, 2 girls got drenched, they were happy it didn't happen to me or they would have felt bad it seems, I felt bad for the girls but accidents happen, especially with those stupid glass trays, always despised using them! Next on the agenda was a scooter ride and I know I said last week how scared I was, this time around I actually didn't mind, to the point where I wished I could drive it. Safer if that does not happen though I'm sure as I still struggle walking across the road sometimes. I was navigator, that was fine, we reached our destination early (in India this is a big thing) and sat to watch a rather unfortunate dance show, details of which I will spare you, I'll just say it was the equivalent to a bad midday movie. Then on to more scooter time and a lovely
Opening the Coconut
dinner at one of my student's mum's restaurant, chinese/thai food.... Delicious! Then back home for a chat that lasted until around 4pm! Oh my concept of time was going to get a workout this weekend that's for sure, usually it takes more than 2 beers to keep me up that late but hey there's a first time for everything. Yay, Power's back my eyes were hurting!

So my friends have planned for me a trip to me to a village, the home town of the lady (I prefer not to use peoples names out of respect) so I can see the farmlands and some beautifully hidden/non tourist regions. Our trip was delayed due to only getting to sleep at 4pm the previous morning, it was further delayed due to a small traffic incident, I was not in the car but breakfast was going to be. Breakfast of Idli wala and some chutneys, so yummy. We finally hit the road around 2pm and it takes us 2hrs to get out of Bangalore traffic, on to the highway. Stopping at toll booth, men are trying to sell stuff, coming up to inspect me one by one, very intimidating but it's ok
View on the way to Jain Temple
the window was shut and doors locked. We reach our first destination, a boys orphanage where a guru of 110 years lives and oversees the care of these orphans, feeding up to 10,000 people per day, incredible place, there was an energy there I can't quite describe. We went up to see the temple and a young boy said a prayer for me, giving me some powder that is said to be auspicious and I should keep for as long as possible, unfortunately I may be meeting customs on that but that's yet to be seen. I got so see the guru to, a very tall man dressed in orange, sitting giving people blessings. My friend told me that he over heard some of the boys saying comments that they were proud that a white woman came to see their place, how lovely! From here we continue to the ladies town, Tiptur, it rained a bit on the way, so soothing and refreshing in the heat. I check in to a hotel, a more comfortable sleeping/shower option and then we head to her parents place to meet them. Such genuine and happy people greet me and feed me the traditional
Largest single stone statue
sweet pancake with fruit salad then rice and sambal. Yum. Then off to meet the cousins, so many people were there, many with no understanding of english except for the work bye. They were so keen to talk to me they would just address me directly like I understood and me to them, obviously there was a translation happening through my friend but still it was nice to be addressed directly. So yep another late night.

7am In the morning I'm back to her parents for traditional breakfast (will have to get back to you with the name) and coffee. Then we set off on our adventure, first travelling a mere 20 min to the village were her aunties and uncles farm Coconut, Tiptur is famous for coconut and boy were they delicious, I got to drink 2 fresh ones from the tree, eat 2 fresh mangoes and some jackfruit, I'd never had jackfruit, it's so sweet tastes like a lolly! The family were so proud to be getting me all these fresh treats, it was super special for me. The air was so fresh, the farm so peaceful. Again different family member were talking to me like I
Intricate details in Belur
knew what they were saying, such a happy bunch, joking with each other. I was hoping to see a peacock but 2 puppies and plenty of Buffalo was what I got and I was happy with that. Then we drove on to a Jain Temple in Shravanabelagola, home to the biggest single stone statue (a naked man, I could go in to more history but that would take forever). You have to climb around 500 stairs barefoot to see it and there are some very old preserved carvings in the rock. The view was spectacular, surrounded by coconut farms and bodies of water. Many women asked to have their picture taken with me, I found this very amusing and felt like some weird celebrity! It was a beautiful sunny day also so this was a wonderful experience especially the stones burning the underside of my feet making me literally want to run up and down the hill. We then continued to Hassan for lunch and afterwards drove to Belur to see another temple with ancient stone carvings, oh my was this stunning! Such intricate details of hand carved stone dating back to the 1700's. All of the gods, Bharatnatym positions,
Snake Charriot
animals and Karma sutra positions carved around the outside of a gorgeous temple, I had no energy for a tour but was happy observing the workmanship, so delicate and precise, no 2 pieces the same, such craftsmanship you will probably never see in this day. A must see! After a quick stop outside Belur at a water catchment to get some fresh air, we then journeyed to Halebidu to see another temple crafted in the same way. This temple seemed to have preserved better and the grounds were really well maintained with greenery and a garden surrounding it. The temple in Belur was stone as far as the eye could see, so I enjoyed the feel of Halebidu more. They had some rather big statues of the cow god and plenty of carvings of other gods, the mind boggles with all the stories that were encapsulated around these buildings, represented by these figures of worship.

Then on to the road and my what a road this was. There were so many holes, so many different surfaces, for kilometres and kilometres, it felt like we were driving to the end of the world! So many lorry vans and truck
Halebidu
rolled by with so many people packed on to them, it was so strange to see! I'm told the roads are being fixed in India now, under the new government and my god they would want to be, I thought we would never be able to get over some of the terrain but we merrily bumped our way along, cracking jokes about it because there was no way around this road. They had freshly made one part and used big rocks to block people from riding over it instead of those orange bollard things, very environmentally friendly. Some parts had the bitumen spread at different levels so there were some bizarre speed bumps. It was truly an experience like no other, especially seeing the amount of people travelling on the road. We were joking that they were fitting entire villages into rickshaws, only in India! When we finally got off that road and on to the good highway I felt sad a little, the rough road was way more fun, albeit slow. When we finally arrived back in Tiptur, it was the cousins turn to feed me. I tried a bit of a ragi ball, this weird purplish flour thing
Grounds at Halebidu
you are not meant to chew, took 2 mouthfuls and thought I may choke, I am really not used to eating semi solid food without chewing, no one was offended, quite contrary, impressed I had a taste. So I happily ate the best Chippatis I have had with some Mutton curry and fried chicken, so tasty, I was really spoiled this weekend, but by the time I got to finish my dinner it was close to 11pm and since I was running on very little sleep I was super duper tired, it was worth it! The head lady of the house did her traditional ceremony placing a bindi on my forehead and saying a prayer for me, giving me 2 Bananas, some leaf and Betal nuts. This ceremony only happens for the women, I felt privileged or and I got to have a picture with the baby.

I learnt something very valuable this weekend; It does not matter what culture you are from or what type of upbringing you have had, if you remove all preconceived ideas about what a person will be like due to the others of their culture/religion/country you have met you will see the true person, the soul and on a very uniquely primitive, human level you will connect, regardless of language barriers. People can really surprise you if you let them. Also, listening is the key to learning about a person, and willingness to let go a bit of yourself will allow you to experience them and what they believe, this is very important to building an understanding of each other.

So now back to Bangalore, the Rain and dancing. Oh and my fever/cold only lasted 2 days. It is advisable to get a good rest each night so you don't wear yourself out and become susceptible to foreign bugs. Now I really am finding my feet and loving the experience of this crazy place.

Published: June 23rd 2014


This was to be one of the hardest weeks of my life - I just didn't know it yet! It is not until I leave the airport that the gravity of my decision hits me, It's 1am Sunday Morning, my escort leads me straight on to the road where we are walking amongst the taxi traffic, which is hectic by the way, there is absolutely no system on the roads here, people just do whatever they want, horns honking. After finally getting ushered to the cab rank and getting in the cab we are off in to the extremeness of the traffic. It truly has to be seen for one to even grasp how crazy it is on the road (there is 'no traffic' right now either because it's so early, oh my!), I thought I was not going to make it or that we would crash for sure, but some how in all the chaos the people seem to manage, like it's second nature. After one hour we reach our destination, A wonderfully big apartment I get to have to myself for the next two months a blessing after a long stint on couches, sublets and my old room at my folks place, compliments of Attakallari Centre for Movements Arts where I am due to start work monday and what a day monday was, but I'll get to that shortly. I'm left with not much information except for a dinosaur nokia mobile with no internet, great! I go to have a shower to find there is no hot water, well I know there is now because a friend showed me how the systems work here, but I have no idea, so I'll been having cold showers for an entire week, this is ok in fact because it is so warm and lovely a big jump from the bitterness of the Australian winter. After coming to terms with this I sleep.

I have a good friend in Bangalore who picked me up after I awoke and took me on a tour of the city. I'm thinking this was wonderful, I'm feeling like I can cope with this forgetting that I am cushioned from the real environment of the city in his luxury car and his knowledge of were to go (he took me to a palace for lunch, very lovely grounds so lush and green!). I only came to realise how intense the city was the next day (monday) early morning as I was trawling the streets with no idea in hell where I am going. I was given vague directions from my land lady, who I had to ask what the address for my house was because no one told me that either, asking many many people as they went by to point me in the right direction going around and around in circles for an hour looking for a place I'm told should have taken less than ten minutes. The stink of garbage and god knows what else made this experience even more difficult, getting stared at, honked at as I need to take the road because the foot path is non existent, laughed at, disregarded.... Why no one showed me or came to pick me up I have no clue, but by the time a rickshaw driver with decent english finally pointed me to the right road, only to be greeted by a security man I had no hope in hell understanding or explaining that I was there to work, my nerves were so frazzled and I could not keep the tears back. I'm sitting outside the place now being stared down by the cleaning ladies, the security man telling me for half an hour about how it costs one lac to buy a suzuki and me sitting there thinking what in the world possessed me to do this! the lady I have been speaking to arrives and I finally get to talk sense with someone. I get taken inside after the yoga class and am introduced to the majority of my 28 students, I am calming down now! I get to watch their next class, Kalarippayattu, Indian Martial Art. A highly physical discipline consisting of different series of deep squats and kicking. know I am going to learn a lot from observing the traditional movement disciplines but am so hungry so I do not stay to watch Bharatnataym (classical indian dance). On my way how I got head butted by a cow, apparently I stepped to close to his head, but I had no choice, he was on the footpath! I am going home to eat because I am very weary of the local restaurants, they look unhygenic and I would have no clue what to order anyway, on the way I ask the internet shop man about getting a dongle, and he just shakes his head and hand at me and continually says no. Far out nothing is going my way today! I get back and now it's time to take the role for my ballet class, oh what a joke that was, Half of the names I have no idea about, I make a joke of this but I'm feeling rather vulnerable here! So thats over we get on with the class, I am testing their skill level today for both ballet and contemporary and can see gaps in their knowledge immediately, this gives me my confidence back. The universal language of the body and what it needs. There are a few knee and shoulder issues, I think this is great not for the students obviously but now I know where to direct my training and what the students need for strength. Dance really can lift your spirits and give you freedom even when your nerves are completely shot out, bringing a joy and forgetting about the crazy desire in my heart to run back to Australia. The day has ended now time to find food, but first I am given the Wifi code and an internet dongle now, sweet relief I can tell my loved ones I have not died in the flight! I go the the place recommended and once again I have no idea what to order and surprise surprise the workers don't speak english! So much for being told that Bangalore is a big city you will be fine many people speak english, well today they didn't. I get something finally, the people there are nice enough. Going home was a tad frightening, I don't think I'm in a very safe area for a woman to walk alone at night, yet another amazing bonus for the day! I get home and take a cold shower and hand wash my clothes (something I will be doing a lot from now on). Finally taking solace in the adult cartoon Archer, red wine and sleep.

Jetlag wakes me at 4am the next morning, silence, oh sweet silence where have you been? I'm grateful for being up so early, by 5am a beautiful singing can be heard, I find out later that it is from the church down the road calling people to pray. I find this very soothing. My friend picks me up and takes me for a walk in the park and breakfast, iggly and Masala dosa, delicious. The home to prepare a ballet lesson, before heading in to watch the Bharatnataym class. How expressive and beautiful this dance is, powerful in rhythmic grounding and light in characterisation of the face with fluidity of the upper body and clarity of mudras of the hands. very powerful! After break they come back, we dance together, the students seem to really enjoy my lessons, they later tell me that they love my classes and are having fun, that they always found ballet boring but not with me... The imagery I have been focusing on must work, very good research for my studies into ideokinesis and obsession with ways to make the physicality easy even when the movement is tough, correcting alignment with image and anatomical facts. They clap for me when I do even the simplest of steps, I feel so fabulous, it's a real pleasure to be admired and to feel that through a friendly less demanding nature I can see great improvement and deepen the awareness of their bodies with them. This really is a shared learning experience. I can see a very very distinct difference in culture by the way the students respect me and respond to me. They have very little care for being self conscious and self esteem seems high, they are friendly and supportive to each other, none seem to have a competitive bone in their body. One thing I find so hilarious is the customary head movement for ok, I ask if it is understood and due to this sideways head wobble I have no idea if they mean yes or no. The rest of the week continues like this. Going to and from the studio not going to far from home, I am brave enough one evening, desperate for some meat to eat that I take the rickshaw to the main road. Holy moly, rickshaws are hilarious, a bit frightening at first but funny none the less, I'm glad I've been told how much I should pay though because I can see myself being ripped off very easily. I also take one trip on the back of a students scooter to see a very dismal dance show in a pub, this was scary, I told him he was brave for riding a scooter there as I clung to him fearing for my life! I am getting very tired of being stared at by the end of the week, I feel sensitive and am going in and out of homesickness, loneliness, absolute blinding moments of inspiration and joy, very surreal almost. I see the dirt and rubbish in the street, wild dogs, cows , monkeys turkeys and can not understand how are why people must live this way, how is this chaos possible? It is so far beyond my grasp!

I met a lovely man in the plane on the way over, who would by the end of the week end up being like my family. He told me not to fight India and I would have a good time, but by friday I feel desperate to escape, my stomach has started aching, I have not been eating well as I still have no clue what to eat. He invites me over friday evening after I finish work. Friday was hard for me, the students support and love really picked me up and we did a slow massage/stretch class as they were tired and to be honest I had little energy. I stayed back late having philosophical convocations with some students, still after they leave I feel lonely and I am grateful for the invitation to stay the night with a friend. His company driver picks me up. Nice guy we had a lovely chat and he took me down what I can only describe as the most dangerous road I have ever been down. I arrive at his door and his wife greets me with a tray with contains a sweet smelling candle, and powder, she dots my head with the powder and feeds me an almond. This is truly one of the most special experiences I have ever had, I want to cry with joy and relief. Her neighbour and daughter come by, they are so excited to meet me and we stay up the entire night talking laughing and I feel like I have found long lost relatives. The next day I am thankful to be there, my stomach has given up, it's time for the inevitable travel bug to hit me, full blown gastro, my stomach feels like it is going to come violently out of my mouth. I sleep for more than fifteen hours, cry and want to seriously run home. They care for me like I have never experienced, with pure unconditional love. I am so thankful, the universe really helped me when it sat me next to this man on the plane. After this, the next day I feel better. I have been dreaming vividly and feel an undeniable guilt for wanting to leave my students, I can not leave them, I must endure, I will feel better. They take me out and make sure I am stocked up with good quality food, both are from farming regions so we speak the same language when it comes to quality produce. I'm feeling better now, all I needed was a little help and a little love. So here ends my first week in India, I can say that I have indeed been shocked and the advice I have for the solo traveller is find a friend, you need them! Also no expectation is best.

Bryn knew early on that some his undercover work was going to require him to blend in with the locals.
Hello you beautiful people.

Firstly I am so sorry that it has been so long since my last blog post, I appreciate that you have not all been sat round, wringing your hands, deep in worry for me, but I still need to say sorry.

Ok, so when I left off last time I was heading to Bangalore to meet with my old friend Bryn to work on his thesis for his masters degree in Primatology. I wasn’t quite sure what to expect but I knew Bryn, so I knew it wouldn’t be dull….

Now then, the truth is I can’t get in too many details about the process for reasons I will explain later but I can tell you about what this has morphed in to and the findings.

What started out as looking at the ritual torture of wildlife has turned in to a weird study in to Black Magic.

So let me explain. Bryn always had some evidence that his chosen primate, the Slender Loris, was being used in Black Magic but this has developed in to a study about the use of both illegal ,and legal, wildlife in Black Magic sacrifices.
IMG_2222
Not a terrible office....

Oooooh and what a strange world it is. It ranges from the relatively harmless things such as marrying two frogs to bring the rains, to blowing up a flap shelled turtle to release the treasure inside. I have so many example of these beliefs it goes on and on….

If you keep a Red Sand Boa snake under your safe it will protect your fortune. The idea is that the Red Sand Boa appears to have two heads, so it can see in both directions and will see folk coming to grab your fortune.

Therefore traders will split the tail of the snake and pin fake eyes in the tail so it appears that the snake has two heads.

And then it gets stranger……….the heavier the snake the better protection it brings. So traders started to force-feed the snake ball bearings to increase the weight.

Buyers started to work this scam out so they started to feel for the ball bearings in the gut of the snake.

Traders got wise to this…..so now they force-feed the snake liquid mercury so that buyers cannot detect the artificial weight increase. It doesn’t really matter that the snake
IMG_2226
Would you pick him out in a crowd?
will die within a few hours, once the money has exchanged hands it is too late.

And more……

Legend has it if you see a Jackal when you wake up it gives you good luck. So some folk will keep Jackal captive at home and when they wake up they will head straight to the cage (without seen anyone else) so the first thing they see in morning is the Jackal.

During the recent elections a pot containing the head of a Jackal was found outside the parliament building. This suggests (as do our interviews) that this sort of stuff is far more prevalent then you would have thought. It certainly is not just restricted to “uneducated” rural areas.

No, these beliefs permeate the political and legal classes.

Now I would love for you to think of me as some sort of Indiana Jones type, but the truth is most my work as a research assistant is pretty dull, typing up notes and referencing documents, in a clean and safe apartment in Bangalore.

It really is not that exciting. And for good reason. The truth is that if two white faces turn up to
IMG_2228
We found a second hand bookshop in Bangalore, it was like a journey through my childhood.
interview a poacher or a practitioner their suspicion will double. These guys already realise they are on the wrong side of the law and are only talking because of the promise of money, we can’t spook them even more.

There is a serious aim to all this study. Every time a Jaca is captured or a Flap Shelled Turtle is blown up, there is one less. When there are no more Hyenas or Flap Shelled Turtles left poachers and practitioners will start to use other similar species until they are decimated too. This study could be used to try and convince religious and spiritual leaders to turn their back on these practices. This will not be easy though, there is a huge amount of money involved in this trade. Others have tried and failed. But it could help.

Anyhoo.

I am going to support Bryn in this venture until around the 25th of June and then I am going to take off for a while. Still not sure exactly what I am going to do. I am going to stay in India until the 26th of July (when my Visa expires). I am thinking about heading over
IMG_2230
The farm we were staying at had four lovely dogs. It was nice to have canine company again. One day I decided to give them a wash. One was a St Bernard. It took over an hour.
to Thailand for a holiday.

Everything is easy in Thailand……….unlike India….which is a struggle… Our favorite phrase at the moment is “wither the challenge”. You set off to achieve something on a day but within an hour you feel withered.

So, all my biggest love to you for reading this, I appreciate it more than you will ever know.

Loves

John Jo.

PS Sorry for the miserly amount of pictures.

We set out for Hampi with a lot of expectations as we had heard so much about it and seen such wonderful pictures. The sheer vastness, complexity and craftsmanship of the place left us awestruck and we were left wondering as to how something like this was built and sustained so many centuries ago. The pictures have been taken at various locations like Vittala, Virupaksha and Krishna temple complexes....and we were not in the least bit disappointed.

Goa, Hampi and on to Bangalore


3rd Class sleeper class train to Hampi
We were warned about children being above us on bunks and having little 'accidents' on us which had us on full alert!
We last minute decided to go to Hampi, we weren't going to bother as its a pain to get to but we re routed ourselves and could get from Hampi to Bangalore and from here we could continue south to Kerala, we also looked at lots of pictures on the internet and decided we had to go if we were near it.

Hampi itself is a small village built as close as possible to the sights and literally there to cater for the tourists, all the locals live up the road In Hospet near the train station. Hampu itself is a UNESCO heritage site as the ruins within it are from the Vijayanagara Empire. The historical sights can be dated back to 1343 - so VERY old. There are many Hindu temples, military buildings (including an elephant garage!) and civil building to explore. We had given ourselves a couple of days to have a look around the place and some of the main sights.

We travelled by train from Goa to Hampi in Air Con (AC) 3 tier which was more than Ok, this means bunks of three beds with the bottom bunk being used to sit on during
Hampi
the day and at night they all fold down for beds. This is the last tier of ac compartments, the next step down is non ac and non booking of seats so a free for all and we werent quite ready to try that with all our bags. There with lots and lots of locals around us which was great, this tier of the train was very busy with people and luggage who have a little bit more money to upgrade to this class. One family kept coming down the train with boxes and suitcases and room was running very low, we put a couple of suitcases under my bed and they were all around us, then the family came down and there was around 15 of them all having different berths around the train but wanting to sit together which after some doing what they wanted to do and not backing down they won with other people changing seats to accomodate them. After around 30 minutes they started eating, they had brought the biggest spread lve ever seen, shopping bag full if cooked rice, chappatis galore and lots of curry and finally cakes and cakes and cakes. We decided
Hampi
they must have come from a wedding and brought all the left overs. It did look delicious, and the mum fed all the men first and waited for them to finish before sorting her own food out. What dedication. We kept looking over hoping for a plate full but to no avail, we made do with the train food of a fried vegetable cutlet in bread and a masala tea. The train was so busy with people walking up and down and the tea and food sellers moving up and down the train. With this and the scenery ever changing from the green lush lands of south Goa turning into more baron landscape of the Karnataka area it was a good journey. The train took around 10 hours so we were in by dinner time to Hampi.

We got probably a very overpriced tuk tuk to Hampi and looked around for somewhere to stay. Coming into Hampi felt like being transported to another world and reminded me so much of The Flintstones and Bedrock. India's landscape is so diverse l would never of though the terrain in Hampi would be possible! It was very dry with HUGE boulders thrown
Roaming around the beautiful sights
Hampi
around, like marbles giants would play with. Then amongst these boulders were the number one attractions of the temples. We bargained down a decent room which had a roof terrace so we could watch the sunset over one of the main temples which was pretty much on our door step. Having had a delicuous nut curry we found a tuk tuk driver to take us around the sights the next day (the area is vast and walking is out of the question to do it all in a day or two), we agreed a pick up time and hit the hay getting an earlyish night ready for the next day.

Our guy rocked up 30 minutes late which meant we were worried he wasnt coming and we were panicking about what to do as we were aiming to leave the next day meaning we would miss out on seeing the temples we wanted to as we would have to find another driver. Whoops all round when he arrived and we started the day. We saw tons of temples and after a few they started to merge into one, same same but different. It was also BOILING!..we ate lots of
Unless you have an elephant garage you havent made it
Hampi
ice creams which lasted about 10 seconds before melting due to the heat, and drank lots of water, near the end we were just chilling in the tuk tuk with the driver as we were too hot and tired to move. Our driver was lovely and everything went well until he started telling us about his life and the guilt trip kicked in. He told us about how he was practically an orphan after his entire family had died from various illness's. We listened intently and was reminded of how different peoples lives can be, as well as thinking and hoping that his story was true and not a scam for more money out of us.

On the plus side he did help us out getting a package posted home so things werent too bad. Some word of warning - posting packages back to the Uk is a huge pain!...you have to find a box, take it to a tailors and have it sewn up, then take it to a post office to be sent away. As with India, a simple thing takes forever and is never as easy as you think and the time yo think it will
Craigs fan club continues..
Hampi
take will actually take 5x along. Our guy helped us with all of this and we probably paid more for the sewing up part than a local but still only cost a few quid.

One attraction l enjoyed was the elephant garage! it was huge, you know you've made it when you need a garage to keep your elephants in. Another highlight was meeting and talking to a guy selling sugar cane water. He even let Craig make our juice which was fun and surprisingly hard work.

Our last stop of the day was to climb a rather high hill to watch the sunset. This did not go to plan, we followed what we thought was the path- there were arrows but we still managed to take the wrong arrow ending up in someones back garden!..we thought we were back on track but got scared as l read about mountain bears roaming around and also we saw a LOT of HUGE monkeys (rabies alert) up where we wanted to be..we were also the only tourists heading up there which l wasnt loving. so we made it half way, decided we could get a good view of sunset from
Freshly fresh lemonade to cool us down
Hampi
there and thats where we sat.

The next day we attempted to leave Hampi...we had tried to book train tickets to Bangalore and were on the waiting list - we started at 10 and moved down to 2 during the course of the day we were meant to leave, with a couple of hours to go before the train left we were at 1, so we crossed our fingers and after a bit of a mad dash through the roads of Hampi fearing for the tuk tuk to roll over after a couple of hair raising bends we made it to the train station. We checked with the booking office and we weren't on the train - Plan B was to go in unreserved class. We had done this once but it was empty and was during the day, we decided if we got on (after the stampeed of people) we would have to take it in shifts to sleep and not take any food or drink offered to us as it would most likely have some sort of sleeping drug in it so we would fall asleep and wake up very robbed. If we were lucky we may

be able to buy our way onto the AC tiered sleeper. The train arrived and after looking through the windows of the un-reserveed class and lack of seating and any space, followed by the hundred people trying to get on we abandoned Plan B and had a pep talk/team meeting on the platform to form Plan C.

Plan C - As we left the train station still with no idea what to do, a tuk tuk driver started to talk to us as we thought we had first arrived and needed a lift to Hampi. After explaining our situation the very well spoken Tuk tuk driver suggested we get a sleeper bus to Bangalore from here we could catch a bus down to Kerala, so we headed to Hospet for a look and see if this was possible. Hospet as l said was more where the locals live and was all hustle and bustle, real Indian restaurants, homeless people and really more like India than Hampi. The bus for that night was full but our guy sorted us on the next nights one and was so kind and helpful to us. Next plan was to find somewhere to stay,
Sunset on the lookout for bears
Hampi
Instead of heading back to Hampi we deceied to stay in Hospet and take in the authenticity of it all and thought the money we would save on going back and fourth to Hampi and difference in food cost would get us into the ONLY hotel in Hospet. This was the BEST decision we had made and our second EMERGENCY hotel for a night situation since arriving in India (in the whole trip so far we have only needed one other emergency night in a hotel and that was in Bolivia, but i think twice in India isn't too bad..i mean this is India where things can go wrong and not to plan all the time). The hotel was clean, the room cold, the shower hot, a computer where we could print things off and there was a television with english channels!..The staff werent as good and the tuk tuk driver was x10 nicer with much better english language but it was great and we relished it for the night!.. This hotel was a 24 hour hotel which worked very well for us, so the time you check in the time you leave 24 hours exactly. After a lovely sleep
Super comfortable double bed for sleep and cuddles en route to Bangalore
and nice breakfast we chilled in our room then headed our to see what Hospet had to offer. One great thing was eating in a real indian restaurant with prices to match. We ate a delicious Thali meal which cost around £1 and was very filling. We stayed in our room and watched some english tv before walking over to the bus station to catch our sleeper bus down to Bangalore.

The bus to bangalore was a unique and new experience for us, this wasn't a regular coach in that you sat in a seat, oh no, you got a double bed to share!..WOW!!!. this actually was a great experience and facilitated a rather good kip and a cuddle which is unusual on a night bus! I didnt want to think about the health and safety aspect but we made it no problems whatsoever, probably best we were able to sleep so couldnt hear all the horns and feel the swerving of the bus all night making our minds race!

We arrived in Bangalore at 6am from the sleeper bus. The hotel we were checking into was a 24hour hotel which meant we would have to check out
24hours later with our next bus at 7pm that night. We asked to add some hours on and the reception man responded with somewhat a dr.Evil laugh followed by a firm 'NO', great!...As not to dwell we got to our box room and had some kip, we were going to need it!...we got a few hours kip and headed out to see what Bangalore had to offer.

First thing was not being able to get a tuk tuk, then the one we found refused to even agree on a price anywhere near what we been advised to pay by the hotel...this wasn't looking good. Finally after asking about 5 taxi drivers and arguing over 50p and 1pounds (it's the principle) we got moving to the main shopping area for some air con action and 'stuff'. Stuff to us means anything western we can look at or even eat. Just as a change from what we had been having, and the ability to buy toiletries. We decided Pizza Hut would be a nice treat -I have no idea why when I don't eat Pizza Hut at home -but it was there and it was western, we had had local food
Bangalore
for 6 weeks so we gave it a go. We ordered the royal pizza, what a mistaka to maka!..YUK! we regretted it almost instantly, our poor tummies were not used to processed rubbish in those pizza's. We felt sluggish, full, had cramps and generally came to wonder what they actually put in processed food! I think we have been eating lots of pure foods for a couple of months that our bodies could not handle the crap found in a Pizza Hut pizza...lesson learnt.

We relaxed the rest of the day in preparation for the following long day to come. We got an early night and set our alarms for our 6am check out time.

At 6am we were up and ready and decided to have some breakfast then hang around the lobby for a couple of hours in the vain hope they would just give us a room...this was not going to happen so around 8am we headed to the botanical gardens and had a lazy wander looking at the pretty flowers and relaxed sanctuary away from the hustle and bustle of Bangalore. Another treat today was going to see the new spider man movie in 3D
Bangalore beautifulness
which was showing at the local cinema...getting there, walking around the mall, having lunch and watching the film killed some more time and before we knew it it was time for the bus.

This time the bus was a regular coach and it turned out to be a regular Indian journey, by Indian standards. This meant, lots of swerving whilst driving, emergency breaking, playing very loud music all night which meant we generally spent the time not very relaxed and feeling like we were being tortured as the music was so loud you couldn't sleep. I honestly think that 37 hour bus journey in Argentina killed my bum and sitting down for long time skills. After a couple of hours I couldn't do anything to get it not hurting-maybe if l eat some more pies/curry/masala dosa it will become more cushioned?

This is my first travel blog anywhere and would love to hear your feedback.

I will start with a brief introduction about Hampi.

Hampi is a village in northern Karnataka state, India. It is located within the ruins of Vijayanagara, the former capital of the Vijayanagara Empire. Predating the city of Vijayanagara, it continues to be an important religious centre, housing the Virupaksha Temple, as well as several other monuments belonging to the old city. The ruins are a UNESCO World Heritage Site, listed as the Group of Monuments at Hampi.

My friend Giri n myself headed for a weekend trip to Hampi towards end of Feb 2014. We travelledd by bus from Bangalore and was an 8 hours journey. On Saturday morning, we rented a motor bike and headed for seeing around Hampi. Ride from our hotel to Hampi was wonderful with an amazing view of paddy fields on one side of the road and sugar cane farms on the other side. We reached Hampi after an hour ride through the villages and farm lands, surounded by mountains.

We could see demolished and partly renovated Hindu temples in each and every corner of that old city. It is hard to
DSC05953
explain the architecture and stone art of those monuments. Each design looked better than the rest.Many of the monuments were destroyed by the Muslim invaders hundreds of years back and some are being renovated. Crowd was less as it was an off-peak season due to summer temperatures, close to 40 C .

Due to time constraints, we had to limit our visit to a few of the temples on the first day and on the second way we headed for the bear sanctuary which was a two hours ride and watched feeding the bears. Then we headed to Tunga Badra Dam to view the sunset, where we hiked a nearby hill to get a better view of the horizon. We were back at the hotel by 8 PM and it was almost the time to catch the return bus. We returned happily with minds full of memories about that beautiful city.

I have attached a few photos from my trip here. I hope you enjoyed it and please do leave your comments. Thank you.

Commerce continues despite the roadworks in downtown Gulbarga
The night passed without incident....a pre-ordered breakfast of Indian stuff arrived 20 minutes late, we part consumed, then set off. Stopped to visit a couple of tombs on the outskirts of town then on to Gulbarga.

In 1991 a man called Michael Kent wrote a detailed description of the Deccan sights, an interesting book though one which will detain no-one unless they David's interest in these matters. He mentioned that in Gulbarga, a foul and unpleaceable odour emanated from the fetid green moat. The moat has long since dried up but we can report that same odour now seems to engulf you wherever you go in the town.......more 14th century battlements, mosques etc, but we had to flee because of the stink.

The day however gets better because unbeknownst to us or our driver, Narendra Modi, the national leader of the BJP, the Hindu extremist-ish party, was holding an election rally in Gulbarga this very day. We had to go down the road where seemingly several hundred thousand of his flag waving supporters were massing. Lots of older gentlemen in Nehru caps and dhotis, lots of energetic youths, all of whom peered into our car looking and pointing at the two whities. David decided to respond with the wave perfected by H.M.Queen. Just the hour in a traffic jam then.......eventually we hit the road to Bijapur, across another 100 miles of featureless Deccani countryside. You have to earn your history and culture around these parts.

Bijapur. A name that resonates through medieval India history, but let's be honest, it is another dusty dump of a town these days. We check in to the Shashinag Residence, “the best hotel in town”. Oh dear God, standards are plumbing new depths here. James, we have now found a hotel lower than the Gaddafi era hotel we stayed in at Benghazi.........toilet window needing to be papered up, light fitting to be replaced.....probably built in the 80s and has not been dusted since. .....what a sh*thole. The people running it clearly know not the first thing about hotel management, though the resident biologist has cultured an interesting green algae not previously known to man in the “swimming” pool.....what a sh*thole. Some Indian youths were spotted disporting themselves in the pool this afternoon......a fleet of ambulances have just arrived at the hotel and a number of youths removed on stretchers....unrelated I am sure.

To our amazement we stumble into two other Europeans, who sadly turn out to be curt nodding and heel clicking East Germans, probably a shot-putting couple, who speak no English apparently other than “two beers” which they keep repeating frequently.

Dinnertime. We stumble into the “food bazaar” in the basement – perhaps they meant food bizarre? Anyway for once we are pleasantly surprised that the food is edible and some 24 hours on the bowels remain closed, so that is a positive. £3.20 for a lavish dinner including a litre of premium Kingfisher.

Somnathpur temple
Never again to see her sandals.....
Our last day in India was supposed to be a quiet day with nothing to do. Things don’t always turn out as planned.

Mr Ali advises us when we leave Mysore that our airport hotel in Bangalore is a 3 ½ hour drive away, so we ask to stop off at one more temple on the way. It’s a small but imposing 13th century temple with just a French woman and a group of three Indians as the only other visitors. As ever, we are told to leave our sandals at the entrance. We stack them neatly in a concrete compartment and look round the temple, which takes under 20 minutes. When we come to leave, Sara’s blue sandals have been replaced with a small black pair. Some mistake, surely? Gradually the awful truth dawns that her sandals are no longer there. We ask the man who purported to be the shoe attendant. He tells us the other visitors took the sandals and laughs. Sara does not find this amusing. We accost , in turn, the security guard, the ticket seller and a guide taking round three newly arrived Irish tourists. The gist of their replies is that none of
Mrs Bond in the Temple of Doom
them is to blame and nothing can be done. We enlist the help of Mr Ali who conducts vigorous conversations/arguments. Still the shoe attendant smirks and says looking after shoes is not his job and anyway, surely I have other footwear. David avoids the impulse to punch his face in, with difficulty.

Mindful of the need for a police report if we are to try to claim on the insurance, we ask where the police station is. The Somnathpur Police Out Post (sic) is a mere 200 yards away. Further discussion ensues between them and Mr Ali. They come with us to the temple and carefully search all round it, as if somebody might have just hidden the sandals as a joke. Nobody had. We ask for a police report and are told that has to be done by an inspector, at a bigger police station. We drive there. More discussion, with ever more people joining in in. Only one guy is in uniform but they all seem to be police officers. Eventually Sara is handed a blank piece of paper and asked to write out her ‘complaint’. She does so. Yet more discussion, and they all head off
David at Somnathpur
to a separate room – to file the report, we are told. They return and ask Sara to rewrite the complaint, this time describing the sandals as missing rather than stolen. Presumably this is to ensure their crime statistics (carefully recorded by year and type of crime on a blackboard) are not tainted by an unsolved sandal robbery. Finally someone appears who speaks some English. After checking several times that all we want is a record that we have reported to the loss to the police (ie no form of investigation) he makes further phone calls to someone called “sir” and tells us he will type up a report. This, he assures us, will take just 10 minutes.

As we sit waiting in the plastic chairs, we are kindly offered tea or coffee. We ask for our fallback request of ‘black tea no sugar’ which causes much consternation. After 15 minutes, two small cups of staggeringly strong white tea arrive, each with a quarter lemon which is pointed out to us with much pride. We accept with effusive thanks and, under the watchful eye of all concerned, squeeze out our lemons into the tiny cups of tea, which we

then drink with great shows of enthusiasm. Actually, the lemon serves to dilute the otherwise undrinkable concentrate of tannin into something halfway tolerable. After a further wait, the report is finally brought downstairs. All is not yet complete however. Sara has to sign one copy, and the desk sergeant has to sign and stamp it. The sheet is the folded with a flourish and put into an envelope for us. The English speaking officer (well, we assume he is an officer but as he’s not in uniform he could just be a helpful passer-by) informs us with a grin that we are the first foreigners they have ever had to deal with, they were not sure of the correct procedure to deal with foreigners and hence the call to Police HQ. This is also the first ever reported loss of footwear! The latter is probably not surprising as everyone we see seems to wear a 10 rupee pair of flipflops.

Emotionally exhausted, we pile back into the car and set off for Bangalore. The journey seems to be proceeding OK until we he hit the outskirts of the city and discover that the flyover/ring road has been closed as a result of the construction of an overhead metro line. This dooms us to the best part of 2 hours driving through the centre of Bangalore, a sort of urban hell, past the wholesale market and down narrow streets under the now closed flyover. Filth everywhere, cows wandering, cows and wretched humans alike sleeping in the filth on the central reservation. Traffic chaos and mayhem beyond description.

Finally we reach our ‘airport hotel’ at 4.45pm. Mr Ali has offered to drive us to the airport in the morning, as it is now too late for him to drive home today. We ask the unsmiling man at reception how long it will take to drive to the airport given we need to be there at 6am latest for an 8am flight. ‘One hour’ he replies. One hour, for an airport hotel???



Still, the good news is that the hotel is clean and the room comfortable (though it is a shame that there is an external light pointing straight into our bedroom through the exceedingly thin curtains). And a big bottle of Kingfisher is only 160 rupees (£1.60) for 650ml. We sit and drink while waiting for dinner sitting somewhat incongruously in a large dining room laid out with enormous wicker furniture which looks like it should be in the garden, and elaborate curtains with draped pelmets that should be in a country house. And bowtied waiters. Bizarre.

Pelican coming in to land
Mysore overall is a very pleasant city – wide avenues, fine municipal buildings, though of course very much an Indian city. On our last full day here we went early to the Ranganathittu bird reserve near to Sriringapatna on the Cauvery river. We paid for a trip in a boat with other people, declining a private boat for INR2000. Suddenly the price came down to INR1000 (£10) at which price we said yes. Surprisingly we were not offered a receipt, I wonder if the two rangers declared our payment to their boss?

The reserve comprises a number of small islands in the river. It is a beautiful serene place, with very few people if you arrive early. But peaceful it is not – instead the air is full of the sounds of thousands of birds cooing, cawing, screeching and generally calling to each other. On the boat, you get really close to them. Masses of photos taken with the long lenses, and of course lots of photos deleted later in the day in the search for the quality images.

On to Sriringapatna again as David wanted to explore where the East India Company army made their breach in the
Nest building stork
outer wall of the fort and sent in the two “forlorn hopes” to be the first to scale the breach and enter the fort during the 1799 battle. We found the obelisk commemorating the British soldiers who fell, and the breach was south of there. We reckon we found the section, took the photos to prove it. It is fascinating to find a site like this, as it was 215 years ago when our boys came over the breach and took the cold steel to the enemy. The Wodeyars (the Maharajas of Mysore since the British reinstated them after killing Tipu in 1799) were very well inclined to the British, but the whole site is so sadly dilapidated. On the other hand it means you can see it in an unsanitised form.

Back into Mysore. Sara is indulging David today, we eventually find and visit the Mysore Railway Museum. Billed as the second biggest railway museum in India, we were expecting something rather grand given the size and importance of Indian railways. In fact it is comical, very amateurish, but rather fun. You know a site is rarely (never?) visited by foreigners when there is no “foreigner” ticket price
The trainspotter
and the little man behind the counter looks stunned to see you.

We feel ridiculously proud of the fact that this morning we have had Mr Ali take us to three different sites he has never visited or taken tourists to before (and probably never will again!) He probably thinks we are completely mad. As he said, ‘most people just go temple’.



Hot and sticky, we retire to the hotel and rest before setting out again with the faithful Mr Ali to try and visit the Devaraja market. We fail to find it, visit some other market, and decide we have had enough. Time for a beer back at the hotel, where we have take full advantage of happy hour each evening.

puja offerings at the temple
Sunday morning. David is still recovering from Everton’s loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup. Continuing to meet our craving to eat something different, we reverse yesterday’s move from Indian to European food, and swap out the toast and omelette breakfast of the last ten days for an Indian breakfast of wada, sambur, yoghurt and lassi.

Mr Ali, reliable as ever, collects us at 9am and we head to the Chamundi Hills which overlook Mysore. At the top is an old temple, still in use and absolutely heaving with people as today is Sunday and hence a day off. Mr Ali informs us that people start arriving at 5am. We decide not to join the queue, but instead wander back to the car through the numerous stalls selling trays of fruit and flowers for temple offerings and a range of cheap plastic toys and souvenirs. Next stop is yet another Nandi bull temple, and then we go to the Lalitha Palace.

This is now a hotel, and if you just read their website you’d be very tempted to stay there and enjoy the experience of staying in a palace. Sadly, this one is run by the Indian government and
Lalitha Mahal Palace faded grandeur
not the Taj group. The money available for restoration was clearly inadequate and the place presents a picture of faded grandeur, heavily scuffed around the edges. It boasts an ancient lift with an opulent sofa for important people and a grand dining room (once the ballroom). We wander upstairs and a cleaner offers to show us the Viceroy suite where, he claims, Prince Charles and Lady Diana once stayed. It costs £500/night now and definitely did not look worth it. Our 100 rupee entrance fee included a cup of coffee, so we sat in the deserted coffee lounge and were served in solitary splendour. There was no sight of even a single guest.

In the afternoon we headed for Mysore Palace, built at the start of the 20th century after the previous palace burnt down. It’s a hugely imposing building from the outside, but visiting proved a trial. We were elbowed aside brutally in the queue to buy a ticket, and even our finely honed London bus stop skills failed to solve the problem. Once in, we found it was necessary to remove our shoes and check them in. Next stop was the security gate, where we were told
Mysore palace
we could not take our cameras in. They were supposed to left by the main entrance thought there was nothing to tell us this was the case. By now we were barefoot and a fair distance from the main entrance. The security guard suggested that for 40 rupees (the fee for checking in the cameras, he assured us) we could take them in if they were in a bag. We had no bag. After much discussion, he vanished and reappeared with a small flimsy black plastic bag into which we gingerly placed our two large Canon cameras, topped by a hat. The bag was clearly not going to bear the weight of the cameras for more than 20 seconds, so Sara had to clutch it to her body, holding it from the underside.

Once in the palace, we joined a long winding queue of visitors. The main attraction is the three large durbar halls, decorated in a bizarre mix of English art deco (the architect was British) and ancient Hindi and Islamic designs. Most of the rooms had turquoise as their main colour theme, and were impressive if not exactly tasteful. In the second hall, we became aware of
Sara with another nandi
a security guard calling after us. Oh no, we thought, he’s realised we have cameras in the bag and is about to expel us or extort more money. We ignored him and marched on, pointing with feigned interest at things – anything – in the opposite direction. All was in vain as he caught up with and grabbed David’s arm. ‘Have you seen the elephants over there?’ he asked? Bewildered, we said no. 'Maharajah's personal elephants you want see I take you'. He had flagged us as foreigners with no guide, and was seeking to offer his services as a guide no doubt for an outrageous fee. We escaped.



Once out of the palace, we headed for our shoes, only to find we were required to walk all the way round the outside of the palace – still barefoot, on a very hot surface – in order to be funnelled past the elephant and camel ride options (treading carefully around the piles of camel and elephant poo, both of which are found in significant sized deposits). Nice. Finally reunited with our footwear, ignoring the abuse of the shoe man claiming money while standing in front of a sign 3ft high saying it was a free service, we relocated Mr Ali and returned to the hotel to cool down and take advantage of happy hour.

David at Tipu Sultan's summer palace
We drive south through the rice paddies from Hassan. We ask Mr Ali to take us via Sharavanabelagola where there is a massive statue of a Jain saint on a hilltop. We arrive, gaze up at the 660 steps which you must ascend barefoot, and decide to give it a miss. The guide book suggests it’s a 2 hour round trip, barefoot up the rock which heats up. We return to the car, surrounded by aggressive hawkers and beggars clawing at us. We leave this unpleasant place.

Sringapatnam. There are many ways to spell this town, but it was the site of the famous battle in 1799 when Tipu Sultan (he who owned the famous mechanical tiger now in the V&A Museum in London) was killed by the forces of the East India Company. The story was told in one of Bernard Cornwell's “Sharpe” books and David was keen to try and identify the key sights from the book. Sadly, the British demolished most of the fort subsequent to the battle before handing the rule of Mysore state to their puppet maharajah. All that is left are some sad ruins gates and pieces of wall, overgrown and often covered with
dungeon at Sringapatam
rubbish. David did though discover the Water Gate where Sharpe supposedly killed Tipu. Mr Ali was completely puzzled by our behaviour, clearly not too many of his guests behave in this strange way. We also found the dungeon where Colonel Baillie and other British prisoners were held, some for up to fifteen years between 1784 and 1799.

There are also the remains of Tipu's summer palace, beautifully decorated inside but in need of some serious renovation, and the mausoleum that Tipu built for his father Haider Ali, where he is now buried alongside him.

Now it is time to move on the last few miles to our hotel in Mysore. After reading generally poor Tripadvisor reviews on the hotel we were booked into in Mysore, we swapped to a 4 star place in town that costs a mere £30/night. So far it is looking like a good choice – a clean room, internet in the room and a good restaurant. We’ve been away 25 days and had one European meal in the whole of that time. Today felt like the day to extend that to two, and we thoroughly enjoyed our late lunch of a club sandwich with
another day, another photo call
chips.



David has spent the last half hour trying to find an online fed of the Everton v Arsenal match, only for Sara to scroll through the multitude of channels on the satellite box and locate a channel showing the match live. His nerves are jangling, Sara is happily enjoying the chance to check the internet.

Our fan club at Halebid temple
A gentle day today, probably just as well as we were both exhausted after two days of route marching in the midday sun around Hampi. A 9am start proved to be just as well after it took 45 minutes for breakfast to arrive. Who’d think scrambled egg and toast was such a complicated order?

Belur and Halebid are about an hour’s drive away (no hotels recommended anywhere nearer). Both have 11th and 12th century temples, amongst the greatest in India, built by the Hoysala kings, with an extraordinary quantity of exquisite sculpture. Bangles on a dancer’s wrist that move, despite all being carved out of a single piece of stone, 64 elephants marching in a ground level frieze, every one different to the next, dancing girls, gods, demons, mythical beasts, pillars covered with carvings – the list goes on. Both temples were truly beautiful, but we were feeling the effect of the heat and our previous exertions. The guide seemed determined to describe every single sculpture to us, in considerably more detail than we really wanted or needed. The pace and the script were set by the guide showing round a French couple just ahead of us. It rapidly became
Belur temple
clear that every description and every poor joke was identical, while off-the-cuff questions did not get much of an answer. David was so entranced by the carvings that he kept asking subsidiary questions and took 180 photos of them, while Sara sat on a step nursing the remains of a migraine. Heavier than usual photo editing required this evening!

At Halebid, the world’s largest school party was on tour. Round about 100 small children in their neat little uniforms aged probably no more than 6 or 7 were being shown around at breakneck pace, in a long winding crocodile. We made the mistake of saying hello to one of their number who felt brave enough to accost us. Instantly they stopped their march and we were mobbed, with every remaining child wanting to greet us and shake our hands. The noise level rose to deafening proportions, while helpless teachers looked on unable to restore control. Even our guide seemed rather bemused patting one or two of them on the head. Eventually, duty done, we continued on our blow by blow tour of the temple, which features 2 huge statues of the bull Nandi on whom the god Shiva rides
Mrs Thomas has had enough.......
through all eternity. By this time, as David continued his quest for the shooting the perfect image, Sara had reverted to her repeated “er ehr” and “mm , yes” responses when we were told “this is a masterpiece of our temple madam” about yet another sculpture, while her idiot husband compounded the delay by taking yet another photo.......



Back to the hotel, even Mr Ali declared it hot today.

Chitradurga fort
Hampi to Hassan

If you are thinking of driving from Hampi to Hassan, be aware that the roads are pretty awful in places. One can see why this is a less well trodden route, most people jacking out of Karnataka at Hampi and taking the train to Goa. Not us though, we were off to see the great temples at Belur and Halebid, which necessitates this drive south. On the way we stopped at Chitradurga, to see the fort situated atop seven adjacent boulder strewn hills. The hill has seemingly been fortified for millennia and fell to Hyder Ali of Mysore in 1780 who lopped off the defeated king's head and stole all his treasure in time honoured Indian fashion. He was then succeeded by his son Tipu Sultan who further fortified the place and was in turn killed by the British at the battle of Seringapatam in 1799, of which more on a later day.

Clearly not many foreigners come here, as we had to wait five minutes as the ticket man rummaged around in his drawers to find the foreigner tickets wrapped in a dusty plastic bag. The fort walls are built of massive stone blocks pieced
Marauding macaques
together without mortar and for some reason it reminded me of the walls of Mycenae. We were trailed round continually by locals and were stopped more than once for the “please one photo” routine. All very friendly though, handshakes all round with me (not with Sara though, women don’t shake hands in India it seems). We got as high as we could in the heat as of course it was midday and sweltering, then admitted defeat and descended, trailed for a white by nasty mangy little macaque monkeys who seemed to specialise in stealing water bottles.



Back to the car, four hours bouncing over roads that were not so much pot-holed as cratered, and here we are in Hassan. Rarely has a three star hotel felt so luxurious.

Hampi stone chariot
It is difficult to convey the scale of Hampi. A city of 500,000 people, one of the great trading centres of the world in the 15 and 16th centuries, visited by merchants from England, Europe, the middle East and China. Devastated, pillaged and destroyed by vengeful Muslims from the Deccani sultanates after Talikota in 1565 (as the guide kept telling us ad nauseam), and then abandoned and overgrown by the jungle until discovered by an intrepid Englishman on his horse in the 19th century. And now a World Heritage Site, little known outside India.

Massively long and wide colonnaded market avenues lead up to temple complexes of the 14th to 16th centuries. The temples were also social centres, so you find a dining and dormitory building, a consultation hall, a music and dancing hall and an inner sanctum where the deity would be worshipped in most of the temples. The level of carving varies in quality, as does the level of iconoclasm indulged in by those vengeful Muslims.

The light is rather dead as the day is overcast so the whole impression is one of a rather grey coloured city, the building and massive boulders all around blending one
Intrepid explorer
into the other, but with the vivid greens of the paddies and the palm groves counterpointing the grey, the river meandering through adding another dimension. The whole thing feels immense, a lost civilisation recovered from the jungle.

The temperature is passing 30C and rising and our guide suggests a drift down the river in a coracle powered by a nut brown and gnarled boatman to another temple complex. A relief from a half hour walk, we take the coracle as people have done for thousands of years, past reed beds and riverside shrines, the massive boulders all around.

The magnificent Vitthala temple is one of the grandest and home of the iconic stone chariot that features on all promotional pictures of Hampi. A magnificent vehicle, frozen now but capable of movement if it is was let free. Quite unique.

It is now over 35C and time to visit the Royal Quarter, the palaces of the kings and queens, unfortunately all gone apart from their ornate stone plinths as they were all built of fragrant sandalwood and so all burnt in the sack of the city. We see the elephant stables where the royal nellies were kept, and
Temple emerging from the jungle
the queen's palace where she was attended by her vast coterie of ladies and guarded by her faithful eunuchs. Only the intrepid Brits are out in the midday sun, all ridiculously attired in one way or another and exchanging a polite “good morning” in some sort of show of solidarity in the face of adversity (etiquette has to be maintained you know).

One last photographic vista and it is back to the hippie cafe for lunch. Some quick ruthless bartering by Sara for some earrings, no pestering today by the “photo sadhus” who recognise a lost cause when they see one, an invitation from a fierce looking transvestite to enter her shop which is politely declined, assorted beggars and that man who is trying for the second day to sell us a flute on which he plays the first few bars of Titanic.

Mr Ali then takes us to his home for a cup of the strongest tea we have ever drunk, introducing us to his wife and daughter. Sara asks the teenage daughter her age, occasioning a fit of giggles and causing her to hide. The only common ground she could find with Mr Ali’s wife was
At leisure in the coracle
to note that her ewing machine was very similar to the 1952 Singer sewing machine Sara inherited from her mother. This went down very well. A small crowd gathers at the door to stare and giggle at the two overheated Englanders. We bid farewell amongst much waving and further giggles, and return to the hotel.



An amazing place seen by a route march in blazing heat that our forebears would have been proud of.

Hampi
The drive from Badami to Hampi is only about two hours. Early excitement as we track two guys on a motorbike carrying a pane of glass at right angles to the direction of travel so it acts as a great big windbreak. They nearly come off as they swerve over a speed bump, but we get bored as they seem to have the hang of it and are not going to fall off, so we tell Mr Ali to speed up. The land is fertile and the trees a mix of deciduous trees and palm trees, coconut and banana groves abound, as do fields of sugar cane and rice paddies. Gone are the fields of wheat and cotton. The temperate climbs again, as does the cloud cover. “Cool today” says Mr Ali. “Only 30, when warm 45”.

Hampi. 29sq km of abandoned 16th century city, the ancient capital of the Vijayanagar empire that was defeated in 1565 at the Battle of Talikota by a confederacy of sultanates from the Deccan to the north, after which the city was sacked for six months and then abandoned. The buildings are scattered amongst massive granite outcrops where you can still see the lava
Carrying glass on a motorbike
flows sitting where they hardened in place. Trees are lacking and in the midday heat (when inevitably we are out and about), it presents a surreal landscape, not to mention a physical challenge as we slip and slide over smooth rock slopes with our hitherto loose fitting clothes plastered to us in the heat. Sweat is salty and it’s impossible to drink enough. But it’s worth it to see the sheer magnificence of this once proud city.

It’s the first place we have encountered any Western tourists in numbers, but Hampi has clearly made it onto the hippy/gap year backpacker trail. Mr Ali deposits us at a backpacker cafe and tells us to meet him at the car park in an hour. Mr Ali knows best so we agree to do so, while probably he pops home as he lives in the next village, which is fair enough. The cafe is run by Nepalis and serves tasty food of the sort that saved our lives in Tibet where the local food was unspeakable. The young things who were hanging out in the cafe were lounging on comfortable cushions and mats on the floor, but the old people were shown
Haven't you got jobs to go to
by the waiter to a table and chairs, he correctly surmising we would not have been very comfortable on the floor. We were at least 35 years older than anyone else in there. We think that the place is a bit out of the 70s but there is no smell of weed drifting around, even the hippy types seem cleaner living these days. After splurging £3 on lunch we fill in the rest of the time by drifting round the shops selling clothing for backpackers and leather goods that will stink the place out when you get them home and realise they have not been properly cured. Fake sadhus wander around offering to have their photo taken for money. We decline.

Once reunited with Mr Ali and the blissfully air conditioned people carrier, we set off to visit sites that we will not go to with the guide tomorrow. Mr Ali’s local knowledge comes in very handy, and most of the sites we visit are deserted. Along the way we see Western tourists toiling up hills on bicycles or risking life and limb on hired motorbikes. All have bare arms and legs and no hats or head protection. Many sport alarming displays of sunburn. There will be a few cases of heatstroke tonight in the backpacker hostels.

The Vijayshree Resort.......a slightly odd place, bungalows set about 100 yards from the main building. The bungalow is in my mind what a Colonial administrator would have stayed in during the Raj while touring his area of responsibility, all a bit faded but basically OK.



We go to dinner, no alcohol here so it is lime soda tonight. Sara recoils with horror when she sees the outside dining area with low tables and people sitting on the floor flapping away the mosquitoes, but relief when we are lead to the European's dining room. Indian TV burbles on in the background, David may have to switch it off soon. Meanwhile, outside we hear the beat of drums. The hotel is, in fact, not a mere resort but a heritage village, offering a range of faux rural Indian pastimes for the Bangalore city dwellers – camel rides, dancing and goodness knows what else. They don’t have camels in Karnataka, but let's not quibble.

Badami rock temple
Strange things happen.... as we sit in the lobby/dining room of our hotel (only place with wi-fi) under the cooling breeze of a fan, a small white rabbit has just ambled past. And left, presumably not wishing to be spotted by the cooks.

Badami is famous for its rock temples, hewn and carved out of massive sandstone cliffs. For once, we don’t need the sensible hats that cause so much derision, as the temples are in shade first thing in the morning. Today we have a guide, recommended to us by our guide at Hyderabad and charging a modest £9 for three hours. There’s no doubt you see and appreciate a lot more with guide, even though yesterday we were so hot we just wanted to keep going and would not have paid attention to explanations of the nine incarnations of Vishnu etc . This guide was good, explaining the place without going into five minute lectures on Indian gods every time he showed us a different carving. The views as we gradually ascended the cliff were impressive, looking across to more cliffs and giant boulders, and down to the man made lake (tank) built in the sixth century to
Market in Badami
provide a water supply but now sadly too polluted to be drunk. Instead, a man was washing his ox, and some women were scrubbing rugs, laid out to dry on the steps.

We stopped off in the market to buy some more oranges (emergency lunch supply of fruit and biscuits is always a good idea in case there is nowhere obvious for lunch). From time to time the sheer overwhelming combination of noise, smells, bustle and apparent chaos can be slightly overwhelming. You realise you cannot hear anything other than a background deafening roar, and in a place like this where there are far more Europeans you do not get noticed so much, so you can sort of drift through in a slightly disembodied way. Overlapping images of piles of vegetables, fruit, spices, plastic tat, food stalls, rubbish, rummaging black pigs, and the occasional monkey trying to steal things and being chased off by a stick wielding store holder fill your vision. And all the time that din and the heat beating down on you as the clothes stick to your back and you seek out the shade.

Finally we climb up to one last temple, past a
baby bunny
group of children seemingly mixing cement for some unknown use. The gardener followed us up and opened the temple for us. It’s still in use and he told us he goes every morning to make his puja. He asked anxiously what we thought of the gardens, and beamed when we admired them.

Back to the hotel for a much needed shower and lunch, followed by a relaxing afternoon reading and sorting photos. We're staying at the Krishna Heritage hotel and it is a wonderful oasis of calm, with great service. The mystery of the white rabbit resolved itself when the manager appeared clutching two tiny brown rabbits by the scruff of their necks and proceeded to feed them milk. He explained that they are wild orphans which he is bringing up, but the white rabbit is one he has boiled ..... no, we misheard, one he has bought as a pet and not for the pot.

dual carriageway lane discipline
The day breaks in dusty disgusting Bijapur. I awake and contemplate the brown smears on the bedroom wall.....just what is that substance? Best not to think, get up shower, and give thanks that the bowels have held up after last night's delicious dinner – 1.5l of beer, 8 biscuits (cost 10p per packet) and six bananas. We could not face the food bizarre downstairs. We had tried room service; a man appeared with a grease stained menu card. “Is not our menu is someone else's, food not same prices not same but maybe similar”. Excellent salesmanship you will agree. We gave up at that point and took comfort in beer.

By 8am we are packed and ready to flee but Mr Ali the driver does not start till 830am. But at 825am we espy him and run to the car, flinging our cases in. The management do not even bother to check us out, and fortunately for them they did not ask us if we had enjoyed a pleasant stay or we would have unburdened ourselves.

Off we roll across more miles of God's ironing board, the Deccan plateau. The road is a good four lane highway and we
Pattadakal temples
make excellent time. We practise that well known Indian custom of driving the wrong way down the dual carriageway when Mr Ali needs some fuel on the other side of the road. Add that one to the CV.

Aihole (pronounced “Ay –ho – lay,” sorry to disappoint) is a cluster of temples built from the 5th to the 8th centuries. Crumbling sandstone, but very evocative and with some beautiful carvings. In one place the temples are actually in a village, with houses and temples cheek by jowl. Pattadakal, a few miles on, is more sanitised as it is a World Heritage site, so better maintained. The villagers there were relocated. By the time we arrive the temperature has soared to well over 30C, and of course we are out in the midday sun as we are British, and that is what we do. We are grateful for the chance periodically to shelter inside the temples. For some reason, David's stylish hat occasions great mirth amongst a group of young Indian ladies. No idea why........our last stop is a Hindu temple complex out of town, clearly a Nandi shrine, as stone bulls are everywhere. The smell of incense hangs heavy
Playing in the 6th century water tank
in the air. There is an ancient water tank, full of dozens of boys and youths messing about and shouting. We get a lot of stares here, as if we have stumbled into a world where we do not belong.



At last we reach out next hotel, a calm oasis in the countryside that is clean, spacious and welcoming. We settle gratefully onto our balcony, whilst keeping an eye open for the monkeys we are told will enter our rooms unbidden if given the chance, and just steal whatever they can lay their hands on......makes a change though doesn't it?

Bidar fort gate

We lingered in the comfort and luxury of the Falaknuma for as long as we could this morning, but eventually it was time to say goodbye and set off on the second half of our journey. Our new driver was waiting for us, in an identical Toyota Innova people carrier to the last one. After a slight hiccup when he took the wrong road, we were soon on the highway for a mere 3 hour drive to Bidar. We have just one night here, partly because it would have been a very long journey to our next destination if we’d driven direct from Hyderabad, and partly to see the fort.

Luckily the driver knew his way round the fort. You enter through the 14th century city walls, which are about 10km long and encircle a large area. We drove along the main road, which would once have been the main shopping street, and stopped first at a huge mosque that had been mostly destroyed by an explosion in 1672. The local children were just leaving their madrassa and getting onto their various buses, so we spent a lot of time saying hello and answering the same old questions: ‘What
Bidar fort
is your name?’, ‘Where are you from?’

Next up was the fort itself which is huge and impressive. Our guide in Hyderabad said he had spoken to someone who would unlock the various buildings. Whether or not it was the same person, an old fellow with a key appeared out of nowhere. We looked round another mosque with an Indian family for company. They left, and our guide led us into two separate palaces. Restoration work seems to be taking place slowly and patchily, and we were grateful to have a guide to lead us through the labyrinth of corridors and stairs (including one in pitch darkness that David found especially unamusing). We wandered round some more distant ruins, overheating steadily even though it was 4.30 by now. Back at the entrance, we thought we’d seen everything, but our driver summoned another key holder who took us round yet another palace, this one with bright tiling and amazing carved wood all dating back to the 1400s. It’s extraordinary it could have survived so long given the monsoons. There were very few visitors and, needless to say, no other foreigners. Once again we were much in demand for photos.
Suite at the Sapna Continental

Fort tour complete, it was time to find our hotel. To say Bidar is a dump would be kind. We drove up and down the main street, which outdoes most other Indian streets in looking dirty and unfinished, and eventually found a small grimy sign for the Sapna Continental hotel, handily located above a clothing store and a shop selling TVs. Much discussion ensued at the front desk who claimed we had no reservation despite our pre paid voucher. Mercifully the driver conducted the discussion in Telugu, the local language, and called the travel agent for us. Eventually all was sorted and we were led to our room. Or, more precisely, our suite, complete with a large seating area, two sofas and a mock marble table and chairs for six. Execrable taste but it was clean – such a relief! Though the lack of any hot water till 6am next morning was less pleasing. The manager offered to bring hot water upstairs by the bucket load but somehow that didn’t seem like much of a solution...

The hotel has no restaurant, but dinner can be ordered in and served on the marble table. £3 for the two of us
Luxury repast
produced a tray with 4 foil bags (potato curry, pea and paneer curry, rice and nan) 2 bags purporting to contain lime juice and 2 bottles of soda water. Since lime juice should be clear we didn’t have the lime sodas as, once mixed, a strange orange scum rose to the surface. The food tasted fine but nagging doubts about hygiene remain – fingers crossed and sphincter muscles tightened........





It’s 9.00pm. The TV options comprise Bollywood serials, old sport of various sorts or – most bizarrely – WWF wrestling. I feel an early night beckoning.......... but wait, there’s a National Geographic programme on Komodo dragons, not to mention the last 15 minutes of last week’s Everton match at Chelsea which David watched glumly.

Last view of Varkala beach. It was a bit old hippie. But they were harmless and I liked them.
Right, a bit of a preamble: I actually wrote the bulk of this about two weeks ago, and had thought about rewriting it, but decided to leave it the same but add some postscript so this text and the pictures might be a bit disjointed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello everyone, as always I hope you are all well.

A fairly short entry this time round, not to say that stuff hasn’t happened, because it has, but it is just not quite as much stuff as on previous posts.

Or, let me flip that a bit. I have been suspecting for sometime that things that would have filled me with novelty on the previous trip are now pretty much matter of course and so I don’t report on them. I remember on my last trip I would report on things such as frogs in toilets, cows on the streets, the laughable driving, regular power cuts. Things that would intrigue and entertain me have slowly become…..normal.

I must try and reverse this as many of the readers of this current blog were not readers before, so I must make more of an effort to capture these things that define a

good old fashioned developing country. But please don’t think that I am taking anything for granted I am not, I am deeply appreciative of my current lifestyle.

Does that make sense? I hope so.

But. To complicate things a bit further, I also suspect that I have not really been off the beaten track that much since coming to India. The funny thing about the beaten track is that when you are off it you wish you were on it, and, many times, when you are off it you wish you are on it again. Like all things in life it is all about balance.

Anywoo. So. Last time I left you in Varkala. I liked that town. Which I why I stayed for two weeks. But I did finally leave to head to Cochin to meet a friend called Zane. I met Zane on the Turkey to Iran train (you always meet the best people on trains, especially in remote areas). It turned out Zane was going to be in the North of India, I was going to be in the South, so we decided to meet up half way.

I really enjoyed my time
IMG_0811
Every house or shop has a little shrine area.
with him, he is interested in stuff, I am interested in stuff, so we had much stuff in common. I have a natural fear and suspicion of technology, he on the other hand embraced technology as an aid that can enhance life. I spent much time warning him that the satellites could fall from the sky and the Internet could breakdown whilst happily following his GPS I Phone and using his various apps to help me identify various onward travel options.

He had to carry on down South to meet up with a tech company developing a gravity light (Google it) and I had to make up South to Goa, Via Mangalore, to meet with another traveling partner.

I met a lass called Neriman when working on the farm in Turkey and I got an E mail about a month ago to say she was heading to India so we decided to meet up in Goa.

Not quite sure where we will go but that is fine. India is that sort of place, just play it by ear. She has some friends who live up in the North of Goa so I think we will head there

A popular Ice Cream make here is Uncle John. I have two Uncle Johns. And as I write this I am reminded that I am also an Uncle John. To those who know all three of us, which Uncle John does this chap look like most? Answers on a postcard.
at some point. Not sure how long we will travel together, it is very hard to know these things.

So……I am enjoying India, but I am conscious I am yet to see the “real” India. I have had to deal with a few beggars, seen a small amount of public street defecation but I continue to be reminded that Kerala and Goa are not really the real India. Fear not peeps, I will…….I will.

Oh, I also meant to say that the great thing about India is that you can get off the beaten track just by catching a bus twenty minutes in any direction. You don’t need to go to the disputed territory of Kashmir or the lawless bandit country of Mizoram to get away from Westerners, just catch a bus to a town that is not mentioned in the Lonely Planet. Oh don’t get me started on the Lonely Planet…..maybe that is a rant for another time….

All my love.

John-Jo

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ok, so now for the postscript..

So, met with Neriman and had lots of fun in Goa but I have decided I can’t spend any more time on the
IMG_0813
Mother Teresa holding a poor infant. They seems to have stuck her in a disco. The lights rotated. These Indians, they be crazy.
coastal beach places, six weeks is just about my limit. I cannot believe I am saying this but….I am bored of beaches.

I can now walk in any beach restaurant in Kerala, Goa or Karnataka and recite the menu without even looking. If I hear another Bongo drum I am going to cry. If someone tries to sell me another trinket they may end up in Hospital. After so many weeks in Beach Huts I am getting desperate for a change of scenery.

Neriman however is just at the start of her trip so these places hold the same appeal as they did for me when I arrived (remember the “life is a beach” comments, the endless photos of palm trees?). India holds so much interesting places I am at a point where I want to and explore a bit more.

I loves a good beach I do, but like all things in life you need a balance. We plan to meet up again later in the adventure because she is a jolly good lass and a fun traveling partner.

So, I decided to catch the 15 hour over night train (vomit) from Gokarna
IMG_0814

to Mysore as an attempt to break away from the coast. Blimey India is big. Google map Gokarna, then Google map Mysore. Ask yourself how it takes 15 hours. It looks like a quick jaunt up the road, but it isn’t.

I am also at the point where I need a break from the heat so I am going to try and find some hills soon. I want to stop sweating.

Those pesky North East States still seem to be calling me….But what folk don’t understand is that at the moment the North of India is very cold. And I mean very cold, so maybe these will have to wait until later on. But, I have a decent Interweb connection in my new place so I can spend some much needed time looking at the logistics of a trip up there.

So, there we are, a wee update. I really hope that the terrible weather you Brits are being subjected too isn’t getting you down. I have just seen the news for the first time in ages and it looks mighty bad.

I know that this has almost become a standard issue statement but I am

Hampi
Oh all we ever seem to do is catch a train. I am sure by now you guys are all trained out. I really like train travel and its all so comfortable and well organized. We met a couple in our compartment the husband lectures in tool and dye cutting and she is a professor of engineering/ they had recently been to South Africa so we had lots to talk about. Every youngster we speak to is studying engineering of some sort there is a glut of engineers here and so they in the end take on crappy jobs just to get a job often not even in their own field. And we have the problem in South Africa that we only have one place in Durban where they teach Tool and Dye cutting and that is a huge problem for us as we have to import all the tools we need and no one able to repair them. Very short sighted of our government to close those colleges.

Our meet and great rickshaw was waiting for us that is the first time I have ever had that service in India. We didn’t have to deal with the touts what
getting water
a pleasure Thanks Padma Guest house. First we had to try and confirm our onward journey as we were wait listed. We had moved up the ranks and were told we were now number 5 and 6 on the list but don’t worry we will definitely be on. Better had otherwise it might mean we would have to suffer a 10 hour bus drive and Terry would not like that at all and me too trains are so civilised.You can never go hungry or thirsty on a train journey. all the time you hear a food wallah coming up and down the corridor singing what they sell Chaaaaaai or lassi lassi, cooldrinks.,pani water then food calls biriyani, bajias of some kind or another.



We drove past a few villages up some hillocks and down into little vallies. Then a few ruined temples and then more and more until at last over the last hill and we had arrived at Hampi. It had a big dusty bus station – by this I mean an area where busses stopped nothing formal, with the cutest cart shops selling chai and fried snacks (always lots of fried stuff) like chillies in
lemonade seller
a bhaji batter that are quite nice once in awhile, and then a couple of rows of carts selling tourist stuff. Hampi is a very special place for locals to come on pilgrimage so its always busy.. On the opposite side there was a post office, school and a few guest houses where’s ours was. It was very nice basic but clean. We had breakfast muesli of a crude but tasty home made kind with big chunks of roasted coconut pieces, curd yoghurt ,honey and fruit (tourism city) then it was out to explore the town and we made arrangements for rickshaw driver for the afternoon to do some temple visits. The main section of the town was down the road closer to the river. The streets were mostly dusty and unpaved old houses all now converted into restaurants,guest houses, money changers, shops selling everything from clothes to leather goods and jewelry and of course bakeries selling western style munchies.A good money making venture by 3 older guys is to dress up in traditional clothes say you are a magic man and get photos taken for a hundred rupees. Good wicket guys!!! the only other thing that disturbs the peace
roof top restaurant
Bob Marley alive and well and played in every roof top restaurant
is an occasional steal of bananas by a cow might start a rumpus with the banana wallah.

We only did the free temples in the afternoon set over many miles its almost like Bagan with the multitude of buildings though very different style and of course religion. In many ways Anchor Wat is closer in religious terms. It was hot and dusty and thankfully we had our trusty rickshaw waiting for us after each temple visit. For sunset we were taken to a lovely spot on the hill where priests were chanting the Ramayana 24/7 there is never a break they never stop there are always 2 priests taking it in turns oh and using a microphone so its loud even if no one is there. Besides monkeys and dogs there were some beautiful wild vivid green parrots flying around and our guide said this is the only temple where they hang out and for sure they were the only ones we saw during our stay. The whole area is full of balancing rocks. Its like there was one huge explosion which I am sure there was and huge boulders of rocks were thrown into the atmosphere and then
the magic men
came and landed here some of them balancing in the most precarious way. In fact some of the temples too are balancing in a very precious manner too. The sunset did not disappoint either except for the few too many other people who came as well. Well not hectically but one always wants mostly solitude at these moments.



We knew exactly where we wanted to go for dinner as the word had it they sold special Lassi’s and the word was not wrong. Walking around the village after dinner was incredibly special. There is a special peacefulness amongst the mingling of cows, dogs, monkeys and people all in a very unhurried manner that is far away from the big cities. Tourism sure has changed this valley forever but not in a bad way at all. There is no alcohol so that for sure is a big factor. During the day there are many many local tourists who come to make puja. I was up before sunrise the chai shops were already crancking up so of course I had one to start the morning. Then I followed a bus load of pilgrims down to the river to watch
view
them bath and do their morning rituals. After bathing its off to the Temple.

All the women were wearing fresh flowers in their hair and everyone with fresh bhindi’s on their foreheads. As it was Republic Day the school children were all dressed up in clean uniforms, flag stickers pasted to their cheeks a few had flags. The school was being bedecked with banana fronds the main flag waiting to be unfurled. We could hear them from our guesthouse later singing and saying what I suspect were poems or stories. Everything is always done with microphones and on loud. That is the Indian way.

Terry had hung his bananas in a packet from the burglar bars in our room. The next thing we noticed they had gone. It must have been a monkey who came past and smelt them, broke the fly screen and stole them – would so have loved to have seen him in action the bugger so smart and as Terry says something he will never do again. The pay for Temples were more special of course and one building t that I really liked was a stable for the Kings elephants which I think
pretty green parrott
was one of the most beautiful. The roof was domed with about 9 domes and 3 different patterns of domes. The insides were decorated in stucco.The elephants had a view out of big doors ways that are now open. they could have been closed originally with wooden doors now long gone. Small openings for people to get through. The walls around this building were amazing all put together without mortice and reminded me so much of my travels to Cusco with Toni. How did they do it without the sophisticated tools we have today?



You stand amongst the ruins of passageways where shops once were, where a whole community lived, ate and prayed and one can only try and imagine the splendor which is nothing now compared to what it was.Yet so splendid in what remains.

We packed early and went for a last dinner and walk about this lovely town it would be a very early call the next morning 5 am departure as I am nervous and we needed to confirm we were on the train. So it was good bye Hampi and I am so glad we came - I loved this place

girls selling chili at the Devaraja Market
.....this is what lonely planet says about Mysore. Well, we are not really LP-fans - but this is certainly true. Mysore has everything South India is made of: tempels, pujas, lovely food, hot weather, friendly people, colonial buildings, honking, crazy markets, yoga, all kinds of smells and colours and, a highlight for us (after a long time without): nice cold local beer. This city is a feast for all sins. But come prepared and be ready to dive into this world - otherwise it will makes you crazy.

We were thinking a lot about going to Mysore. The last travelblogs about this city were not really enthusiastic. But in Wayanad, we spoke to so many people who simply loved their time in Mysore that we finally decided to check it out. And did we regret coming there? Of course not - we loved it and could have stayed much longer. It is crazy, it is stressful, colourful, mindblowing - I have no more english words to describe this city. But may be it is not my limited knowledge of english. You must experience this city, there are no words to describe it, no matter in which language. Well, at least
Mysore Palace on Sunday nights
Stunning!
I will try to write a bit about what we did.

First of all we were very lucky with where we stayed. As it was weekend, all the popular places had already been booked. Beena, our angel from Wayanad, found a cheap homestay for us a bit out of town: the Rooftop Retreat. We did not get this fantastatic rooftop apartment which is really a great deal for only 2.000 rupia. We had a very small but superclean room downstairs for only 1.000 rupia including free water and indian breakfast.The owners were very nice and helpful and with the ricksaw it is just a short ride to town. First of all we just walked around the center and got the real Mysore feeling by slowly walking through the Devaraja Market. What a wonderfully bustling bazaar full of traders selling traditional items such as flower garlands, spices and conical piles of kumkum. Of course there is also the typical tourist stuff - but you have to bargain hard. On our first visit we did not buy anything but took it just all in. Outside the market we found a music store and decided to buy some traditional music. We were
offerings for a puja
just standing inside listening to a CD when a cow walked passed and put her head into the store looking at us. This was so surreal for us (for the locals it must have been normal) - it was a good combination of the modern world and the tradition Mysore is made of. We had lunch at the travellers' famous Parklane Hotel which was nice, especially the cold beer. Since New Year we had not had anything else than water and tea (just because beer was not available), what a nice taste of the first sip! The next morning after a delicious homecooked breakfast at our homestay we went up to Chamundi Hill. This is one of the 8 most sacred hills in South India and there were some celebrations going on that day. So it was packed with people and, of course, cows. We made our way to the main entrance. Before entering the palace, we got a blessing and then could quickly walk through the tempel receiving a Darshan and another blessing inside. It was amazing to see how all this people were quickly led through the tempel, all receiving their darshans and blessings. An amazing experience and
Nina being blessed
we were really happy that we already know the meanings and rules of how to behave and what to do on such an occasion. Afterwards we descided to walk down the 1000 steps back to town. After halfway, you can see a big statue of Nandi, Shiva's vehicle. Back in town it was time for a late lunch before we did some big shopping which was good fun and we made some really good deals concerning clothes. Walking through the streets suddenly someone called our names. We turned around in surprise - well, the street was packed with locals, who is knowing us here anyway? A french couple we met in Wayanad was standing behind us. Funny. We would not have found us if we had tried to. But these guys were not the only ones we met....

The next day, sunday, we were ready for the Mysore highlight: a visit to the Palace. From outside, this palace really is spectacular. Around town there are more wonderful, colonial buildings giving the city a certain grandeur. But this palace really left us speechless (which is so difficult, as we both love talking ;-)). We entered the gardens and first visited
Nagarhole National Park
Can you spot the elefant we saw on our way from Wayanad to Mysore?
an old Vishnu Tempel which was also very beautiful and overall peaceful. As there are no photographys allowed inside the palace we first walked around the gardens taking some pics. In one shady corner of the park we saw some elefants. As Markus loves those animals, we went there. We got some elefant blessings (the elefant put his trunk on our heads and gave us a big blow with some awfully warm air). Finally, we could also sit on the elefant. We gave the guys a few rupia for this. Later we discovered that this was a real bargain for us. Even local tourists pay nearly the double price to sit on the elefant. How lucky we had been!

Of course, we also visited the palace. It was again packed with people and many school classes. But it was really beautiful with some amazing architectural details. We loved the detailed wood carvings with marble. And suddenly, just in front of us, were our friends from Belgium - the family we had met in Kannur a couple of days earlier. Spontanously, we had lunch together and spent the rest of the afternoon walking around town to some sandalwood shops and
indian breakfast @ Rooftop Retreat Homestay
also trying all the famous sweets in coffee shops. That was good fun and it was great to see you guys again - have a safe ongoing trip!

We ended our time in Mysore with one more highlight - a visit to the palace in the dark when it was illuminated by around 100.000 light bulbs. It was stunning! We felt like in Disneyland. The whole atmosphere was breathtaking. There, again, were many people, but all were happy and peaceful and we simply had a great time taking this all in. What a better way than ending a perfect day with a nice dinner on a roof top terrace at Gandhi Square.

Much too fast our time in Mysore was over. We had not expected to enjoy an indian city that much. Still there are a lot more things to see and do. But we decided to move on anyway. Our time is limited and some more interesting destinations are waiting for us. A bus was taking us up into the mountains again - over 2.000 meters into the heart of the Nilgiris.

Our next stop: the chilly and strange hill station of Ooty.


they collect the garbage in some areas of Mysore....
...but surely not in all...

We were in Mysore, 3 hours southeast of Bangalore, on our way to the government silk factory, when 3 cows across the street caught my attention. After 3 months in India, I usually don't notice cows anymore. We've seen cows in the city, cows standing on a thin grassy median surrounded by relentless Indian traffic, cows on the beach, cows on the train station platform, cows in restaurants, cows in temples. Big cows, little cows, camel cows, cows with painted horns adorned like an Indian bus, sleeping cows, walking cows, stampeding cows, frisky cows, even self-pleasuring cows (seriously). I usually don't give them a second glance.



But these cows were yellow!

I don't know why they're yellow, or how they're yellow. All the white spots on the cows we saw in Mysore were dyed yellow.

There was a tree blooming with yellow flowers, and we thought that might have been used to dye the cows' white hair. But we're not really sure.

We were in Mysore during the last week of January. There there were no festivals we knew of going on that week. But in India, there are always festivals and holidays of various religions and cultures that we often know nothing about.

Why were all the cows yellow?

Palace in Mysore
The road down the mountain towards Mysore was rough and rugged but travelled through National reserves so we were entertained with flocks of pretty spotted deer, a baby elephant being washed in a stream and a group of very cute black faced monkeys who had decided to come down to the road to watch the humans and play a game of chicken on the road. They observed us as much as we observed them. The road became much better once we hit the flats and we motored quickly to Mysore, pausing once to admire the pelican elegantly fishing in a lake and a group of pelicans nesting up in the trees. Once we arrived in Mysore we headed directly to the palace. The place was teeming with tourists and we learned from Antony that it was the 'number one' palace in India, and second most popular tourist attraction after the Taj Mahal. We were not allowed to take photographs and in fact could not even take a camera inside. The bag screening indicated that Sue had a camera and security were insisting that she take it to security until a guard called Roy over and said that it was okay and she could keep her camera but not take photographs for a tip. Roy handed over the hundred rupees explaining to the guard that this was a bribe/ not a tip - the guard was happy whatever the language, Sue was happy that she kept her camera, so we popped off our shoes and headed in. Firstly we got herded into a line by a very officious elderly gent with a stick which he banged on the floor, banged in the pole and waved at us yelling and gesturing to us in Indian. It was quite strange to be treated like cattle but also very funny. We were basically herded through the entire place in a long snake of tourists which was okay except if you needed to go through a door and these became very claustrophobic as everyone tried to jump the queue. The palace was spectacular and is the official residence of the Wodeyars, the royal family of Mysore who ruled for over seven centuries. I have put in a link as we had very little information about it and became quite interested. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore_PalaceAnother 5 star dinner- to bed.

We have a rental space!

Anusha's family have agreed to rent us a room they own at only 1200 rupees per month (about AUD$24). This is a fantastic achievement given that the rent in the village is usually over 2000 rupees per month.

For two months we will occupy a smaller room on the top floor of their house, until the current tenant of the larger room moves out. The larger room is a separate dwelling on their property, with an attached bathroom.

We are all thrilled about this.

On the facilitator front, we have one great candidate named Apoorva. She is about to start her Masters in Science, and has a fantastic grasp on English. Her father is also very supportive, we just hope she will be able to fit Pod into her busy schedule!

I'm loving all your comments and feedback, so please keep them coming!

Breakfast at Oberoi
We are still swanning around in luxury; lovely Thai dinner last night, pedicures, swimming in the pool, sitting enjoying a drink at the al fresco bar and delicious complimentary breakfast. The staff are just lovely and did I mention the beds? Goose down pillows and duvets, crisp clean sheets and thick luxury towels- oh so mmmmmmmm.... We did however tear ourselves away to go sightseeing this morning and then some last minute shopping. Bangalore is ( according to the guide) the largest city in India with a population of close to 2 million. It is much cleaner and much more modern than other cities we have visited. We visited the Hindu Shiv Temple and had a quite different experience from what we expected. Firstly we dropped 108 silver coins on a snakelike walk through 108 bronze urns then we tied off our red thread to leave all our problems behind. We then started on a 'symbolic pilgrimage' through narrow tunnels that housed copies of holy shrines from other parts of India. We burned incense, threw a coin into the water ( wishing well) floated a candle and poured a milky substance over a stone. These all had significant meaning and we
Pouring milk over the holy stone at the Shiv Temple
were given a pamphlet about it as we left. The towering four armed elephant idol and huge Shiv idol were impressive though the polystyrene Himalayas background was a bit odd. From here we headed to the Bangalore Palace, which was built after the Tudor style and looked amazingly English from the outside. Inside we donned audio guides and started our tour, walking up the rosewood staircase, passing under the huge trophy elephants head shot by the present maharajah's father. There were fascinating insights into royal life and the palace held a real charm as well as architectural interest. The internal gardens and womens quarters were lovely. There were many photographs of grizzly hunts of magnificent tigers, elephants and other game animals. Underneath the photographs were grizzly elephant feet stools and one stool where the four legs were of some poor beast- a bit gruesome really. Apparently he saw the light in the early 1900s and now all these animals are protected.

Shopping was great and it was back to the lap of luxury!!!!

We got up to head to our final Indian destination- Bangalore. On the way we visited a summer palace. It was gorgeous, still original, fading and pitted in parts but still lovely. It was much smaller and housed a lot of history; finely worked aquatints from the 18 the century, a number of portraits of the ruling family by Thomas Hickey. These were very simple but expressive and sympathetic to the individuals. Weaponry, fresco paintings and explanations gave the history of the battles against the British. We arrived in Bangalore at our hotel. It was grotty!! That was it, we decided we would like a decent hotel before we left India so we talked to a local who recommended the Oberoi. We packed our bags back into the van ( much to the consternation of the hotel owner) and arrived at the Five star Oberoi-Bangalore. Oh luxury! It is divine. We spent the rest of the day here. The credit cards are getting loaded but we decided we needed a treat.

Chamundeshwari temple
15 Jan: Masinagudi to Mysore

Alarm went off at about 0600 for all in the room. This was probably a bit of a relief as the bed was hard and we were fully rested. We joined a guide, 2 others and Anne from the group on a bird watching tour. We walked around the 17 acre property and saw:

· Drangoes (or drongoes?)

· Shrikes

· A pair of malibar horn bills

· A crested eagle hawk

· 2 owlets

· Tracks of a mongoose

· Evidence of a slothbear breaking down a termite nest

· And elephant poo

We also saw painted cattle for the first time. Back to the retreat for a hearty breakfast. We settled our bills and the various tips and got back into the minibus headed toward Mysore. We followed the same rounds as we dead for the safari the previous bight, narrow with steep drop away edges. We passed through 3 national parks and spotted langurs, wild boar, macaques, spotted deer and unfortunately no elephants. The parks were quite clean and clearly actively managed. A buffer zone of at least 50m was created between
Worshipper
the road and the low vegetation around. We saw a family of langurs literally hanging around the tress, watching the passing parade of cars. One group of tourists were cycling through the park! The plains became more fertile as we approached Mysore. One the outskirts we drove up a mountain to see the Chamundeshwari temple right on the top. Dry landscape dotted with gum tress. Pilgrims dressed in black swarmed over the temple site. Catherine and I were each shooting off.

Down towards Mysore on the other side of the mountain we had a good overview of historical Mysore. We stopped to see a huge bull statue – the vehicle of Shiva. Young boys were dressed as characters from the great Hindu books. There was the monkey king, with a painted face and large lips. Local fruit stalls are plentiful, it’s a pity we cat enjoy them.

Towards the bottom of the hill we went past cattle that had been dyed yellow with turmeric, as part of a festival. These subsequently appear all over Mysore. Mysore seemed clean and quite regal, perhaps a university town. We drive past the palace and some upmarket department stores. We got to
Family group visiting the temple
our hotel at about 1530, so Catherine and I grabbed what we could for lunch. We ended up sharing a thick dip like puree of spinach and lentils, topped with melted cheese.

Elise told us, through facebook, that she was looking for an apartment in Udaipur for the girls to share. Anne (who teaches at a Steiner school), wanted to buy cheap saris for all 15 girls in her class. Catherine, Kathleen, Vicki, Roger and I joined her. It was at a government store, so the price was fixed. But none the less there were hundreds of options to sort through. 15 beautiful saris were purchased for the girls, as well as one for Anne to make a dress for her son’s wedding in Mexico next year. When we finished it was after dark. There was some difficulty in connecting with the other half of the group who had been to the markets. Several loops of Mysore CBD, and frantic phone calls before we connected again.

Well and truly dark by this time, so we were able to visit the palace which was lit up spectacularly as part of the festival. We wandered through and captured what we
Temple crowd
could using our fantastic Leica. The group then went to a beer garden restaurant with many tourists and a standard indian ensemble playing. I was struck the incredible diversity of western styles on show, with a couple of punks sitting just near us.

I was feeling a bit tentative about food, so I had a mushroom machali. I also tried another form of bread called kalcha, which was completely dry. I discussed with DJ the differences between chapartis, roti, naen and kalcha. This amount of curry and bread worked well. Catherine had a mocktail of mango, as well as her first butter chicken of the trip. The group was completely exhausted by 2130, so we headed home. DJ, our guide, told me about his experiences as a guide and how on occasion, tour companies black ban difficult clients.

16 Jan

I fronted for an ordinary breakfast of bread, jam and pawpaw. We were to visit a temple outside Mysore during the morning: Kesheva temple at Somnathapur. There was a local guide in our minibus by the time we all gathered.

The temple was about 50 minutes out of town through wonderfully lush farm land. We saw
Women purchasing flower offerings
rive, vegetables sugar cane. The cattle are decorated with different colours here, with streamers and glitter coming off their horns In the Mysore paper that morning, I saw photographs of cattle and people jumping through fire – all coloured with turmeric. This was all part of the festival. The temple itself had features like AngorWat. It was a monument to Vishnu. The guide was excellent telling us about the interpretations of the images and icons.

· Brahma

· Sawadee

· Vishnu

· Lakshmi

· Shiva

· Parvarti

The guide showed us some of the features that are mnemonic. Three showing faces of Brahma plus a beard, Havati has a book and an instrument, gods can have as many as 36 arms: mortals only 2. Some exquisite carvings of daily life and the great battles of the religious texts. Many of the small statues have been distributed around the world. Beautiful tress in the actively renovated garden. I particularly noticed the rain tree (Albizia).

We then went back to Mysore and directly to the palace. We embarked on a palace tour with a guide, who really put on a pantomime. There was a
Selling the offerings
spectacular hall for royal weddings. Paintings dating to the early 1900’s, where eyes seamed to follow you no matter where you stood. The palace was packed with Indians, around this festival day. Spectacular statues of jaguars guarded the palace. The whole thing was paid for by taxes from peasants and rajas. The tiles came from England, stained glass from Glasgow. After the tour I was able to return to the plaza area we had photographed the night before. Lunch was again at a small public eatery, where 35 RPS (about 75c), bought roti and several masalas. I got back to the hotel on the back of a small motor bike with the palace guide. Held on tight! I blogged in the room until we left for dinner at the house of a Muslim family near the station. A simple 3 room attached house. The table for 13 swapped it. The father was a friendly ‘Tevier’ type of character. Long suffering wife was definitely happy to have both daughters married and 3 grand children. One of the daughters had moved home: the custom is for the daughter to move from her husband’s family home back to her parents 3 months before
Children everywhere
the birth of a child and stays for 3 months after the birth. House had simple décor and heated floor – perhaps not intentional.

They served a lovely bhiriani of chicken and nuts. Wonderful for delicate stomachs, not too much ghee.Also an eggplant sambal and cucumber raita. Talk was free and our host was very engaging. Desert was golabjaman and custard. Entertainment was a copy of the wedding album. Bride and groom not smiling.High gloss paper.Only 450 guests. One grandchild ‘helped’ Andrea read through the book several times. The other daughter’s wedding had 4,500 guests as the husband was a ‘big’ business man. We then left for the station.
DJ told us that he is always stressed when getting onto night trains. Criminals target tourists who are dealing with all the chaos, and obviously tour groups get caught up in it. We gathered just beside our tour bus and covered each other’s backs. The train we were after was on the first platform and the carriage not too far away. Of course the carriages were dirty and not very inviting. Nonetheless the insides are clear enough. We were sharing our compartment with four of the other travellers. We got
In the temple grounds
Catherine onto the top bunk and she immediately went to sleep. Gradually the other five found their respective bunks. Big backpacks were secured under the bottom bunk and there was not much extra space. The train started on time and lights-out was at about 2230.

Bella the Brave
India is filled with stray dogs. I was prepared for that. But then I met Bella.

Bella was lying by the main road in our village, helpless and sick. He was severely malnourished, barely able to walk, and totally unloved. You could see his ribs ripple under his skin every time he breathed.

And nobody seemed to care. Everyone here would walk straight over him.

I have been trying to feed him milk and soft biscuits this past week, but he remained extremely weak and unresponsive. He made my heart break.

So last night I got in contact with Rakesh, the founder of Voice of Stray Dogs (http://www.strays.in/). Check out their website! They are a not-for-profit organisation that rescues and gives medical treatment to stray dogs, and helps rehabilitate them. They have animal ambulances, and qualified vets on staff. Rakesh confirmed that they could treat Bella. I now had a plan...

This morning I found Bella, lying by the road as usual (see the photo), and carefully lifted him into a box with a towel as a bed. I was so worried I would hurt him, he was so fragile.

Tracey and I then caught
Where I picked Bella up
a bus and a rickshaw into Bangalore city, where the Voice of Stray Dogs has its office and shelter.

Rakesh, the founder came to meet me and Bella, and assured me that they would look after him! The vet said that Bella had a fever and an extremely low blood count, but they could help him!!!

I must admit I cried. I know that I cannot fix India's problems in a month, or even a village's problems. But you know what? I could solve this poor dogs problems. And thanks to Voice of Stray Dogs, I believe I did.

If you would like to follow Bella's progress, pop onto their website, and type in my email: sheree.venter@outlook.com

Also, if anyone is wondering, I named him Bella, because it means beautiful. When you look through the fleas and emancipation, you can see how beautiful he is.

One of our catch-phrases here is ""TII"" to stand for ""This is India.""

We just had a TII moment...

We were in Bangalore city for the weekend, and had to head home this evening. We found a lovely auto-rickshaw driver who would give us the meter fare, and was even willing to drive us ALL the way home! Usually this trip requires you to change rickshaw's twice, to put this into perspective. He was even willing to wait for us to finish dinner before driving us the final leg home. Top Bloke.

Except....there was one small problem...

His headlight was broken.

Like kaput. Out. Gone.

Oops.

Rural India. Rough roads. Speed bumps. Darkness.

Thankfully I had my teeny tiny torch on me (It's smaller than my pinky and puts out about 10 lumes). So for most of the trip home, I was half hanging out of the rickshaw, pointing this tiny flashlight at the road!

Only in India!

Playing Chinese Whispers
I am loving my time at the 40K plus pod here in Maralakunte. As many of you know, I have had trouble interacting with children in the past. I am loving it here though. The kids are lovely, enthusiastic and well behaved.

Pod time consists of the welcome song, and 2 sessions of 15 minutes on the tablets. These are broken up with ""Brain Breaks"" where we play games, such as Bullrush, Stuck in the Mud, Bang and Simon Says. Finally there is a 15 minute session of spoken English, where we generally break up into smaller groups to help the kids with conversational English.

40K is in the process of upgrading its curriculum and delivery method, changing it into a fully interactive app, which is very exciting!

Once again, please consider donating to 40K, to help these pods keep running until a totally financially sustainable business model can be implemented. The new interactive app is going to be amazing, but it is also a huge capital expenditure. Even five bucks makes a difference here!

Also, feel free to comment on these posts. I'd love to hear your thoughts and impressions. Any requests for a blog about
Tablet time
a particular aspect of life here is also welcome!

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi
January 10th 2014
Published: January 10th 2014


Vitthal Temple
Hampi, is a very beautiful place which I had been waiting to explore since quite sometime now which finally we (me and my husband) managed to plan it in December 2013 from 21st to 25th.

To start with what hampi is all about, Hampi is the former capital of Vijaynagar Empire where you can see beautiful Virupaksja temple, Vitthala temple, Lakshmi Narasimha and many more. The ruins of Hampi are a UNESCO world heritage site. Along with the beautiful Hampi ruins, you will find boulders all around which makes climbing on them an amazing experience.

We started off from Pune via VRL bus on 20th Dec. around 10:30PM and reached Hospet at 8:30 AM. It takes abt 9 hours to reach Hospet. Hampi is abt 30 minutes from Hospet... You can reach Hampi from Hospet via the state run buses or you can drive in a rickshaw. We being tired, hired a rick which charged us around 180Rs to drop us till Virupaksha temple.

We stayed on the other side of the river and abt 4 KMs after crossing the river. I had booked Gowri resort and was a perfect decision as the rooms were really clean and
Vitthal Temple
basic, had a nice swing on the front where I could sit hours together just gazing at the skies and the boulders.. They also had rice fields which added to the beauty... Also very close is Sanapur lake which is unexplored by tourists as its far from the main river but its really too beautiful.. The food was good too so we didnt bother to go out to eat ever.

You will also see a lot of foreigners staying on the other side of the river, mainly as Hampi is a holy place, you will not get non-veg food and Alcohol which is both available on the other side of the river.

We hired a bike for all the 4 days and thoroughly enjoyed our stay... Hiring a bike gave us the flexibility of reaching a place at our pace and not being bothered.. Bike is charged abt 200Rs per day and 100 Rs/liter petrol. We visited it at the right time so the temperature wasn't too high though by the end of the trip, i was all tanned. (which I still am recovering from ) Hampi is pretty hot during the day so ensure that you use
Pushkarini
sunblock all the time...

The highlight of the trip was Vitthala temple, Virupaksha temple, Ganesh temple, Matanga hills, Krishna temple and Monkey hill.. You shall visit Matanga hills if you stay in Virupaksha side of the temple and visit Monkey hill if on the other side of the river, for sunset.. You get a beautiful view of the entire Hampi from both the hills... we truly enjoyed seeing the view and wish could be on the hills every evening to see the sunset..

We had hired a guide for few hours to show us around Vitthala temple , Virupaksha temple, Matanga hills, Achutraya temple and all the important other ruins. It was nice to know the history behind these places. We went to Lakshmi Narsimha , Krishna temple, Shivlinga all by ourselves as it was all walking distance. Also we ensured that we travelled on bicycles one day (cycles are one of the ways to explore around Hampi) after we had seen all the important ruins and just be all by ourselves... we thoroughly enjoyed our bicycling experience... Coconut water helped us refresh ourselves whenever we were tired with cycling.

This has been one of the best
trips till date.. Do try to visit this place when in India and I am sure you will be happy you visited Hampi...

My Sari
We have arrived in Maralakunte, where we will be staying for the next month!

India

I have seen a massive juxtaposition between the wealthy and the poor here. We have walked through a village past a dog dying of starvation (I wanted to cry), and soon after passed a house with solar heating on the roof and a car out the front. In the city you occasionally pass the luxury car in your auto-rickshaw, for which you are paying 20cents per 1km!

Maralakunte

The village is larger than I expected, and has a brand new temple, which only opened recently. This means that they have celebrations every night for the following month, with blaring prayer music, gong-banging and incense burning! Lots of fun, unless you want to go to bed early, what with the temple across the road from our apartment!

PLUS +Pod

Today we attended our first +Pod session. The kids were amazingly keen, and excited!

The program runs for one hour, were the kids work in groups of three for 15 minutes at a time on a tablet, with ""Brain Breaks"" in the middle. We played Simon says in these
My Sari
And yes, I folded it/ put it on myself!
breaks- they seem to know their body parts!!

Impact project

As part of my stay here with 40K, we are working to set up a new Pod in a village called Chikajala about 15km from where we are staying.

We approached the local government school today, and had a mixed reaction. The English teacher seemed very keen on the idea of 40K Plus Pod, but apprehensive about the admission fee. We believe however that parents with recognise the value of the program focusing on improving their kid's English foundation.

It is so important to get these pods being financially sustainable and accessible to the poorest families, but achieving these dual aims is still hard. At the moment fundraising is making up the difference. Please think about donating to help us work towards a sustainable model. At the moment, the 200 kids in the program would not be here without your support! Visit http://makingadifference.gofundraise.com.au/page/VenterS to donate!

Tomorrow we will go back and talk to the other government school and another English teacher who is interested in facilitating the Pod classes.

I'll keep you updated!

After 18 hours on a plane, a stopover in Frankfurt and much fitful non-sleeping, I have arrived in India!

We landed at the ungodly hour of 2:30am, so truth be told, I'm a little bit like a walking zombie today!

I have made my first foray into the city to purchase some much needed coffee (a surprisingly acceptable latte) and Indian styled clothing.

I now have a beautiful sari (whose blouse is being tailored today, so I can't show you it just yet) and a traditional ""salwar kameez"" (the long tunic, trousers and scarf). I somehow feel like I paid more than I should have for these... but what the hell, being ripped off once or twice is part of the fun isn't it?

I'll check in soon, when I have some pics to post.

Also- please leave comments on these posts (even if it's just your name) since I'd love to know who is actually reading these! Cheers

30th December

Our last breakfast together as Pete and Jane were going home today. No radio active marmalade for a change, the colour of it has generally been bright to say the least. Very sad to say goodbye to them as they have been great travelling companions and also say goodbye to Bala, he had been great to have as our driver.... Sal got emotional again with all the goodbyes and as we were all hugging and saying goodbye a tuk tuk driver came and joined in! Sal and Col had a bit of time so took a short ride in a tuk tuk just because we like a ride in them and the driver was lovely, his name was Babu. He took us to see a huge tree, he said it was a rain tree that had been decorated for Christmas and found 2 kids playing cricket and Col had been longing for a game all holiday, at last he had his chance, the kids thought he was mad! Sal had a chat with their grandad who was so pleased we were British and said how the place wasn't the same since the British left India and rubbish/litter was
image
his main gripe. Next to where they were playing cricket on a rough bit of ground was the tuk tuk driver training and exam area, that figured! The tuk tuk driver spoke great English, between him and the man in the laundry we understood more than we did from the guide! The tuk tuk driver called his vehicle his open air 3 wheeled Ferrari!

As Jane and Pete headed to the airport, Col and Sal met their new driver David and smaller vehicle. We were heading north to a small village near to Palakkad. Apart from Bala we have decided all Indian drivers are mad and David was no exception, once out of the city, the road was one lane each way and not in great condition but they drove the same.... For instance, the car In front of us was overtaking a truck and we overtook both but at the same time the same was going on on the other side of the road so a 2 lane road had 6 cars abreast, we clenched our buttocks and closed our eyes! You have to give credit to the Motorcyclists and tuk tuk drivers who get pushed out of
image
the way and really have to have their wits about them constantly. Not that we would consider doing a self drive holiday here but if we did, Col's vehicle of choice would be a steam roller!

We stayed in a home stay again, an old family home that had been in the family for 5 generations. It was a beautiful old house with lots of dark rich wood and seemed to be built around what would have been 2 small bathing pools. Shoes left at doorstep. Our host had a long name, he said to call him Bugs and he had a dog called Dodger who was a pug and real character, he actually had 2 more dogs in kennels in the garden and 3 puppies of Dodgers too. We ate with Bugs in the evening, he had a woman housekeeper who cooked and served the most delicious food, it really was very good. He was slightly odd being mine host as he had dinner and breakfast with us as he said he did with all guests but never asked us anything, we did our best to keep a conversation going asking him various questions but he asked us
image
nothing, seemed odd. We went for a walk in the local village and were warmly welcomed by everyone we saw, but we were doing battle with Mosquitos which carried on for our entire stay, so inside seemed a better bet.

31st December

After breakfast in the garden, we set off for Coonoor which is a 4 hour journey mostly vertical. We have no idea how high up we drove but we passed some clouds. The journey wasn't the most comfortable as it was hairpin bend after hairpin bend and lots of overtaking going on, there are numerous signs saying dangerous bends, no overtaking......... Nobody read them. A couple of times we would have to stop as they had got in a tangle ahead of us and someone had to get out of a vehicle to make others move back to allow the traffic to move. Bus drivers are mad men +++, they go tearing along and take the downward bends on the wrong side of the road aaaggghhh! Our hotel is another homestay and we are in the deluxe suite, it makes us laugh how they like to big things up with names, it was hardly deluxe but
image
has lots of room and everything we need. David took us down to the town for an hour, it was pretty manic so an hour was probably enough. The market was lively as they all are, fruit, veg, flower garlands, clothes, shoes, bags and everything else you might ever need. Full of people and noise but fairly clean which was good to see. Our driver like most of them sleeps in the car which we feel quite uncomfortable about and can't imagine he gets that much sleep when he has so much driving to do, anyway we bought him some chocolate and nuts as a New Years Eve present.

Our hotel was offering a 'gala' dinner for New Years Eve, there was about 20 people and it was out in the garden. They had a roaring fire going as it was very cold being so high up and they did well, a good selection of food and a great guy making the breads, he would have given a pizza maker a run for his money with his style, we have to admit to sliding away at 11pm and tucked up in bed to see the New Year in plus
image
the hotel was dry so waiting another hour in the cold to raise a glass of water .... Hmmmmm. Our driver was parked up just a few feet away and he wouldn't have been offered anything by the hotel and no doubt there was loads left over...... Strange old world, which we didn't feel comfortable about at all.

1st January

Service at breakfast was non existent, after 3 requests and half an hour plus wait, we got some coffee, we gave up on the eggs! David drove us down to the railway station where we were going to catch the toy train to Ooty. It is a regular passenger service but travels through beautiful countryside so is popular with tourists. There were lots of signs on the station which made us laugh, the retiring room, 1st class waiting room though the upper class waiting room was locked (what's the difference between upper and 1st class!) on one station there was a dormitory room.

It was a lovely journey, a large Indian family were in the same carriage as us and they made very pleasant company to talk to, their older son age 13 had quite good English
image
and was keen to practice and their younger son had climbed up into the luggage rack and gone to sleep. David was there to meet us and start the descent, it was a longer but a much prettier route than the previous day and far less cars though we turned one corner to find a car on its roof though everyone seemed to have got out ok. We travelled through a wildlife park where there are suppose to be tigers but no luck this time and though we didn't see any, David said you could often see elephants here, we did see lots of deer.

We arrived in Mysore, another busy, vibrant, noisy town, cows and dogs everywhere, we went to Mysore Palace which was pretty spectacular though the Maharajah has just died, and it was a public holiday so overloaded with people, all having to remove shoes so there were piles of them, everywhere, we chose the free shoe storage desk which we thought gave us a better chance of finding them again, however, it might have been free but had the attendant demanding a tip to give us back our shoes!

Our hotel was very nice
image
with a lovely colonial feel. Big news, we were going shopping! Not much of that on this holiday! Sal had spotted a place earlier and had to try and get David back there! David was disappointed that Europeans don't barter, so, he came with us and after we had looked at the obligatory tourist shop went to a local place and he stood back whilst Col bartered and he was dead impressed! High fives! Later Sal had a hawker selling ankle bells which was not on the shopping list but it's all a game, he wanted 1200 rupees we got him down to 100 for 2 and we are sure he still made a profit! Anybody want any ankle bells?!

David was very keen to get us back to the palace for the sound and light show and we weren't disappointed, we really enjoyed it, followed by a great meal at our hotel.

2nd January

Very strange at breakfast this morning, having struggled to get a seat for dinner last night, there was nobody there, it was 8am which has been busy at every other hotel.

David had suggested a visit to Keshava Temple which way
image
just north of Mysore on our way to Bangalore, we are so glad he did as it was a stunning 13th century temple, the architecture was beautiful and the detailed carving was stunning, from here we went to Dariya Daulat Bagh, the summer palace of Tipu Sultan.... He was ringing bells from the V & A. This was 18th century and was intricately painted inside with flowers and peacocks plus some murals as well, in its day it would have been an amazing place but much has got damaged and weathered but they have started to restore so would be fabulous to see in a few years time.

The journey to Bangalore was through lots of very fertile countryside, loads of paddy fields, carrots, jasmine, cauliflower, sugar cane, banana and David had now got the hang of us that we wanted to stop and photograph everything that seemed everyday and normal to him and the opposite to us. We went into the paddy fields where they were cutting it and another where they were collecting it, shame on us we didn't even know what rice looked like when it was growing. We had 2 varieties of banana, quite different
image
in texture and taste, we didn't always get the best photos but it is amazing how friendly people are and willing to let you, in fact pleased to let you photograph them working. We saw loads of oxen pulling carts loaded up, must be hard work but the animals have very gentle eyes. There were herds of goats and sheep and we saw lots of donkeys as well, some of them just roaming. We loved it. We never cease to be amazed at the ladies deportment, carrying huge bundle of sticks or big pots of water on their head. Calfs and goats laying across the passenger's lap on motor bikes, too much to see!

We got to Bangalore, unfortunately on the outskirts an accident had not long happened and the person was dead, the drivers all slowed to have a look and then Immediately restarted whacky races, the person had been killed by a bus and the newspaper also said that a bus had crashed the previous day killing all on board.........

Bangalore was a traffic jam, this was David's home town, he said there was 100,000 tuk tuks on the road here and we didn't disbelieve him.
image
We saw a truck loaded up with motor bikes which were being taken away for illegal parking, can't say we had ever noticed 'parking' everyone seemed to leave their vehicle where they felt like it! This particular truck had a man running after it waving a fistful of rupees!

We went to the parliament building and palace and then a bit of time to walk around the old market area, we love this, get in amongst it! Shopping is a big deal in India and here the smart shops mixed with the more traditional shops, we added a bit more to the Indian economy of course.

Unfortunately the next stop was the airport to start the journey home, as always a lovely chap was at the airport from Indian Panorama to assist us. Nearly every stop we have been met by somebody from Indian Panorama to assist with anything we may need though everything has been so well organised we have never needed help, we can't praise them enough.

We had a flight (with piped music of the Christmas variety all the way!) to Mumbai with an overnight stop in the first hotel we stayed in more
image
than a month ago, before onwards to London the following day.

What a fabulous trip we have had, Jane and Pete were great travelling companions. Every day has brought a new experience, new sights, sounds and smells. India is an amazing place, sometimes it is a amazingly wonderful and sometimes amazingly sad and awful but never anything less than fascinating.

I will miss being called Shally or ma'am, we will miss the incredibly welcoming people and the lovely weather, the fantastic food and the fact that Delhi Belly didn't pay us a visit is a big plus. I am sorry I didn't get an opportunity to weave Sheila Dikshit into the blog, she is an Indian politician we read about and that name deserves a mention! What a fabulous holiday but we are looking forward to a cup of tea and our own bed.

November 30th 2013
Published: November 30th 2013


Gokarna
The view
So there I was heartbroken and just shy of my birthday. The question was where do I arrive and depart from here?

Forty-five minutes later I was rooting for the auto driver as he dodged traffic to get to the bus stand and then before I took stock of things I was on the bus en route to Gokarna with S.

It is funny how our weakest moment can set us free to live more bravely and truthfully. I hope Gokarna will take my mind off things but I take my mind along. A rookie mistake.

I don’t remember much of the bus journey except for the amourous exchanges between the couple in the berth across mine.

Day 1

We get off the bus in Gokarna. We trudge along lost and all we know is we have to head to Gokarna International. One look at it and then at each other’s faces, we are back on the street. An auto driver agrees to take us to Om Beach, named so as the beach seems to spell out Om the way it is written in Sanskrit. Soon we are on the hills zigzagging; these are the Ghats.
Gokarna
Play


Higher and higher and I get my first glimpse of the sea. It is green and brown and green and then there’s shimmering blue gazing up at me. That turn where I first catch sight of it – I forget everything and know I did the right thing coming here to this town named after the cows that are everywhere.

We arrive at the Namaste Café and get a cottage. We sit in the café for a while sea gazing. There are guests sunning themselves or smoking on the porches. But otherwise, it is quiet and deserted. We slather on Nutella on the toast. That was mostly what we ate during our stay.

The town is sweltering. But the shops beckon. There are adorable bandannas, dresses, stoles, harem pants and other hippie-ish clothes that soon help us blend in with the crowd. A young boy sells books in many languages, left behind by tourists and he speaks many languages too – Italian, French, Russian…and they are more than a smattering. Yet another invites us into his shop filled with drums, xylophones and more. He shows us how to hold the African drum pressed between our thighs and
Gokarna
Sunset and fairy orbs
how to slap its goat-skin surface with our palms to build a rhythm. He plays and plays until sweat drips down his hair and he is completely lost in the beats.

At a juice shop, we take a break to cool off. The heat is unbearable. A woman, a blonde and older version of Zeenat Aman crooning Dum Maro Dum, sits across the table. A big tikka on her forehead, huge sunglasses, a saffron kurta. She is met by a bald and tattoo-ed man and he asks us where we are from. She is heading to Bangalore, taking a train from there. He says we Indian women are beautiful and the woman swats his arm and laughs. I want to ask them where they are from, where is the train taking them to next, what did Gokarna bring to them…but I don’t.

We stop for a beer at a shack on Kudle beach and the decision is unanimous. We are trading Om Beach for Kudle. We also find the other Gokarna International. We trudge up a hill, the bendy soft grasses brushing our legs and at High Point the views stops us.

Day 2

The next morning, we pack our bags and make our move to Kudle. The descent is steep. We exchange hellos with other tourists. It is friendly and non-intrusive. It feels like we are looking at them and with our hellos we are really agreeing ‘isn’t this wonderful? Aren’t we glad to be here?’ These steep climbs turn into mini waterfalls during the monsoons we are told. The shacks are closed down, not the best time to visit Gokarna. But it is November and just the right time to be here and the clouds have long since cleared.

A man is practicing meditation. Barefoot, he is paying attention to every step he takes, feeling his feet press down into the stones and red earth. We don’t exist as he communes with the earth and his soul.

Day 3

We wake up to the sea. A few boats are bobbing on the waves. There are mostly families with children early in the morning. Children with pails playing in the pools between rocks the sea forgot to take back. The rocks have black crabs crawling on them. A woman in a neon bikini claims the rocks have changed positions, the sea goddess has moved them, she says.

Shells peek out of the sand, some broken and some whole. There are ridges drawn by the sea waves by swirling and pulling at the sand. We trace a circle around a dead starfish, the circle of life. There are sand mounds, castles decked with shells. A bunch of red flowers float by. A pentacle is enclosed in a circle. 369 it says.

Later an older crowd starts coming out. Some spread out the blankets and lay down to tan. Others occasionally run into the water to cool off. A couple exchanges a long kiss, the waves dancing around them. A man with dreadlocks collects shells to put in his hair. At night, it is pitch black and one can’t take a step forward without a long range torch. Only the shacks are alive.

We sit at the shack. More nutella and toast, interrupted by falafel and hummus (lots of Israelis around) and bonafie pie. And Somerset Maugham’s Of Human Bondage while not gazing at the sea.

The Grand Finale

As evening nears, crowds of people sit out on the beach. Cows wander in. There are men selling beaded necklaces. Frisbees in the air. A woman with tassled sticks does her thing. Some just lie back with a book. Slowly, as if by an unspoken agreement, the sea is clear of swimmers and everyone is out on the beach. The cows disappear. The chatter dies down. The clamor of a dog is brought to a halt as an old bearded man with chillum, roars out ‘Shanka!’ We watch the show. Now, there is only the sound of the sea.

A lone lithe woman with wispy blonde hair looks like a sylph thrown out of water. The evening was so heavy with magic, I would not have been surprised if her legs, as they teased the waves with light kicks, had turned into a shimmery green mermaid’s tail and the wave had whisked her away. She seemed to be doing a tango with the sea, taking a step forward as the wave receded and stepping back as it approached. Her boyfriend walked in, a wooden staff in hand, twirling it deftly.

Watching the long drawn out sunset with no promise of an encore, the sky splashed in neon pink, orange like a dragon’s breath and purple, the sun – a great orange ball – sliding down into the sea, I was restored and I made peace with the world. And then all was dark.

Sri Chamundeswari temple
Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

Mysore is a bustling city which main tourist attraction is the Maharaja's Palace. Tom really wanting to see it so I waiting for him to arrive to go inside. Tom was due to arrive on Sunday but missed his flight in London so didn't make it to Mysore until Monday. So I went around the place on my own for a day. I even tried street food and survived.

Chamundi Hill: to get there I took the bus 201 from City bus station. It is about half an hour away, up a hill. The place was crowded with Indian tourist. I did not bother to queue to see inside the temple or to get a free darshan (the lines were too long). So I just stayed around the temple, watching people doing some rituals before going in. It was interesting even if I have no idea what was going on.

Rail museum: I went there because the Lonely Planet wrote 'this one is a real gem' and 'half a day of fun'. Well I don't know if they have ever been there or not but this was a big disappointment. There is not much to see and I went around in
ritual
half hour. If I were them I would rather write something along those lines 'if you have some time to kill while waiting for your train in Mysore, you can have a quick look at the rail museum (it's only 10 rupies)'.

Maharaja's Palace: the Palace is illuminated on week-end days from 7 to 8pm. It looks very impressive, and they even have a marching band. The Palace is rather recent. The building was finished in 1912, 15 years after the previous one burned down. Learning form experience they built the new palace in stones and not in wood. When you are a foreigner you pay your entrance fee about ten times higher than Indians (it seems to be the same all over India). However you get an audio guide ‘for free' and this was very much appreciated. It's full of interesting facts and not too long.

Devaraja market: very lively bazaar. Highly recommended. It's full of colours, with the paints, the flowers... We were shown how to make incenses and drawn on our hands. I really enjoyed walking around, overwhelmed by the colours and scents.

Mysore est une ville grouillante dont la principale attraction touristique est le Palace des Maharajas. Tom voulait
impassive cows
le visiter donc j'ai attendu son arrivée avant d'y rentrer. Il était censé arrivér Dimanche mais comme il a raté son avion à Londres il n'est arrivé que Lundi. J'ai donc visité la ville toute seule pendant une journée. J'ai même été assez courageuse pour manger dans la rue et je n'ai même pas été malade. Mon estomac tient bien le coup.

Chamundi Hill : pour m'y rendre, j'ai pris le bus 201. Depuis la station de bus prés du palais on est en haut de la montagne en une petite demi-heure. Une fois là haut, je me suis retrouvée au milieu d'une foule de touristes indiens. La file d'attente pour rentrer dans le temple était très longue et ne semblait pas bouger bien vite. Du coup, je me suis juste baladée autour du temple en regardant les gens faire les rituels avant d'y rentrer. Je n'y comprends rien mais c'est intéressant.

Musée du rail : j'y suis allée parce que la Lonely Planet a écrit ‘une perle' et ‘une demi-journée de fun assuré'. Je ne sais pas si je suis allée au mauvais endroit ou si eux n'y sont jamais allés mais j'en ai fait le tour en une
women hairdo
demi-heure et ce n'était vraiment pas intéressant. Si je devais écrire un commentaire je dirais ‘si vous avez une longue attente en gare de Mysore, vous pouvez aller faire un tour au musée du rail, c'est seulement 10 roupies l'entrée'.

Palais des Maharaja : le palais est illuminé les soirs du week end de 19h à 20h. Ça rend vraiment bien et ils ont même une fanfare qui fait le spectacle. C'est un palais récent, sa construction s'est achevée en 1912. C'est à dire 15 ans après que le précédent ait brulé. Du coup, celui-ci est en pierre et non en bois. En tant qu'étranger, on paye la visite 10 fois plus cher mais on a droit à un audio guide. On a bien fait de le prendre car il est bien fait et rend la visite bien plus intéressante.

Le marché Devaraja : c'est le souk. Les couleurs; les bruits et les odeurs se mélangent dans ce lieux fermé et entassé. On a pu voir comment fabriquer des encens. On s'est baladé au milieu de sacs de fleurs et de tas de poudres colorées. On nous a même fait un dessin sur la main. On s'est régalé.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Coorg Travel-log (21/10/13 to 24/10/13)<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;""> by Aravind

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Prelude

It’s after more than 12 years that I am at writing a travel-log again. Not that, in 12 years we haven’t travelled, but for one reason or other, it simply didn’t happen. I dedicate this to the dearest family!

When I make a comparison between ‘the then’ and ‘now’, I realise that slowly I have distanced myself from making detailed planning and preparation for the trip. As for everything else, this approach has its positives and negatives. Many of them revealed themselves during the trip. We hope to learn from these experiences and get better for next trip, which of course will be next year. We have forced ourselves to be in the business of travelling each year by becoming member of Club Mahindra for 10 years. So, here we go with our first trip to ‘Coorg’, courtesy Club Mahindra Coorg Valley!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Day 1 – 21/10/13 – The journey and introduction to Mahindra Resorts

Before starting from Puttur, I checked about the distance, time and condition of road to Coorg with some experts. Distance is about 80 to 90 KMs, none was sure about the road condition and time it would take is about 3 hrs. I wasn’t convinced with the ‘time’ as it seemed 30 KM/hr is too slow for any condition of road. Trusting the words of the experts, we started at 11 AM as check-in @ resort would be at 2 PM. I was almost sure that we will complete lunch on the way. My conviction got further strengthened as we could maintain an average speed of 60+ for first half an hour or so (close to Sullya). Then came the most dreaded part of this journey, as there was any road for next 30 KMs (upto Sampaje), forget about the condition of the road. It took almost 90 mins to cover this 30 KM distance. ‘TATA’ jindabad, our Indigo XL survived! As we entered Coorg and the ghat section, the road was amazingly, in excellent condition. Yet another realisation about different ways in which ‘unity in diversity’ is demonstrated in our great country, India!

Our plans of having lunch before checking-in, had gone for a toss. With butterflies in our stomach, we went through the rituals of check-in. By the time we were on lunch table, it was 3:15 PM, and restaurant was about to close in 15 mins. We rushed through the orders and lunch. At the end, I am not sure if had enough to fill our stomach, but certainly bill was fat. We realised we need to be ‘kanjoos’ when it comes to availing services within the resort, and we indeed did so! The microwave owen and fridge in the room helped us in the process.

Rest of the evening was spent in park (children’s play area), and fun zone. Anagha did painting and Amogh had a bike ride before ‘evening activity’ of that day.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Evening activity

Each evening the ‘holiday activity’ department organises entertainment programs. This evening was ‘magic show’ and ‘dj’. It was refreshing to see a magic show, and we thoroughly enjoyed it along with Anagha. For some reason, it didn’t seem to invoke any curiosity in Amogh. However the last part, removing Salman Khan’s top, and Aishwarya’s hair (from their photos) had both kids rolling in laughter. Anagha, Amogh and I (though I am ‘pappu’ when it comes to dance) danced to the DJ and Grishma watched us. The experience had us looking forward to the activity in coming evenings.

Being very cautious of the charges, we booked ‘jeep safari’ for next morning and ended our day with dinner in the room. The leftovers were stored in refrigerator. We had fairly good idea about what to do next day i.e. a ‘jeep safari’ in the morning, ‘swimming pool’ in the after-noon, and ‘fun activities’ in the evening.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Day 2 – 22/10/13 – Beginning of adventure

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">‘Jeep safari’ was to start @ 9:30 AM, and we managed to reach on time. We started fairly on time compared to usual stretches that happen with IST (Indian Stretchable Time). Ours was the first jeep among the 2 and we had a couple accompanying us. Naturally we occupied the 2 back seats (parallel to road). This seating was first time for Anagha and Amogh, they seemed to be excited about it. Our jeep was leading the way through the rocky mountain roads (if they can be called roads), and we suddenly found ourselves on the tip of a mountain. We were to drive them from that tip at an angle more than 45 degrees, and so we did with ‘woos’ and ‘aaas’. The real risks involved in this ride were visible only when we got down from our jeep and saw the second jeep take the same path. There came Grishma ‘If I knew that this is what we were up to, I wouldn’t have taken this ride’. Then we trekked around on the mountains. We went to a place where last scene of supposed to be hit Kannada movie ‘Galipata’ was shot. I haven’t been really watching or following Kannada movies, but even Grishma hasn’t been doing it for long, so we couldn’t really relate. Grishma seemed unusually energised by the surroundings and did all trekking (though with some grumping). It was difficult to believe that she was almost stuck to bed for 50+ hrs 3 days ago.

On the way back, we got down near a bridge where river Kaveri flowed across and played in the water. We were back at the resort at about 1:30 PM as 1 piece each after the first adventure.

Kids had the urge to immediately get into the swimming pool after lunch, but I had exercised veto and we had a nap. We went to the swimming pool at about 4 PM and there was little drizzle and water was freezing cold. Our urge, determination and ‘paisa vasool’ mentality got better of us. We spent about an hour in the pool. After lot of force, Anagha swam in the 4 FT pool and I tried my ‘once in a year’ kind of swimming attempt. Amogh was in the kid’s pool, and Grishma was enjoying our ‘suffertainment’ (a combination of suffering and entertainment).

Due to the rain, the evening activity was limited to ‘indoors’ and there was a ‘visual quiz’. Residents of the resort were split into 2 teams and mostly ‘bollywood’ based quiz was conducted. From each team volunteers were called up to answer questions. Our team won, thanks to our contribution of ‘not attempting to answer the questions’, surely we would have lost as we hardly knew any answer.

We planned the next day after dinner. We had to leave our kids in the room to go to the ‘wi fi’ zone. Our plan was to go to ‘Buddhist monastery’ in Kushal Nagar early morning, then to ‘Dhubare elephant safari’, and some other places nearby. Curtains, day 2!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Day 3 – 23/10/13 – On our own

After paying Rs 1800/- for ‘jeep safari’, we had decided to go around <strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">on our own on day 3 & 4. Even though our plan was to start at 7 AM, we started at around 8 AM. Experience had forced us to have breakfast outside the resort, and so we did. Not that the experience was great outside (except for economy). When we inquired about cold idli, wada and sambhar, the prompt reply was that it’s common in hilly areas, by the time the eatables reach the table, it becomes cold (I remembered Rajnikanth).

Finally we bought Duracell batteries for our camera on the way to ‘Buddhist monastery’. Even these batteries run out quite fast and we had to change them often (date gets reset every such time and photos show 1/1/2002). We reached monastery at 9:30 and were there till 11 AM. It’s a peaceful place where one will be absorbed into spirituality. The writings were inspiring especially because I consider myself spiritually inclined. It was more than worth the travel!

We reached our next destination ‘dhubare elephant safari’ @ 11:30 AM. For the first time in our life we had ‘jolly ride’ on the elephant and also a ‘horse ride’. While height was only risk factor in the elephant ride, horse ride had combination of height and speed. My overconfidence took a beating when the horse took off. I was left at the mercy of the horse and so was the horse. I enjoyed this ride though! The kids too enjoyed the rides. The boat ride and little play in the water were icing on the cake. There was white water rafting as well, but we have postponed it for future (possibly somewhere else).

I had ‘Rajiv Gandhi National park (a.k.a. Nagarahole)’ in the mind all the while. As we hadn’t planned anything in particular, we inquired about Nagarahole. We got mixed feedback on safari, some said it’s ON, and for some others it wasn’t. However people referred to nearby ‘Irupu falls’. It was about 60 KMs, and we decided to GO FOR IT, after having a quick lunch.

The drive was scenic and quite long among the hills of Coorg. Roads however weren’t in great condition though better than between Sullya and Sampaje. Impact of the lunch was visible on the kids as they went to sound sleep on the back seat. Grishma had several doubts, ‘is it worth? Will it be safe (naxalite area)? When do we come back? Etc’. I kept on giving some or the other answer which obviously weren’t convincing to her (as always). We passed through Ponnampet and Gonikoppal which evoked some childhood memories of Grishma. We reached an isolated and crowd-starved ‘Irupu falls’ @ 2:30 PM. To know that it’s 0.75 KM walk (trek) to the falls one-way, only increased existing doubts (on its worth) multi-fold. ‘Let’s have look at the falls anyway’ we thought (paisa tho vasool karna padega).

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">The scary trek: As we started on, several signboards appeared about ‘wild animals’, ‘poisonous snakes’, ‘tigers’ etc., but there was no sign of any other human soul. Anagha and Amogh quickly found some security by holding my hands tightly, and brave Grishma was left alone behind. The memories of cheetahs attacking Tirupathi pilgrims only made matters worse. Soon all the mentioned animals (and much more) were running around in our stomach. Somehow, we reached the falls, and it was ‘AWESOME’. I remembered quote ‘there is no short cut to any place worth going’. How true literally it was, and I wished it applied to all our lives on a daily basis. Why are we always in a hurry?

There were few people near the falls and it seemed they were spending their day there. We stuck around for 30 mins or so. The return trek was easier than the forward as we were walking down the known path, experience teaches, and indeed counts! Just when we were near the exit, Anagha <strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">screamed loud!!! She mistook ‘<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Aumbbhhaaaa’ of a cow for roar of a tiger J

At about 3:30, we started to ‘Nagarahole’ from there which was only about 8 KMs or so. As anticipated there was no safari, but we decided to pass through the forest to Hoonsoor and back to Madikeri. We could spot lot of deers, few peacocks, and a lot of signboards warning us about wild animals. When Anagha asked about ‘what’s a safari?’, Our answer was that ‘it is opposite of the zoo’. The logic being ‘In zoo, animals are inside a cage and we enjoy looking at them, and in safari, we are inside cage (car etc.) and they enjoy looking at us’!

It wasn’t spectacular, but ok for an evening long drive through a thick forest. Now we had to rush back to the resort before the start of evening activity. We reached just at the right time.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">The family games: The participating residents were divided into 2 teams and made to play/involve in different games/activities. One such activity was picking a pair kids sandals, and Anagha made our team win. In another activity, maximum number of upper clothings (vest, shirt, coat etc.) was to be collected. As Grishma removed Amogh’s clothing, he was furious and started to cry. I enjoyed the moment though, and more so, others even more, when we were made to dance to the tunes of gangnam style, lungi dance etc. The last was a ‘couple musical chair’ which we quit mid-way. Our team won handsomely in the end!

Day 3 ended with plans of visiting ‘Talakaveri’, ‘Abbey falls’ and back to Puttur on day 4. I must say we were totally drained out that day, and the big portion of this travel-log dedicated to this day goes to validate that. It was immensely satisfying day!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Day 4 – 24/10/13 - On the way back, Talakaveri and Abbey Falls

Day 4 started with check-out from the resort, and we started at about 9 AM. We thought of going to abbey falls first, but due to my mistake we ended up on the road to talakaveri. I refused to turn back even after realising the mistake, but this wasn’t to Grishma’s liking. As expected, the drive to talakaveri was silence personified! By the time we reached talakaveri after having breakfast on the way, it was 11 AM. The place was filled with clouds and visibility was near to zero. It was a very hard drive in the curving hills. We took about 30 mins at the temple with a ‘kumkum archana’ pooja. With some shopping on the way back, we went to abbey falls.

Abbey falls didn’t take much of our time as it didn’t have a long trek and we were very hungry. We spent just about 15 to 20 mins, but it was a treat to watch as well.

We started to Puttur after lunch at about 3 PM and called up Amma to convey that we will reach by 6 PM. The return drive though was much faster than the onward journey though. We reached Puttur by 5:15 PM. Memorable 4 days of time was spent on the journey of life, and this had left us hungry for more in the coming years!

Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

This journey starts in Amritapuri and ends in Mysores 27h later. This is my first long distance travel in India and I am on my own.

First, I had to wave goodbye to Chloé. It is thank to her if I feel fine starting this journey, I had a great introduction to India. I jumped into a taxi. I got a good price because he had just dropped someone here and didn't want to go back empty.

At the bus station the taxi driver told me ''It's that bus''. So I climb in the designated bus and checked with a passenger ''Is this bus going to Ernakulam?''. Wobble of the head and slight movement of the shoulders and a movement of hand that to me seemed like he was pointing at a seat for me to seat. I was not convinced so I asked the critical question ''Ernakulam stop?''. Few seconds. Movement of head and shoulders and the man goes ‘'Ernakulam bypass''. OK so this is not my bus! I get off and go back to the station looking for a station warden. They are easy to spot, they wear beige uniforms. ‘'Bus to Ernakulam?'' ‘'That side'' said the man pointing at a wall. So I go around that wall, few people are waiting. I ask a woman ‘'Bus to Ernakulam?''. The answer was a wobble of the head and a sign of the hand that seemed to say ‘'stay here''. So I stood by her and looked at the buses coming in and out of the station. Signs are all in Malayalam (local language) so there is no chance I could understand a word. And suddenly, a slap on my harm, a quick head wobble and the women run toward a bus. Ok so that is the bus to Ernakulam, let's go. A man must have seen the scene and asked ‘'where to?'' ‘'Ernakulam''. Wobble of the head. That is definitely the right bus. I'm in! There is lots of empty seats and the back of the bus but I squish my bump next to a women in the second row. Few reasons for this behaviour: front seats are for women because some men don't like seating next to women (so mainly if not only accompanied women go at the back) and the bus have no suspension so at the back it's very bumpy. It is about 4h to Ernakulam. I spent 1h with a women half seating on my lap because the bus was crowded. I like looking outside but I hate looking at the road. They drive like the only commandment is ‘you must not leave an empty space'. It's epic!

From Ernakulam I easily made my way to Fort Kochi to pick up my big backpack that I had left at my previous hotel.

The next challenge was to reach Ernakulam Town train station. I took a bus at Fort Kochi that was supposed to drop me very near. We don't have the same definition of very near. I had to take another bus and then walk about 10min. And that part of town is not very nice, it was very dark. I finally made it to the station after asking my way 2 or 3 times. I was early. So I got some snacks for the ride and found the Ladies-only waiting room to seat and wait.

The train was about 30min late so I had plenty of time to find out where my carriage was. It was at the very front and trains are long long long. Inside, it was easy to find my sleeper and, as most people were already asleep, I just made myself comfortable and ready for bed. I had to take my jumper out of my bag because the AC was on. Good night.

I actually slept rather well. We arrived at Yesvantpur (Bangalore) earlier than scheduled (to my surprise). A rickshaw took me to the other train station. I was there at 10am already hungry so I had a Massala dossa. Spicy food for breakfast was not such a good idea. I think my stomach would have preferred something sweet. I had to wait on platform 7 for about 1h and after another 2h30 in the train I was in Mysore. The journey went smoothly except for the girl who kept wanting to feed me out of date crisp and chocolate. I noticed because the taste was a bit off... My hotel and a well-deserved shower were only a short rickshaw ride away from the train station. I have done it! I guess I can go anywhere now.

Mon périple commence à Amritupiri et se termine à Mysore quelques 27h plus tard. C'est mon premier trajet longue distance en Inde et je suis toute seule. Allez je vous raconte !

Tout d'abord il a fallu dire au revoir à Chloé. C'est grâce à elle que je me sens prête pour entreprendre ce grand trajet toute seule. Elle m'a fait une très bonne introduction de l'Inde. J'ai pris un taxi pour aller jusqu'à la station de bus car il venait de déposer des gens là où j'étais du coup il m'a fait un bon prix. En me posant, le chauffeur m'a dit « c'est ce bus ». Du coup, je monte dans le bus qu'il m'a montré et là je procède à la vérification de rigueur avec un passager. « Est-ce que ce train va à Ernakulam ? ». Mouvement de la tête et petit mouvement d'épaule, accompagnés d'un signe de la main qui semble dire ‘assieds-toi là'. Bon je ne suis quand même pas trop sûre alors je re-vérifie « Arrêt Ernakulam ? ». Après quelques secondes l'homme me regarde, secoue la tête et les épaules et lâche « Contourne ». Bon donc ce n'est pas mon bus ! Je descends et me rend dans la gare routière à la recherche d'un employé. Ils sont en général assez facile à repérer tout habillé en beige. J'en repère un et lui demande « bus pour Ernakulam? ». Mouvement de tête, il pointe un mur et dit « De ce côté ». Donc je contourne le mur dans la direction indiqué et me retrouve avec un petit groupe de personnes. Je demande à deux femmes « bus pour Ernakulam? ». Pour toute réponse j'ai eu droit à un mouvement de tête et un signe de la main qui cette fois veut dire d'attendre ici. Cette fois j'en suis presque sûre donc je ne bouge pas et j'attends. Je regarde le va et vient incessant des bus avec leur affichage en Malayalam (zéro chance que je comprenne quoi que ce soit). J'étais là, perdue dans mes pensées quand tout d'un coup…une tape sur le bras, un mouvement de tête et les femmes s'élancent vers un bus. Bon ça doit être aussi le mien. Un homme qui se dirige aussi vers ce bus me demande « Vers où vous allez ? » « Ernakulam ». Mouvement de tête. Ok c'est le bon bus. J'embarque. Je me trouve une place à l'avant en me serrant contre une dame et ce malgré le fait qu'il y ait plein de places vides à l'arrière. En fait les banquettes avant sont plus ou moins réservées aux femmes alors mieux vaut se mettre là. Et puis il n'y a pas vraiment de suspensions dans les bus ouvert donc à l'arrière ça secoue méchant. Le bus se remplit et je me retrouve avec une femme à moitié assise sur mes genoux pendant près d'1h. Pour les 3h restantes j'ai de la place. J'aime bien regarder le paysage défiler. Par contre j'aime moins regarder devant. Ils conduisent comme si le seul commandement était « sur la route, tu ne dois pas laisser d'espace vide ». Du coup c'est épique !

Une fois à Ernakulam je n'ai pas du tout galéré pour aller récupérer mon gros sac que j'avais laissé à l'hôtel d'avant.

Par contre, rejoindre la station de train Ernakulam town fut plus compliqué. J'ai pris un premier bus qui devait soit disant me déposer tout près. Bon on ne doit pas avoir la même notion de tout près… Il a en fait fallu que je prenne un autre bus, et donc que je demande mon chemin et que je décrypte maints hochements de tête ! Après ce deuxième bus, j'ai dû marcher environ 10min. J'étais bien contente d'arriver à la station car le coin était plutôt sombre et pas super rassurant. Une fois que j'ai eu demandé quel était mon wagon et ma couchette, je me suis acheté des bricoles pour manger dans le train et j'ai patienté dans la salle réservée aux femmes.

Le train avait 30min de retard. Une fois à l'intérieur il y avait déjà des gens qui dormaient donc je me suis installée pour passer la nuit. Evidemment la clim est à fond donc j'ai sorti mon sac à viande et mon sweat. Bonne nuit.

J'ai plutôt bien dormi même si je me suis faite réveiller à 7h du mat' par les autres passagers qui voulaient s'asseoir (j'ai la banquette du bas). On est arrivé à Yesvantpur (Bangalore) en avance. De là j'ai pris un rickshaw jusqu'à l'autre station de train. J'ai mangé une Dossa Masala pour le petit dej' mais je crois que mon estomac aurait préféré quelque chose de moins épicé. J'ai dû attendre 1h sur la plateforme 7 que mon train arrive et 2h30 plus tard j'étais enfin à Mysore. Il m'a fallu prendre un dernier rickshaw enfin d'arriver à mon hôtel. Après une bonne douche (à l'eau froide), j'étais requinquée. En tous cas je me suis plutôt bien débrouillée, je pense que maintenant je dois pouvoir me rendre à peu près partout !

my saree
Geo: 12.314, 76.6759

My first mission in Mysore was to buy a saree. I asked at my hotel where to get one and for what kind of price. A guy told me I would find the best deals at the Government Silk factory. It is also what the Lonely Planet says. So I went there. I gave them my budget and the women didn't try to convince me to get a more expensive one. And what I really liked was that the prices were written on each piece of fabric, which mean they don't make up a price for foreigners.

You get a seat and then the show begins. The women unfolded many sarees on the table in from of me. Everything that had a little bit of pink or purple was eliminated. From the start I liked one that was burgundy and gold with peacock motifs. The good thing is that you can wear them over your shoulder to see if the colour will suit you. I tried few different colours and patterns until the choice was down to two. The above mentioned one and a turquoise blue one with a leaf pattern. After a wee while I settled for the burgundy
how to put a saree on
and gold with peacocks. As they say, first choice is always the best!

Once you have the piece of fabric, they call the tailor, he takes your measurement to make the blouse and the skirt that goes underneath. I also asked them to show me how to put it on. It is not too difficult but it will require some practicing. They also gave me a 'manual' to use as a reminder.

I think I got all that for a rather good price, 2 420 rupees which is about £25. Not bad for a 6m long piece of silk and tailored top.

The tailor brought everything to my hotel and I tried it on. He just said 'You look very different'. No kidding! Look forward to the pictures guys!

Ma mission principale à Mysore est d'acheter un saree. Donc une fois installée à l'hôtel je me renseigne pour savoir où je peux trouver un saree au meilleur prix. L'homme me dit d'aller à la boutique de la fabrique de soie du gouvernement. C'est aussi ce que recommande le Lonely Planet donc j'y vais. En arrivant je leur donne mon budget et la dame ne se met pas en tête de me faire dépenser plus. Et ce que j'ai trouvé vraiment bien c'est que les prix sont écrits sur chaque pièce de soie. Donc ils ne peuvent pas faire un prix différent en fonction du client.

Tu t'assieds et là le show commence. La vendeuse sort une pile de saree et commence à les ouvrir. Tous ceux qui (de près ou de loin) avaient du rose ont été éliminés rapidement. J'ai tout de suite bien aimé un bordeaux et or avec des motifs de paons. Ce qui est bien c'est que tu peux les mettre sur tes épaules pour voir comment ça fait. J'en ai essayé pas mal avant de réduire mon choix à deux. Celui mentionné plus haut et un bleu turquoise et or avec un motif de feuille. Après un long moment d'hésitation j'ai opté pour l'option bordeaux, or et paons. La première idée est toujours la meilleure !

Une fois la pièce de soie choisie, le tailleur vient prendre tes mesures pour faire le haut et la jupe de dessous. J'ai aussi demandé que l'on me montre comment le mettre. Ce n'est pas trop compliqué mais ça va demander un peu d'entraînement. Ils m'ont même donné une feuille avec les explications. Je pense que je me suis bien débrouillée et que je n'ai pas payé trop cher. C'était juste 2 420 roupies ce qui fait un peu moins de 30€. Ce n'est pas si mal pour une pièce de 6m de soie et un haut sur mesure.

Le tailleur m'a tout amené à mon hôtel le soir même. Du coup j'ai essayé l'ensemble et il a dit « Ça vous change » Non, sans blague ! Vous verrez les photos.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Hampi

Published: October 31st 2013
Total Distance: 615.03 miles / 989.8 km
Mouse: 0,0

Distance:

Hyderabad 361 km 7h, 50m

Bangalore 372 km 7h, 10m

Pune 537 km 11h, 20m

Chennai 578 km 12h, 20m

Mumbai 696 km 14h, 50m

Best time to visit: October-March

Road Conditions: Very Good/some patch of village road (Mostly Toll Roads)

Fooding/Lodging: Yes

Days needed to see : average 3 full days.

The historical town of Hampi, is one of the most important tourist destination on the Indian as well as international map. Located in the state of Karnataka, the town is popular for its intricately carved temples and stone sculptures. Some of the most popular temple structures here include Shri Virupaksha Temple, Balakrishna Temple, Shri Vijaya Vitthala Temple and Sasivekalu Ganesh Temple. Few must see are : the Stone Chariot at Vitthala Temple and Ugra Narsimha statue at Lakshmi Narasimha Temple.

For history lovers and for pilgrimage alike, this place offers a lot. Much more about this place can easily be found from various blogs available over internet.

My trip summary and recommendations for Hampi:

In general Hampi can be divided into two sets of places depending on the taste of the traveller.

1. For
Coracle_ride_on_Tungabhadra
Pilgrims : Hampi relates it to the ancient theology of Ramayana. It is considered to be the land of Monkey (Vanara) King Bali and his brother Sugriva, who ruled the kingdom called Kishkinda. This kingdom is identified to be the regions around the Tungabhadra river. The best way to have a peek of this region is to visit “Anjaneya Parvat”, said to be birthplace of Lord Hanuman. This peak offers very nice panoramic view of the Tungabhadra region. Places which can be spotted from there are: Matanga hills, Vitthala temple, Rishimukha Parvat etc. For pilgrims the places that can be covered are: Anjana Mata Temple, Lakshmi Temple, Durga Temple, Anjaneya Temple and Ranganatha Temple. If you are staying in Hampi, the best way to cover all of these is to cross the river from the Hampi Bazaar’s side. There is a frequent boat/coracle service which charges 10/50 rupees per trip respectively. Then you can take moped or negotiate for an auto rickshaw to show you all of these places. If you have stamina left then you can choose to cross river from the Anegundi village’s side and cover few more spots on the way back to Hampi at your stay.
Elephant_Stables


2. For History and Architecture lovers: Hampi and nearby places offer most of what Hampi is known for. You can start your day after taking a bath in the nearby ghat and then head towards “Virupaksha Temple”. Then you can plan you morning covering Hemakuta Hills, Kadalekalu Ganesha Temple, Sri Krishna Temple, Badavilinga Temple, Narasimha Temple, Veerabhadra Temple, Sister Stones, and the Main Royal enclosure of Hampi which has plenty of places exhibiting amazing sculpture work on stones, done mostly during the Vijayanagar kingdom. My recommendation would be “Hazara Rama Temple” to witness mostly preserved art work depicting the stories of Lord Rama from Ramayana. You can head back to Hampi bazaar for lunch and have some rest as it gets too hot during afternoon.

Evening: get ready for a walk of around 3+ hours taking you to divine history. Start towards Hampi main bazaar street and feel the glory of most blossomed Vijayanagar empire having a street market which is known to be selling precious gems and other commodities. Take left to the royal walk way towards river. You will get to see a soothing Tungbhadra. You can get a coracle ride across the river to see
Hampi_Bazaar_from_Matanga_Hills
few other secret places, one of them is the “Sahasra lingaam”. On the way ahead you can see few other temples and finally the most hyped “Vitthala Temple”. This temple is indeed of much interest and worth taking a guide who charges 150 rupees. This temple houses the most spectacular structure called “The Stone Chariot”. If you have enough time you can covers the nearby places which do passes amazing beauty of tranquillity else you can head straight towards main road. You can take a ride on the electrically operated vehicle which drops you at the gate side and charges 10 rupees each passenger. Take an auto back to you stay.

Next day you can plan for Matanga hills. People generally to go up to see sunset rather than sun rise for a better view. Depending on your plan you can over few more places of your interest at the foot hill of Matanga hills like; Veerabhadra Temple and Achutaraya Temple. Sun generally goes down at 6:30 PM and it gets dark very fast then after, so avoid staying at the peak for too late.

My travel itinerary says minimum 3 days for Hampi but you can make
hampi_ghats
it in 2 days if willing to skip few places and have lots of stamina to walk and climb. You can opt to stay in main Hampi Bazaar or stay across the river where you can find better options for food as well as for lodging.

If you get little more adventurous then probably you can follow my trip itinerary which covers few other place, obviously it will cost you few more days J : https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=215053520020715622475.0004e2565d6c1b32465b3&msa=0

A trip to the south Indian temple town of Kumbakonam is indeed a very informative and exhilarating experience.The trip invariably leads one to the various temples of the Chola dynasty replete with religious fervour and architectural finesse.I commenced my journey from Bangalore and travelled by an overnight train.It covered the journey of about 600 Kms in 11 hrs.This small temple town draws crowds who come mainly to pay obeisance to the presiding deities of the navagraha temples.Some of these temples are indeed marvels of architecture built by the Cholas.It definitely helps if one has a personal transport since the temples are situated in different directions and to make it to all these places in a brief span of time can be strenuous and tiresome.There are a number of hotels for the budget conscious traveller.

One could also include Thanjavur in the itinerary which is known as the granary of South India due to its extensive paddy growing fields which are a feast for the eyes'As regards accomodation at Kumbakonam one can pick and choose an accomodation suited to one's budget.Typical Indian or specifically South Indian cuisine is available in most of the hotels.It is better to have one's own transport

Asia » India » Karnataka » Chikmagalur
September 21st 2013
Published: April 19th 2016


We're almost there !
I was hoping for a monsoon ride in 2013 but it did not happen due to some reasons, so thought of recompensing it with a drive. It was almost end of monsoon and one of my friend and my colleague (then) Kunche Swamy was okay with the plan as he was not very fond of long rides. None of us had a car, so hired one, and it came on time to pick me up around 10.30 pm. We had one more person with us to fill the seat, Venkat – Swamy’s friend.

After picking everyone, we reached Tumkur highway by 12.30, and then stretched to Chcikmagalur by stopping once or twice for tea. While going, Swamy could not hold the very desire to drive a car on a highway, but the driver refused it with a smile.

Chickmagaluru : We reached Chikmagalur town early in the morning, its around 260km from Bangalore. I do not remember whether we took rest in a hotel room or straightaway left to Mullayangiri Peak. I remember reading some broachers available there regarding Chikmagalur and places nearby. Chickmagalur literally means ""The town of the younger daughter"" in the native Kannada language. The town
Ch!ll!ng Wind @ Mullayangiri Peak
is said to have been given as a dowry to the younger daughter of Rukmangada, the great chief of Sakrepatna and hence the name . This is the story I hv read somewhere online. Chikmagalur was one of the place where coffee was cultivated early in ‘India’ soil. Rivers like Tunga - Bhadra have their sources in the mountains here which are parts of the Western Ghats. Chickmagalur district also contains Mullayanagiri, the highest peak in Karnataka.

The city is placed within a scenic landscape in a fertile valley; it is surrounded by lush green coffee plantation hills. The distance from Bangalore makes this place a perfect weekend getaway, and if that happens to be in monsoon through the Western Ghats, man you wouldn’t have to think twice.

Mullayanagiri : This is the highest peak in Karnataka, located within the range of the Western Ghats of Chikmagalur Taluk, and one of the best trekking place in south India as well.

On the way, when the scene became bit bright, we got down from the cab for an early morning photo-shoot near some estate gate. We reached peak after a tough drive, it was foggy and rainy too,
MoodScape
finally just before the peak, we got down from the cab as we could not see anything in the front. We used mobile phone indicator application to give driver some clues. Unless you are an expert in driving seat, stay away driving till the peak. The road to Mullayanagiri is very narrow with views from steep cliffs. Driving to the peak is almost impossible and includes a trek up the hill from the half-way point. From the topmost point on the hill, the Arabian Sea might be visible on clear days. However, ours was not a day of such weather.

The earlier you reach, the better the sight, else it may start raining, but we couldn’t make it early. With the light rain we climbed the stairs to the top. The rainy winds were so powerful; we were feeling we might be thrown down the hill at any point of time. Nevertheless, it was a life time experience to cherish. I feel chilled while writing about it. We lost our way while coming back, the driver had looked for a short cut to Kemmanagundi.

Kemmangundi : I do not remember whether we ate something until we reached Kemmanngundi.
Fairy-tale Land : Mesmerizing Place on the way to Kemmanagundi
Oh yes we has some snacks and tea at Mullayangiri . The one thing I can’t comprehend (in Karnataka) was the smallest glasses (plastic) used for serving tea at many places. I wish I had carried a cup.

The route through Kemmanagundi Hills were terrible, so much of, super muddy potholes, (scene might have changed now.) we were anticipating soon we have to come out of the cab and push it from behind, or we would be getting a flat tire, but nothing happened. We often stopped and captured the fairy tale scenic views on the way. Then reached top of a hill called Rajendra Hill, which we heard is extremely rich in iron ore. Rajendra Hill is one of the highest peaks in Karnataka encompassed by coffee plantations. We then got into same Krishnarajendra Hill Station Park.

We spent some time and had some late lunch there in a motel. We then moved to Habbi/Hebbe falls to give the day a dashing end. It was raining at times. On the way we saw mesmerizing hills in different moods and shapes and was about to set the sun off.

Habbi/Hebbe Falls : Hebbe Falls are located few
At Hebbe Falls
km away from Kemmangundi hill station . By the time we reached there, it was late in the evening. These sprightly falls are inside a coffee estate and can be reached either by walk or four-wheeler, Surrounded by dense forests and coffee plantations. Don’t miss a refreshing dip in this herb-infused water. If you want to come here, Let the monsoon come first, then a trip through the Western Ghats .

Initially, we had to take a small diversion to get on the “road” to Hebbe Falls. When it’s pouring in monsoon, it becomes a slushy mess that can be navigated only by cars with good ground clearance. As we neared the place beyond which cars can’t go, we got down from the car, as soon as we started walking, leeches attacked us from all directions. Man, the only way to escape was to go back or run faster and faster. I was not wearing a shoe then, but a sandal with a strap, so leaches could easily stick and suck my blood. The surroundings were dripping wet, fresh and aromatic due to rain.

After a short 20 minute run and crossing three streams, we heard the thunder
Motel at Hill Station Park
of the waterfall. As with the thunder, my heartbeat also increased. What we saw next was a sight to behold!

Tremendous amounts of water were cascading down two levels of the waterfall. We could not capture the other level due to misty weather in the late evening. The water spray was too much to handle. We couldn’t even keep our eyes open. There was no much people around except the few of us, and I think Venkat has not come till the end. We could not spent a long time near the waterfall and getting wet and dark. We could not take much pics due to slight rain and fog in the air. We should ‘ve reached bit early.

The fun was to get rid off leaches while we were back to cab, none of us had any spare dress, except a towel and a boxer kept for shower in the falls, we removed everything and each one helped other for finding leaches from the body, and Swamy sat in the cab only in towel, me in boxer, somehow dried our t-shirts and banyans to make a run to the hotel room when we reached in Chikmagalur town.
Swamy teaching the lady how to use smartphone


kudremukh : The next day early morning, after shower we checked-out from the hotel and had breakfast outside. The plan was to go to kudremukh for a trek. 95 kms southwest of Chikmagalur is the secluded hill station of Kudremukh. Situated 1894 m above sea level, the Kudremukh hills overlook the Arabian Sea and are chained to one another with deep valleys and steep cliffs. There is rich flora and fauna here, waiting to be discovered. There was a lot to be explored. A lovely places to camp. No trekker would be able to resist Kudremukh

We were going through the tea estates and we stopped for some clicks perhaps a freshly made tea from the same tea estate. A young lady from the small shop made tea for us from her house just behind the shop, it had a unique taste. We were chatting with her while having tea. Her subservience and some sort of rural innocence were very aesthetic and feminine. Swamy had tough time in explaining some old ladies who work in the tea estate on how to operate a smart-phone, but even after his lecture they were unable to take his pics. He posed
Kudremukh hills
again when I took my cam in hand. Another fun happened when we left the place and all of a sudden remembered I had forgot my pullover in the shop. When we reached the shop again, the pullover was not there. We looked everywhere. Again we got into the cab and later realized I was wearing the same pullover. I wondered how come even others were not find it on me!

Finally we were at the starting place of Kudremukh trek , but we were so disappointed to hear from the localities that the trek tem with the guide had left an hour before we reached. It wouldn’t be prudent to go without a guide for first timers. So we finally thought to have an early lunch from a small hotel and the meals were delicious. The lady who supplied the food felt so happy by seeing the way I was having it. The disappointment of the trek miss throgh amazing kudremukh hills faded a bit after the food.

So we thought we will have a drive through the hills in other direction and perhaps do some chilling in another falls nearby Kudremukh hills. So finally we reached
HanumanaGundi Falls
though we lost our way in between. Someone had shifted the sign board to a wrong direction

HanumanaGundi Falls : This Falls is situated in Kudremukh National Park between Kudremukh Road and Lakya Dam. The site featuring this beautiful waterfall is a popular climbing spot. The 100 ft waterfall can be accessed from 400 steps that are climbed down from the main road to reach the site. Hanumana Gundi Falls is managed and maintained by forest department of the state government. Along with the fall, tourists can also visit Bhagavathi Nature Camp. I had this dejavu feeling when I reached here and while stepping down close to falls. Yes few years back when I visited mangalore with my colleagues to attend a friend’s marriage at Uduppi, we had visited here while coming back. Since we alredy had too much experience in water and rain and fog previous day, we laft the falls after an hour or so. We had evening tea. Then while coming back visited one more place called Lakya Dam.

The Lakya dam was not like a dam as we expected. As per the information shared , it is a check dam built across the river
Lakya Dam
Lakya, a tributary of the Bhadra river. The dam was constructed by Kudremukh Iron Ore Company. This dam was built with the objective to collect silt and other waste materials from the mining industries situated beyond Kudremukh. The dam also acts as a source for the irrigation of agricultural lands in Kudremukh.

The dam gives an awesome views for photo enthusiasts and peace of mind for nomads . We spent some quality time there and when the sun was almost ready to set completely, they were ready to close the gates.

We then did not made any further plan other than coming back!

Geology Rocks! - Ross Gellar, NY

Stepping off yet another overnight sleeper train with the standard array of snorers, starers and people that think it’s acceptable to hock the nastiest sounding loogies from way up in their sinuses and flob them out the window, we arrived in Hospet.



From Hospet, we would need to take a 30 minute or so Tuk tuk to Hampi for which we were already dreading the obligatory haggling with the local drivers. ‘Fortunately’ for us, there was a guy on our train who had a tuk tuk parked outside (how this was possible, I don’t know) who followed us down the platform asking if we needed a ride into town. Having had this kind of hassle many times before, we decided to sit on the platform with a cup of unbelievably sweet tea and wait him out. Not realising this was probably the only driver we had come across in Asia with a tiny bit of patience, he played us at our own game, dug in his heels and called our bluff. After about 20 minutes of this, he appeared to finally cave, and came over quoting us a good price…we were
Streets of the Bazaar
shocked. Looks like this actually worked? We would be testing this theory again for sure.

Sure enough, half an hour passed and we were whizzing around the skinny dirt streets of Hampi Bazaar dodging everything from people, bikes, other Tuk tuks, cows and of course cowpat before arriving safely outside our hotel of choice, Rocky’s.

Straight away, we knew this was more our scene. Chilled and relaxed, plenty of fellow travellers around (it had been sometime since we had seen other ‘travellers’) and more Ali Baba pants than you can shake a monkey stick at…. Finally a place we felt we could get on board with.

After registering our arrival with the police (everyone has to do this, we are not known criminals or anything) we took a walk around Hampi.

This place has been described as beautiful, magical, and even otherworldly, and on first glimpses of the terrain and landscape here, we could easily see why. Hampi hosts some of the most incredible ruins either of us have ever seen, all of which are surrounded and sometimes embedded in a mass of giant boulders and rocks that stretch as far as the eye can see.

It really is one of them places that needs to be seen to be believed, and also one that is on a huge scale.

The first set of ruins we went to visit seemed to go on for miles, with amazing architecture everywhere you looked. Not wanting to see too much of the area to quickly, we stopped after a good few hours to ‘save’ some temples for another day. After coming back to the bazaar however, we were shocked to find that we had only covered a tiny piece of what this place had to offer, and if you wanted to, you could probably spend weeks here exploring.

We quickly decided that this was a place we would like to hang out in for a few more days, and spent plenty of that time flitting between temples and walks among the landscape, with relaxing and reading on the floor cushions of the local restaurants and cafes.

The closest temple to the bazaar has a resident elephant, Lakshmi who will ‘bless’ you for 1 rupee. This consists of putting a coin in Lakshmi’s trunk who then passes the coin to the handler. She then blesses you by
Lakshmi the blessing elephant
raising her trunk and patting you on the head with it…. Quite amazing I must admit. Not usually one for gimmicks like this, I couldn’t resist a blessing from an elephant guru and decided to part with my rupee. I was shocked when Lakshmi refused the coin and my blessing was snubbed. Knowing that I was a tourist, she wanted 10 rupees from me! Obviously this was either from an invisible signal from the handler, or this elephant really was a guru or something , but either way, I was strangely impressed and so parted with 10 rupees (about 10p). Again realising I was a tourist, Lakshmi’s trunk was resting on my head for longer than the locals so we could get the photo….amazing stuff!

The next day, we were able to see Lakshmi get her daily wash down by the river, and having watched this and seeing her thoroughly enjoying it, we were reassured that she was being treated well which pleased us both.

Hampi really was exactly what we were looking for after such a rollercoaster ride in India so far, and sitting here writing this on our roof terrace as the day draws to a
Ladies...
close, we will both be sad to leave this little slice of heaven. However, it’s time to motivate, and we are now off to Goa. Being the rainiest month to visit Goa (July), we are certainly not expecting much in the way of sun, however we hope to enjoy the little capital of Panaji for a few days.

Signing off…

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mysore
July 23rd 2013
Published: August 10th 2013


St Philomenas Church
‘’Its not about how hard you can hit, it’s about how hard you can be hit and keep moving forward – Rocky Balboa



So, after a fairly relaxing time in Kodai, we were off in search of even more downtime in the city of Mysore, home of Ashtanga Yoga.

We had booked ourselves into a great little hotel not too far from the centre for a great price and were looking forward to seeing what Mysore had to offer. We were willing to stay here for a few weeks or even a month if we liked the feel of the place and if we could get something good going on with one of the local Yoga places….but with no real plans, we were just going to play this by ear.

Our first venture out of the hotel by foot seemed to be a clear indication of what Mysore was going to be like for us, and in all honesty, we should have realised there and then, that this wasn’t going to be our favourite place. Without a map or a clear idea of where the main town or where the major focal point -
Mental streets of Mysore
Maharaja’s palace was, we hit the streets of Mysore. Going the completely wrong direction to the aforementioned landmarks, we ended up wandering the clogged and crazy streets before finally seeing something we recognised. It was St Philomena’s Church and to be honest was hard to miss. Knowing this wasn’t really where we wanted to be, we were still glad to be in the vicinity of a large landmark that we had at least heard of. Walking towards the church however, brought us a hoard of unwanted guests. Tuk tuk drivers, taxis, unofficial guides and even carpet salesman attached themselves to us like flies round shit. Being at what would seem to be a fairly touristy sight, we assumed there would be other tourists getting some of the share of hassle, however being the only westerners close by, we may as well of had ‘Please…try ripping us off’ plastered across our foreheads, with an addition of ‘If we say No Thank-you, just try ten times harder and I’m sure we will change our minds’

It was relentless.

So, after a quick look around the place and posing for a few Indian tourists photos, we promptly made a bolt for
Locals that insisted on a photo with Donna
the exit. Perhaps not making ourselves clear the first ten times, the same undeterred faces were waiting for us for another go at selling us stuff we didn’t need nor want. Man, these guys were persistent.

After finally escaping from the church, dodging traffic as well as a few goats and cows, we finally found ourselves a hotel in which to have lunch and more importantly to get away from the chaos of the streets. This was essential as having little sleep from the train and no breakfast, we were just about ready to lose it.

Our next day was probably the best one we had in Mysore, where we visited the Maharaja’s Palace. This wonderful structure really was quite amazing inside and out, and along with all the visual charms and interesting history, it also served as a great way to escape from the craziness that was on the other side of those walls…..

Having had this fine day, and growing in confidence with walking around the streets, dodging stares, invites to tours and what not, we decided to head into the epicentre of chaos and to take a look around the Devaraja Market.

What
Beautiful Palace
on earth were we thinking? Just when we thought we were getting better at batting off people and staying incognito, we decided to do this……

Upon reaching the outskirts of the market, we were mooching around and taking in the sights and the smells of this bustling area, and then we made our way into the market itself. Being the only tourists around, we were of course immediately jumped on by every market seller in the place.

It was uncomfortable to say the least for me, however with no women to be seen it was even worse for Donna. After about 3 minutes into being pulled this way and that to buy this or smell that etc, Donna then had her arse grabbed by some shady guy who disappeared off into the carnage. Despite wanting to see the market in full swing and take a few snaps, this was too much as far as we were concerned, and so we swiftly made our way to the exit, fuming at the guy who had ruined our visit, and really quite horrified at some of the people walking around here. I understand some people may take this with a pinch
Colouful
of salt and say it’s to be expected, but for us, it’s just a massive invasion of space and no one should have to put up with this crap, anywhere.

For the rest of the day, we stewed on this incident, and really started to question why we were here. Why were we putting ourselves though this kind of stuff? The stares, the constant badgering, the trash everywhere and now this. It just all seemed to hit us at that moment, and we both just felt like throwing the towel in there and then…it was just one of those moments I guess.

Deciding perhaps booking some Yoga would brighten our time here, we were disappointed to learn that most people that come here for the Yoga was on a month training basis etc and there were generally specific dates that courses started on. The course that we wanted to get on wasn’t for another few weeks, so this just seemed to add to our already sombre moods.

Still, after time to cool off, a nice dinner and some beers, we shook off the bad vibe we had and decided to just get on with things. We knew
Having a beer
that India wasn’t going to be the easiest place to travel, and that there would be things to test us along the way, but that was almost one of the pulls of travelling this place for us, the challenge. We could easily have decided to quit and go somewhere easy and less frantic, but where’s the fun in that? Having dusted ourselves off, we agreed to head to the Railway museum. To be honest, this didn’t sound hugely appealing as neither of us own an anorak nor do we get our kicks from trains, however, this place was billed as a ‘’half a day of pure fun’’ in the guide, and so we thought sod it, why not. In all fairness it was actually much better than both of us anticipated, and rather than being a boring, stuffy indoor museum with a million facts to read, the place was outdoors and more of a railway graveyard than a museum. This was great as the inner kid came out in us both as we climbed on-board the old trains and played with the controls (I probably did this a little more than Donna if truth be told!) Not long after we
Donna playing on the train
had begun jumping on the trains and taking photos it happened…….

….. I said something to Donna that I have never said to her in all the 15 years we have been together and which I’m hoping I won’t have to repeat anytime soon. I can’t go into too much detail as Donna insists this is in bad taste (I of course disagree), but you’ll get the idea from this one comment I made not long after excitedly jumping off train number 4 and feeling a grumble in my stomach that required some immediate attention ….

Mike: ‘’Man that was way too close, and it was proper grim in there. Gonna need to replace what’s left of those Calvins’’

Sooooo, moving on from that picture I have no doubt sadly ingrained in your head now, we decided to snap out of our moods and concentrate on our next destination, Hampi.

If the rumours were true of this place, it would be a far cry from city life and would be somewhere we wouldn’t regret coming to. This sounded promising.

Hampi, turn these frowns upside down please!

The LONGEST day of my life

Who knew it was possible to experience one day for more than twenty-four hours???

Sounds impossible, but it can be done and I have lived it! I lived 30 hours of July 20, 2013. It started out in Bangalore, India and ended in Chicago, Illinois, USA.

Leaving was bittersweet. I enjoyed my time in India, but I missed the United States and the people I love back there. It was a nice experience to undergo and I am very glad I participated. I am very glad I went to the Taj Mahal and was able to successfully tour Delhi by myself and not get sold into the slave trade (I was so nervous for that…).

The people were phenomenal, so hospitable.

Just because the residency ended, doesn't mean the adventure did. When we left for the airport, it was almost midnight. The bus couldn't make it into the parking lot so we had to walk out to the busy street and load. This was also where we said goodbye to our WorldStrides chaperone – Cheten. We all got comfortable in our seats and I remember thinking to myself how dry my eyes were and so thankful I had taken out my contacts. I remember listening to others reflect about the experience. I thought I would just shut my eyes for a few moments (to lubricate them), but ended up falling asleep. I guess everyone pretty much crashed on the ride to the airport. Suddenly we were all awaken when the bus almost got hit by a water tanker on the expressway. By this time we were very near the airport, so I stayed awake the rest of the way. The other thing I remember thinking on the bus was how bright the lights were from the oncoming traffic in the other lane.

When we got to the airport, our luggage was unloaded and we said goodbye to our driver, Edward – phenomenal doesn't even begin to describe his driving skills, especially in the chaos we were exposed to!!! We also said goodbye to our navigator.

Before we could enter the airport, we had to show some sort of proof that we had a flight, so I showed them my printed receipt/ticket confirmation. I was one of the first who was waved through. And the security put me into a different line than my counterparts, who were waved to other lines. I got through before them and looked around and figured I would wait for them near the airline. But, someone from the airline saw me and must’ve figured I was loitering, so they brought me to the check in area for my airline. I got in the line for economy, but, then was asked to move to first class for my check in…I told the lady I was with a group, but she said, they’d be on their way and that I should check my bag. So, I did what she asked. I figured after I checked my bags, I would wait before going on to security and again, I ushered to the escalator for security. Enough was enough and I figured I would just have to catch up with the group at the gate. So, I went through customs and security quite smoothly. No waits or anything, just flew through them. When I go to the gate area, I looked around and there were still a bunch of people there waiting for the flight that was before ours, so I went back to the duty free area to wait for the gang. They were worried I got lost, so I sent the Program Manager a text that I was through and fine. It took some time, for them to catch up to me, so I am glad I didn’t wait. I am also glad I went on my own, because sometimes when in a group, it can cause security to be suspicious and I didn’t want to cause anything like that because I wanted to get home and get onto my next adventure.

My last few purchases were the India Barbie and a tuk-tuk – best part – they let me pay in $USD$!!! Did some reading and reorganizing. By the time it was time to board (around 2:30 am), I was tired. Even so, I still look a sleeping pill. Luckily, I was in a first row seat with extra leg room.

Landing in Germany was a great feeling – while it was not home, no longer were there gawks and stares as I walked through the airport. Here, I was not a creature from the nother world, but a normal person. It gave me a great sense of relief. And while I was relieved to be in the West, I really craved a shower, but I did the next best thing and freshened up in the bathroom. Thank goodness there was some time to kill. When we landed it was about 2 PM in Bangalore, 9 AM in Germany and 1 AM in the Midwest.



The flight from Germany to Chicago was more uncomfortable, but I think partly was due to the anxiousness of getting home and just wanting to be home.

Friday

Our last day of the residency of getting packed prior to our departure for the morning. Our last two visits consisted of GE and Micro-labs But before we could get to either, we got to experience a true Indian traffic jam. It took us about 2.5 hrs to go less than 20 miles. From GE we were off to Micro-labs who served us Jainism food.

The part of GE we visited was GE Aviation as two of the students work there in the USA. At GE they are big on digital solutions for aviation and being able to effectively use data. The compound has been in Bangalore since it began in 1999. It is a global research center - facility for 300 ppl, aviation 700, P&E, transportation, health care

The main competitor is Rolls Royce. And the motto is “bring them home safely”

GE typically doesn't make profits on engines, the profits are made on services. GE India started as a joint venture first few years, which were a test relationship and were a validation stage. It proved to be successful and is now its own entity.

Top down prioritization occurs a lot, but it
2013-07-19 10.35.57
is important to note that labor cost is not a prime factor - talent is a driving factor, and experience is also a big factor. Often, if GE will lose people they will go to Honeywell, John Deere, or other automotive companies.

People who leave, tend to do so around 5 or 6 years. Recruitment is often done from the top 5 schools, which located all over the country.

Flex working schedule certain hrs. need to work and can work any other hrs. as desired

As long as work gets done, flex schedule is ok to take advantage if which is mainly by females

Our second stop was to Micro-labs Before we got into the business side, they fed us lunch. It was a traditional Jain lunch. Jainism is a sect of Hinduism that does not believe in eating food grown beneath the earth’s surface (nor do they eat meat – as most Hindus are vegetarians), so no potatoes, no carrots, no beets. Little did I know but this was going to be my favorite meal of the entire trip. It was incredible delicious!

Micro-labs is a generic pharmaceutical company. R&D consists of reverse engineer
2013-07-19 13.32.33
drugs after patents run out. R&D was the main focus of the presentation. Because health is in the details. This company was established in 1993 and headquartered in Bangalore. Products are in major therapeutic segments. Manufacturing capabilities in oral solids, oral liquids, topical to injectable and eye drops.

Manufacture and market medicine of the highest quality at the most affordable price. Big generic company – have markets in Europe, US in New Jersey, Guatemala. All sites are USFDA approved.

For Generic medicine to try an innovate, they need to develop formulation that only require one dose a day and have a steady release of the drug throughout the day in a controlled manner.

Patent law is big – a patent is good for 20 years, but it takes 7 years to bring a drug to market, so by then only 13 years remain on the patent Drug companies try to block generic – can research the drugs prior to the patent expiration but cannot bring it to market. Patents can also be challenged. With 40 products in the US market, they are already challenging 10 patents at this time.

20-30% of the company’s budget goes to
2013-07-19 18.53.50
litigation and counsel.

Often when there is a recall of a drug, it means that poor developed process occurred, especially at the beginning other development.

Most of the employees hold Masters degrees.

NDDS – New Drug Delivery System. Work on a lot of drugs for the African Markets. There is a big concentration on SOPs and workflow for documentation, like any other business. The Main focus in the prescription drug market through distribution channels like Walgreen's in the US. I found this presentation very fascinating and almost thought about asking if they would sell me any sumatriptan for my migraines 😉

After we left Micro-labs it was off to the hotel to finish packing and say our goodbyes. There was some time left before we had to leave and there were some final things I wanted to buy. So my partner and I ventured out to the emporium, the market place and the grocery store to get place mats scarves and trinkets, and spices. We got caught in a monsoon and my shoes ended up getting soaked. Good thing these were cheap shoes I had originally intended on throwing away. I did just that, threw them
2013-07-19 19.07.47
away and took out another pair to wear instead. We weighed our luggage. Luckily with everything I had purchased, I was under weight.

For dinner a few of us ventured to Karavelli – one of the best restaurants in the world. We had a nice three course meal and I had three glasses of champs. They split the bill evenly as we all had a bunch to eat and drink and my portion was less that 40 USD! Pretty amazing for the last day in India – and the FOOD – to DIE FOR!!! So good. We got done and it was about 9 pm and we still had about two and half hours before we had to leave….bittersweet. After everything I have done in India, were I went, what I saw, what I ate, I could see myself coming back here again. I could also see myself living here as an expat for a few years….Now just have to convince Mr. Markus.

2013-07-18 10.19.46
This was a big day for my partner and I, as we were going to be presenting to Infosys in the afternoon. First, we had a stop at Intel.

Intel India doesn't have its own website from Intel, like 3M had, so the link is to Intel India’s website. The campus is fairly large. There we had presentations from couple of people and were given a tour of the Testing facility - pretty sweet to see all the latest and greatest tablets, smartphones, and notebooks.

Intel’s mission is to create computing technology to make life easier for everyone on the globe. They invest a lot in rsearch and design. The site we were at in Bangalore is the largest non-manufacturing site outside USA. Much insight was re-laid on how starting an office is challenge and getting the right talent needed is even more of challenge. In order to be a Fellow at Intel, a very respected position in the company, the person has to make a choice – to either follow the technical side or to follow the management side. One can only become a Fellow after making a bunch of contributions to the company and one has to be
2013-07-18 10.20.15
handpicked for it.

Many people are saying the PC is dead, but that means the market is expanding into o smartphones and tablets. The big thing here is that there must be similar experiences across devices, there must be security – so Intel must be able to get processors in all areas. While maintaining a focus on humanity – this was a very prevalent theme at every business in India the humanity aspect of business.

To focus on Humanity, Intel gives a LOT of money back to various organizations. They also have an interesting donation program. So let’s say that I work for Intel and I volunteer for 20 hrs. One week at a local charity, I would record my volunteer hours and Intel would take what I would have earned in those 20 hrs. And make a financial donation to the charity – pretty cool. This is likely a reason why Intel is so successful. Is the #2 best Company to work for the #2 Best Company (behind only Google).

Intel requires a ton of software development, but surprisingly enough they don’t just recruit from the top school. They will recruit from tier 1,2,3 level schools
2013-07-18 13.03.24
as well as they work with the universities to develop curriculum that will ensure the pipeline of new entrants into the workplace are well prepared. Because of its culture, Intel is a very sought after company and people stay at Intel for many years – there is quite a high retention rate. The part I liked best about this is they encourage global movement within the company, as expanding people’s physical boundaries, will also expand their professional boundaries making them more of an asset to a global company in the global business environment.

Even if people don’t move across the globe, they are still required to grow at Intel. There is a lot of working across time zones for project, yielding to more nontraditional working schedule. This has prompted Intel to create a more work/life balance culture, even allowing employees to work from home. Intel is able to do this because every project they undertake is clearly mapped out and key players know exactly what is expected from them, and likely when it is due. Intel has created centers for excellence which tap into cross functional divisions within the company, but around the globe. There is a lot of
2013-07-18 13.03.25
matrix reporting within the company. This allows for agile manufacturing and PMP certified office employees – which are indicative of the complex processes Intel has. Throughout the history of Intel India, the objections of the location have evolved. This location is key to working with the government and getting investment for technology, developing the organization and allowing things to group. Initially it was set up and ran much like a US office, but now it is becoming more and more its own Indian office.

The second part of our presentation dealt with Sales and Marketing. I found this to be even more fascinating. In India there is a big market for young people – India is much younger than China, but there are many deep and distinct divides. Bollywood is very popular; most are Hindi and they cater to many cultures within the country. There is a big use for using this platform for marketing and branding. Cricket is also very popular and another platform for marketing – it is also good for promoting unity. In India there are many festivals, and to have strategic marketing, it would be wise to have a presence at the festival. Other popular
2013-07-18 17.44.50
platforms for young people in India are Google+, and LinkedIn – Indians make up a big part of the user ship in these social media networks.

An interesting phenomena we learned about was how India invented the missed call. In India, a person can never be charged for an incoming phone call. This made it very easy for working class people to purchase a phone. Whenever they need to get in touch with their boss, they would call the number, let it ring once and hang up. The boss would see the missed call and call the employee back. The employee was never charged for the call.

The tablet market in India is growing fast as is the first time buyer market. Actually the first time buyer market is quite large in India. Intel divides the market into the Affluent, the Aspirers and the Strivers. PC Penetration is only 10% right now, but the buy cycle is a long time, as people often have to save up for it. Most of the people who have advanced technology in India are the globals – the early adopters. The middle class is determined to make a better life for their
2013-07-18 18.00.47
children, so they will be more often than not the core of the first time buyers. Aspirers are very cautious.

For lunch we headed to Electronic City where we were able to enjoy some pizza hut pizza. I had pepperoni and it tasted yummy. My partner and I had to eat fast so we could work on our presentation – nothing like waiting until the last minute.

Then, it was off to Infosys. Infosys is a very large technology, business consulting firm. Here, my partner and I proposed that Infosys create a department called BID – Business integration Department, where they take small companies and align them with enterprise customers who happen to be government contractors. Infosys thought it was a great idea !

Infosys is not a product company – they are a problem solving company for clients. Everything is highly regarding toward the customer relationship. Innovation to address a specific need. Business model is based upon a strategy which flows from employees to clients and then to partners. Infosys strives to be relevant to client’s needs. Payment is done per transaction and is very flexible depending up on the situation and the client and the
2013-07-18 19.05.26
services being provided. Infosys likes to have a five year strategy. Employees are in the labs and tap into the employee knowledge through the centralized system Infosys. New ideas are top down and bottom up innovation. Co-create the Centers of Excellence with clients to learn from clients

Some times with competitors in the environment, if the service requires a joint venture / collaborative effort. 97% of Infosys business comes from repetitive clients; seldom do they require new clients, because the business model is heavily reliant on relationship building. The top ten clients receive direct contact from the board. Infosys invests in talent and because to gain trust with their employees.

The US is the largest spender on IT outsourced and 80% of those employees are based in India. There is often a balancing act of going global and remaining relevant locally. Not able to crack the Chin market for a few years. Transfer money to local market and recruit local talent for employment. Very little spent on marketing but didn’t’ work in China. They had to transfer money to local markets and recruit local talent/ Very little spent on marketing but didn’t working in China. Relationship based Research
2013-07-18 20.28.23
clients. Very big on the culture and value system and competency in both. After a presentation by Infosys and video about their founding and sustainability efforts, we were given a tour of their 45 + building campus in Bangalore – the main hub for Infosys.

When we got home it was still pretty early, so I went out and did some shopping at the emporium and then bartered with some merchants. It was a LOT of fun to be able to do that. Luckily, I was fast and got in and got what I wanted for the price I was and was able to return before the monsoon hit. The hotel staff had provided us with a cocktail hour so one of the guys and I decided to partake.

Following cocktails, we were off to the Hyatt for a full 5 course Indian dinner. It was very yummy. When we returned, one of the guys had purchased some Cuban cigars and some of us enjoyed the end of our trip by smoking one. I didn’t finish mine…after that it was off to bed.

Third Day of Residency

This was probably the most interesting day of the entire trip. This day we were heading to a town (by Indian standards, city by American standards) outside of Bangalore called Mysore. There is large, beautiful palace there we were going to tour. After the tour, we had lunch and then were off to a rural village to see where some of the Selco solar panels are being utilized today.

It was about a three hour bus ride to Mysore. We made a stop halfway through to get coffee and take a bathroom break. However, in the bathroom stalls, there was no paper. We had to get the paper handed to us by the lady who looked like she was there to clean the bathroom. When I came out to wash my hands, I went to the sink that wasn’t being used at the time and she shooed me from it and made me wait for my counterpart to finish. After that she handed us paper towels to dry out hands. We walked out. She followed us and stared. I guess we were supposed to pay for her ‘services’. Understanding everyone has a place in Indian
2013-07-17 08.51.40
society and being culturally sensitive to that – fine, but seriously, I’d rather just get my own paper to wipe my butt.

We were back on the bus and onto Mysore. The drive was wonderful as we were able to see a lot of the country side. When we finally got to Mysore, we were warned about the vendors who would try to stop us – they can be very persistent. Something I found intriguing about Mysore was the prevalence of St. Philomena, a Catholic saint who has a shrine in Briggsville, WI – I pass by the turn off every time I go to the Dells.

Another thing about the Mysore Palace, is they don’t let you take any cameras or phones into the palace itself, as well, you have to take off your shoes. They allow you to take as many pictures as you want around the grounds, so Pradeep gave us some time to that.

Upon entering, I don’t think I have seen a much more beautiful palace in all the world. The murals that adorned the walls were painted in a 3-D technique, which was partly cool and partly freaking. The main room has
2013-07-17 09.13.48
such intricate designs in turquoise and other precious metals. There was furniture made out of silver and crystal. Doors with ivory inlaid in them. Various beautiful murals in every all. Marble steps, like the marble at the Tajo Mahan. Honestly, words cannot express everything, nor begin to give the reader and idea of what the palace is truly like. I guess that means you’ll have to experience it for yourself! After we left the palace, we were greeted by the street vendors. I actually saw a cool wooden car I thought Mark would like so I spent some time bargaining for it, and then noticed a little jewelry box and I bartered for that as well. Another man kept following me and wanted to sell me a fan for 500 rupee and since I had already secured my cash away, I told him I would give him whatever was in my pocket – it was only 12 rupee…he kept hassling me and I kept saying 12 rupee…Finally he agree when the bus was pulling away, but Pradeep said that was such a poor offer, he wouldn’t let me go through with it. Everyone had a good laugh at that!
2013-07-17 09.14.33

After we were done touring, we were given the opportunity to purchase SOME postcards that had pictures from the various rooms. But not many…We collected our shoes, cameras, and phones and were off to Metropole for lunch.

Metropole is clearly another high end resort, which state of the art Indian cuisine. The food was AMAZING! I ventured out and tried a little bit of everything and was glad I did. However, there wasn’t enough room at the table so I had to eat quickly!!!!

After lunch, we were off to a rural village outside of Mysore to see where the Selco solar panels are installed. This particular village worked with an NGO (I’m pretty sure, though, it was the Catholic church as the ladies who greeted us were all nuns and the picture in their buildings were all Catholic murals). They have a couple of buildings that are used for school children to study and are a part of a program called Light for Education. Basically the students each get to borrow a solar powered light every night. The lamp holds light for about four hours, so they can study at home. Every day they need to return
2013-07-17 09.14.44
to the “school” where they are provided a free meal, and more time to study with tutors. While at the school studying, their solar lamps get charged so at the end of their session they can take them home with them. Pretty neat system worked out.

In the village we were also have to enter the homes of three families that have purchased Selco solar systems to light their homes (or huts, these were more like huts). The families were very generous allowing us to enter and see the operation and how these panels make a difference in their daily lives. A truly humbling experience, as something we take for granted, light, is not always readily available.

ON the way home, we stopped at a roadside oasis for dinner – KFC, I wasn’t really hungry (I had a HUGE lunch), so I checked out the little emporium and got myself a little key chain tray. We were back on the bus again and made it home around midnight. I think we all went to bed.

The day of the residency brought more company visits and more experiences. We had breakfast as usual and boarded the bus. Pradeep, our tour guide, provided a lot of insight on the city as we were passing through in the mid-morning traffic jam.

The first company we went to visit was Selco-India. Selco is a solar panel distribution and service company that helps to bring light to the rural poor. Lots of people in the rural areas of India are without power. And those with power in the rural areas may not have the electricity from the grip. The goal is to provide energy to the rural poor. Selco offers an abundant of aftermarket services and they often will provide service to competitor’s panels as well, as often the after sales service is something that goes forgotten.

The company began in 1995, the products they sell have a 25 year warranty on them and they are expensive. Most of the people live on less than 3,000 Rupees ($50) a month and each product costs about 420 Rupees – often a bigger expense than people can afford in one go. Couple that with the difficult banking structure in India and
2013-07-16 11.59.24
it poses a real threat to getting light to the rural poor. A service that Selco offer is financial counseling. They assist people with taking about a loan and filling out the paperwork – essentially Selco helps to establish a poor person’s relationship with a bank and a credit history, which is crucial for future investments and purchases. The way Selco is able to do this is by recruiting retired loan officers to donate their time and knowledge of the industry. In this regard, Selco is not the creditor or backer of the loan, but the networking piece of the puzzle to bring the two factions together. Something important to note, is that the default rate on loans to the poorest of the poor is virtually nonexistent.

After sales support is a big revenue generator for Selco. It also helps to establish trust with the customer, and when the trust builds, the confidence in utilizing solar energy also increases.

The mission of Selco is to remain focused on the rural poor. About 80% of their product line of solar energy is for light and the other 20% is for heating. In the past they have tried to develop
Photo Jul 15, 22 58 02
a reliable cook stove, but it never proved to be very reliable, so that is something they try to stay away from. As far as their market make up, 75% of the market is the rural poor or the handicraft makers and the other 25% are some rural institutions (think NGOs). Selco prefers NOT to serve the institutions, but understands, in some regions this is the best way to enter into a rural area that have virtually been left untapped before. When a cash paying customer comes to Selco, they will in turn service them, but that customer is not given priority in the business model’s current state. Another reason to remain focused on the rural poor is to help these people who are completely left out of the economy, enter into the economy with a positive credit history – it goes beyond just providing light for Selco.

When it comes to Marketing and Sales, there is a small budget and the majority of the marketing is done informally. Occasionally, there will be news coverage of what Selco is doing and they try to capitalize on that as best they can.

The next place we go to visit
Photo Jul 16, 4 51 48
was 3M India. The building we were in was the R&D building for 3M India. Very odd experience for me because 3M – Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, was essentially founded in my backyard and I had never been there. Now, here I am, half a world away and getting to see something that sprung up from my hometown. Another thing odd about the experience is I know people who work at R&D in St. Paul, MN and their locations are TOP Secret – even their spouses cannot know where they work, nor their product lines, so to be at the R&D center of 3M India was a very contradictory feeling for me.

The HR team was our first main contacts and they provided a little bit of back ground on the company and the high regard 3m places on innovation. They talked about the Littman Stethoscope, Post its, Scotch Tape, etc. Investment into R&D is HUGE at 3M. Another thing that is big with 3M is mix and matching technologies to create new uses. Take something learned from Posits, alter it slightly with Scotch Tape and now there is a completely new product and new opportunity to exploit. Something to
Photo Jul 16, 0 41 29
clarify about my experience, is this location only works on R&D for the Indian market only – products seen there might not be seen in the US or elsewhere in the world. One such product was the 3M Car Care shops that help to service the vehicles on the road. The was something very different, but at the same time, I totally think it could work in other markets.

The vision of 3M is in alignment with its foundation and there is a thriving environment of cultural innovation. There are also some things called Customer Technical Centers which have over 60K products that customers can give direct feedback to 3M on. At 3M, the individual initiative is crucial to the success of the employee, and the company. Personal ability to be independent and the ability to thrive in ambiguity are two characteristics 3M looks for in hiring.

Research is the transformation of money into knowledge and innovation is the transformation of knowledge into money. Within 3M there is a mantra of the 3-touch rule. If an employee comes to a problem, they should be able to find a solution after contacting three people in the ENTIRE Company. To
2013-07-16 14.05.31
me, this is an unspoken way of saying communication is key to 3M’s success. An often time in the corporate world people like withhold information and not communicate living by the mantra of knowledge is power and he with the knowledge has the power. My inference from the visit at the 3M-India is that is defiantly NOT the case.

Another part of the core of the 3M is crossfuncitonal teams. The business will prioritize projects based upon resources and money, and it is up to the teams to manage the expectations of the business and the customer. Another part of this is also managing people. People often work on a more than one project at any given time, so prioritizing their work and their projects based upon a balance of customer demand and business priorities. According to 3M this is a fine line to walk and balance, and people can get sensitive if their projects are further developed. Often time’s project will reach a certain point and get killed for one reason or another.

Once our tour was done, we were served lunch. Our lunch that does was Domino’s pizza – but it wasn’t the same flavors that
Photo Jul 16, 0 55 46
we have in the US. Mind you that most Indians are vegetarians, so no meat. There were four different pizzas. The toppings were: Corn, Green Pepper, Eggplant and variety of vegetables with onions. Surprisingly the sauce was pretty much the same.

After we left 3M, we were on our way to Whitefield – a posh area outside the city of Bangalore filled with gated communities and expats. The reason we would be going there was to have dinner with our professor and her family. But, first we had to stop off for a little shopping.

We went to a mall, which by a Minnesotan’s standards was a true mall. All the buildings in one roof with stable stores on the corners. This mall was about four stories high, but wasn’t as big in diameter as say, Mall of America. Another difference was, in order to enter the mall, we all had to go through security, and do the same thing when we exited. There were some familiar stores – ADIAS, but a lot of the stores were different, selling some Western stuff and some Indian stuff. The mall wasn’t very busy, but, it was, after all, a work
2013-07-16 11.29.34
day during working hours. On the fourth floor there was a wine bar – but it wasn’t opened. I am sure if a bunch of us wanted to go in, we could have gotten them to open early, but that was just not the case. The guys were more into a couple of the arcade games.

Outside of the mall was a cricket batting cage, so we all gave it a shot – including me who was wearing a dress that day. I didn’t complete miff every shot; I made contact with the ball a few times. It was sort of fun. Maybe people who are more into baseball would enjoy cricket, but I really don’t. When I was in London my supervisor in Parliament was a HUGE cricket fan. Every day have lunch we had to watch if for about 2-3 hours while we processed paperwork and stuff – such boring sport. And whereas Baseball can go on and on for innings, Cricket can go on and on for DAYS!!!!

After the mall, we made our way to our professor’s home. Actually, it was the home of her sister and her sister’s family, but this is where
2013-07-16 14.33.44
our professor stays when she is in India. They served up some appetizers and coke. Then we were fed a traditional southern Indian meal. This was followed up by some conversation. One of the guys, who are OBSESSED, with motorcycles was given an opportunity to ride a two-wheeler through the streets of the neighborhood (these are not as congested as inner city Bangalore). After some conversation, our professor’s mother blessed each of us and provided us all with a little gift, which was way more than necessary, but we all graciously accepted. We ate pretty late, so it made for a late return back to the hotel.

Global Residency in India

Monday morning was the first day of our residency. The

morning began fairly early with breakfast at the hotel. There was an assortment
of different foods – Western, Indian and everything in between. While I wasn’t
sick, my stomach was beginning to gurgle, so I stuck to a more conservative
breakfast. Although my favorite thing was the papaya. I also had some
watermelon juice and BACON!!!! Seriously! They had BACON! This was probably the
most pleasant surprise one could find in India for breakfast – BACON!!!! Yum!

We all piled into the bus and were off to the first company -

Mytrah.
Mytrah is a wind energy company that has an office in Bangalore, India. They work
off of independence power producer wind farms. Many of the obstacles that
Mytrah faces deals with regulation as the fossil fuel companies have many more
financial resources and can hire many lobbyists. In 2003 India passed an
initiative called the Rules of Electricity Act which was trying to promote the
electricity sector and wind farms, like Mytrah took advantage of this law.

In India, the energy industry is essentially regulated by the

government. There
2013-07-15 09.18.06
is the central government that has regulations that everyone
must abide by and then there are state governments which pass their own
legislation as well.

Another issue that Mytrah faces deals with forecasting. In

order to help better predict and manage wind energy forecasts, Mytrah have
looked to the US, UK and Spain to understand how their models of forecasting
work. Although very difficult to obtain, Mytrah is also looking for legal
solutions to forecasting and scheduling. Wind servers that are used to help
predict usually only obtain the direction, speed and some satellite data
regarding wind energy ups and down.

Furthermore, another obstacle is the tropical climate.

Temperatures are very high and wind is not predictable. This instability in
climate temperature is what makes looking to the West for understanding
difficult. Spain and the UK have very
steady climates. While the US has a variety of climates within the country’s
political borders, the climates are fairly stable within the various
geographical regions.

A possible remedy to the instability of wind energy is to

potentially tap into batteries. However, batteries make not be the best
solution as they can be expensive and have a
2013-07-15 09.18.07
variety of limitations. The Act
from 2003 is very important as the judicial system is very good in India, so
when the laws are not amiable, the judicial route with appeals is a lucrative
option. However, this can be very costly – both in terms of time and money.

Some key take a ways from the meeting with Mytrah was that

the land laws are difficult to lead with in India and not very transparent.
Regulatory knowledge in all areas is imperative to success as well as a great
understanding of the political system with in the country. The best way to
break into the Indian market is through partnerships. Contracts, especially the
way the US deals with contracts, are not a very flexible way to conduct
business. It is important to be flexible and utilize regional strategies as
India is a very diverse nation. Frugal innovation is also important in India.
Finally, one must be patient in India, whether it’s driving down the street or
conducting business – things don’t just happen overnight.

After our meeting, while we were walking out we happened upon

the inauguration of additional office space for Mytrah. There was a
2013-07-15 09.19.37
Hindi priest,
a statue of a god, and, of course, jasmine. There were some prayers that were
said for the prosperity of the company and this location. It was very
interesting to see all the men, and some women, who came to join the
inauguration. After it was over, they passed around some sweets. Boy! Were
those ever sugary – sweeter than sweet and much sweeter than I expected. We
then left the building and made our way back to the hotel where we had lunch as
a group.

After lunch was a lecture by a man who used to work for John

Deere in Pune. I thought his lecture was more insightful and genuine, as he
really wasn’t talking about a particular business, but provided more of a
framework for understanding India – the culture and the way to do business
there. To provide a bit of a historical perspective – India was becoming a
colony of the British Empire when the United States was becoming independent.
Prior to that, India was part of the Mughal Empires – the Hindus were a very
assimilative people, as often their rulers were Muslim and the subjects were
Hindus. In
2013-07-15 11.56.16
some way the British rule was positive for India – Britain brought
railroads, infrastructure, a common language, education, etc. to India.
However, though it was negative in that the British exploited the resources
from India and it created a huge psychological effect on Indians that they were
inferior even in their own country.

Six dimensions are very important to Indian society. They

are: Caste, Class, Language, Religion, Region and Gender. Each of these dimensions
plays a crucial role in the people of India. To understand the people, it is
important to know that people are creative and passionate and this transposes
to the work place as well. It is this passion that drives Indians to work hard;
as well as the PHD effect – Poor, Hungry & Determined. Growth in India is
difficult and when conducting business, that is something to grasp. Much
emphasis is placed on CRM (Customer Relationship Management) – the
understanding that human beings are emotional creatures and being able to
leverage that emotional understanding also becoming important for conducting
business in India. There is a higher purpose to business than just making
money. Some other advice was to leverage India, figure out the growth
2013-07-15 11.57.51
need and
leverage: the market, manufacturing, talent, sourcing and optimize cost – make
sure to group markets on types of markets NOT on region (which is a tendency in
Western business practice).

To conclude, the speaker showed a video about the Aravind Eye Hospital. The clinic was begun

in 1977 with the mission of eliminating avoidable blindness from the world. The
idea was to train doctors to perform basic ocular screenings in a standardized
fashion, thus copying the McDonald’s model of fast and cheap service. At
Aravind, if a person cannot pay, they are not pressured to; however, if they
can pay, they are asked to pay twice to cover someone else’s surgery. The
clinic has grown to be so successful, that many doctors from world renowned
universities (Oxford, Harvard, etc.) send students there to study the practice.
A truly inspiring story of how one person really can make a difference.

After the speaker, we were finally given some time to go

shopping!!! Wa-Hoo!!! We left the hotel as one big group. And made our way past
some nice retail shops and the emporium and some market-type stores (where
bargaining was ok). Eventually, our Program manager began to
2013-07-15 11.58.05
trust some guy who
wanted to bring us to an open market as the sun was beginning to set. My gut
was telling me something was wrong with this, and some of the others must have
felt the same thing, because a bunch of us decided to turn around – we didn’t
want to get lost on our first day in Bangalore.

On our way back, we stopped at the emporium. The emporium is

a government-run marketplace. The prices are set, so no bargaining. The quality
tends to be a little higher, so the prices are higher than those you would find
on the streets. I found some things I really liked, but wasn’t willing to
purchase everything in one night. I made a mental note of what I wanted, so I
knew to save my money – if I did in fact determine it was necessary. For
dinner, we all decided to go to McDonald’s and get a value meal. Most of the meals
are vegetarian, but opted for the Chicken McNuggets – again, I didn’t want to
tempt fate with getting sick eating unfamiliar food. After dinner, the group
split up – about half of us
2013-07-15 13.57.14
went back to the hotel and the other half kept
shopping. Believe it or not, I went back. It was dark and I was getting to feel
very uncomfortable. One of the guys needed to stop at the ATM, so we waited. As
we waiting a beggar with a baby came up to us and kept grabbing at us. I was
pretty persistent about her leaving me alone and she seemed to get the message.
However, none of the guys were as persistent and it made for a very awkward
encounter. IN situations like that, I tend to live by the mantra of be firm,
confidence and say NO, also try to not make eye contact and it usually works
best.

After a crazy filled day, it

was back to the hotel for catching some Zzz’s and starting the process
all over again.

MTU Sign for me
On Sunday morning, I had to wake up at 4 am to finish packing and take a shower and checkout. This time, since I was just flying to Bangalore to meet the group, I packed a bunch of extra stuff that was previously in my carry on into my larger bag. I was nervous it would be too heavy. My driver was early which was a relief! It was still dark out and the drive was quite peaceful. There were no other cars on the road. An occasional truck here and there, but nothing else on the road - very different to see. The driver made good time to the airport. Upon arrival, I had to check in through ‘foreign’ lines. It was sort of nice b/c there weren’t many foreigners. I was then able to get my Boarding pass and according to the airline’s scale my bag was still underweight! Again, at security checkpoint, I was put through to the foreigner lane. I found my gate right away and went to get coffee. When I returned to the gate, they started boarding early.

The flight was pretty empty. I was seated in the emergency exit row which was nice

because I was able to stretch out more. A man from a few rows back moved up and sat on the aisle seat – leaving the middle seat open. We talked and I found out that he was an architect. He is the lead architect who works for Bacardi – designed all the Bacardi lounges located in international airports. The breakfast on the flight was one of the best I had on this trip to date. After breakfast, I took a nap and when I woke up I was in Bangalore.

My first impression of Bangalore was that the airport was one of the nicest I have ever been in. The baggage was sent to the claim right away. I walked out the door and found my driver right away. I had two people – a driver and a navigator. The first thing I noticed was my driver had an extra thumb; I did my best not to stare. Both of the guys were fairly young, early 20’s, but they were very helpful and talkative. The car had some jasmine in it and it is absolutely fragrant. Lots of jasmine garlands and what hot. I noticed a lot of
2013-07-14 10.31.56
Jasmine in the marketplace
Catholic influences. And it turned out the owner of their company was Catholic.

As we were driving into the city they were telling me all about it. About how Bangalore used to be so lovely with lots of gardens, but urban sprawl has set in. Another thing we discussed were weddings, given mine is just around the corner. The navigator’s sister recently got married and because of their class and caste it was a four day event with around 1200 people. They also talked about the jasmine can be found everywhere. Jasmine is very fragrant flower and Indians will twine it into garland. At the beginning of a marriage, a husband will often bring jasmine for his wife to wear in her hair. Some other things they showed me were where the gardens used to be and some of the good places to shop – not that I would get there, but it was nice of them. Finally, we arrived at the hotel. The traffic was heavy and congested by American standards, but was fairly light compared to New Delhi.



When I arrived at the hotel, I had to go through security, and checked in. The
2013-07-14 10.47.35
service was really impressive – they didn’t let me lift a finger. My room was 305 and I was rooming with the other female in the program. In order to get to our room, we had to put our room key in the reader on the lift - which would only let me go to the third floor. My roommate had arrived with the rest of the group around 2 am in in the morning, so she was already in the room. We were all getting ready to meet our driver and guide and to explore the city. We had our lunch at the hotel before we left.

When it was time to go, we all shuffled on to the coach bus which had been provided to us as a part of our program in India. We met our guide – Pradeep, our driver – Edward, and then we also had a navigator. Pradeep had a colorful personality and was full of historical knowledge, linguistic knowledge, religious knowledge, etc. Our first stop was the Botanical Gardens, which were originally set up by the British. It was nice having the guide because then all the beggars left us alone. The
2013-07-14 19.01.31
walk through the gardens was delightful. We saw a lot of different vegetation and beautiful flowers.

We got on the bus, and drove to another part of the city. There we walked through a little marketplace with lots of colors from the fruit stands and the flower stands. Everything was very bright and colorful.

We came to another park and then were led to a Bull Temple. It was very interesting to see, but even though the guide explained the significance of it, I still didn’t understand much of the significance. After we left the temple, we stumbled upon some street vendors. Some of the people were brave enough to try to drink the coconut milk. I decided to get some earrings and a little souvenir for a friend. Our next stop was at the remains of a palace that stood in the city. We did some more sightseeing from the bus – definitely could see all the massive amounts of humanity 😉 ! After a few hours we were headed back to our hotel. Our dinner was just down the road from our hotel. It was a traditional style Indian restaurant. LOTS of good food and good
2013-07-14 11.03.59
wine. It was a nice kick start to our residency. After dinner, we walked back to the hotel and got ready for the week. It was nice to have a shower.

orange county, coorg
My first ever trip to Bangalore and to South India was in the year 2006 for an induction programme with the multinational organisation i had joined. I do recall the HAL airport and that it was small and not being able to cope with the pressure of Bangalore having emerged as the Silicon valley of India. We left for the training facility and it was part of a sprawling over 100 acre property where the corporate office used to be. I remember the weather to be cold and raining, this was in November and I had dinner and called it a day. I was sharing my room with another manager and she arrived in the middle of the night and scared me out of my wits. The next day our induction began and I think we may have been there for a few days, 3 nights at the most. One of the evenings with my new found friend and a few others we caught auto rickshaws and left for MG Road, a long winding ride through narrow heavily clogged roads with traffic and construction to reach after almost an hour or so. We dined on burgers from a fast food joint
bylakuppe
and met up with my brother's friend there. We caught auto rickshaws back and this time it was a bit better. Later I got to know that we were staying at Brookefield near Whitefield and it was a different part of the town from MG Road. One of the evenings we dined at an Andhra joint nearby, all of us sharing the meal. We explored the lobby of the erstwhile corporate office and besides being grand and resembling a lobby of a palace it had this gigantic Hussain painting strapped to the wall. The last day group photographs were taken and it was time to come back.

The next trip was with our own division and we were driving down to Coorg for a conference cum outbound. I still remember the flight from Mumbai being very scary, our entire team was on it and we met winds of crazy speeds while trying to land at the airport. Unfortunately we were not able to land and the winds pushed us off the runway and we had to come around for another landing. Needless to say everyone on board was scared but the second time round we managed to land. I was at this point of time based out of the guest house in Mumbai and hence was on the flight originating in Mumbai. We arrived in Bangalore and I remember meeting up with the rest of the team at a dinner somewhere from where we left for our guest house in Indiranagar. It was a lovely guest house and I had one of the terrace rooms with a lovely open terrace with it.

The next day early morning we left for Coorg stopping at Kamats for breakfast. There is a quaint store in Kamats from where I picked up wooden bangles and we left for Coorg. On the way we worked on our presentations and after a round of nerve wracking presentations and head bashing sales analysis we decided to get some sightseeing done. We were staying at the Orange County and had a lovely villa all to ourselves with a pool at the back. In the evening we explored the grounds a bit and watched the Kodavu tribal dance. The buffet lunches and dinners were lavish and extensive. The next day we left for the Dubare elephant camp and saw elephants being bathed by the Cauvery river. We also went to Bylakuppe where there is a Tibetan settlement. I bought a mobile accessory for myself and my colleague in the Kolkata office and then it was time to drive back to Bangalore.

I was staying back for one more day before which I would leave for Mumbai with rest of the team. One of my assignments was to connect with a leading fashion person in the city and I did so before leaving for Mumbai. At Coorg I also picked up a leather pouch from the store at Orange County.

The next time we were in Bangalore we had an event to organise and it's a different story that the event went out of hand, tempers flared, last moment damage control had to be exercised and somehow we salvaged the situation and the many egos involved. One of the days I dated someone and we dined at Little Italy at Indiranagar and on another day met the same friend and had dinner at 100 Ft road, a Boutique restaurant. After the event at the poolside of the Park, we met up at this exotic restaurant in Indiranagar for a fashion show and it was heartbreaking for me to see the same celebrity organise a far more eclectic event. From here we left for Chennai for the second leg of the journey where unfortunately tempers flared again and all in all I have such mixed feelings of this event.

My last trip to Bangalore would be sometime in the middle of 2007,this time with another event. We had a tough time organising the event at Garuda Mall and altercations with the management occurred before we could proceed again. Luckily for me this time it wasn't my fault at all. It was my boss'. We had a team lunch at a restaurant at Garuda Mall, I shopped a bit at the Home Stop and at Garuda Mall and we stayed over at my colleague's place at Richmond Road. The next morning i left for Kolkata, I had managed to convince my bosses to let me go back to Kolkata again and develop the market there. Still remember the shot glasses and Dunhill deo I picked up for my brothers. The store at Homestop was amazing, it was massive and had this classy and elegant collection of home items. After moving to Bangalore it was here that I would spend so many happy hours. Every time I entered the Garuda Mall it would remind me of the day the mall management fought with us and disconnected our electric connection. Over the years that memory too has dimmed and paled. I also visited the Nallis shop, then on MG Road with the area manager from South and chose this lovely green South Indian saree for my mum. The company owned salon was on Richmond Road and that would be our base. We would walk down once for lunch at a Chinese restaurant and I would be amazed at the cosmopolitan nature of the city and some lovely salons, very high end. In those days we didn't have the new airport and neither did we have the UB City all of which have added to the style quotient of the city. My boss wanted to shop at Forum Mall and I remember going there once and finding it very crowded. After moving here all these places would be my haunt and how happy I would be being the mall rat that I am.

So I pestered and pestered my hubby for a quick break before my medicals begin again. Yes I am in the middle of some medical complications but enough of that. Hubby has booked a deluxe room at the Taj Madikeri, Coorg and am so excited. Watch this space for more!!

What to have for dinner is a question which always leaves you in trouble. And dealing with such questions is quiet difficult. And in such situations agreeing of everyone is important!!

And weekend it was; my parents, my brother, my sister and I were sitting together and playing cards. We all were having a great time as the game was becoming interesting, when out of nowhere I just recommended that we can go to Chokhi Dhani today. With least interest in what I said everybody said “Okay” because everybody’s attention seeker at that point of time was that card game. But our Chokhi Dhani plan was executed also.

So we all went to Chokhi Dhani. It was quiet far from our house but drive was fun indeed. We finally reached the place – and the food turned out to be awesome. The food of Chokhi Dhani which we always use to talk about which is very famous in Jaipur maintained the same standard and taste in Bangalore also.

Now you must be thinking that how costly could this Chokhi Dhani could be? Not at all costly guys, they have very nominal charges in which you get not only food but get to see really nice dances and activities.

P1080143
Days 221 - 225 (Tues 16th – Sat 20thApril) Bangalore



A very early start for me being around 7am to give me time to get showered and to the station in Chennai to head onwards to Bangalore. The trip took around 6 hours and it’s safe to say that the second class seating is not comfortable at all. It certainly isn’t as good as a virgin voyager service back home.

I arrived mid afternoon and got into a taxi and headed out to my guesthouse. Obviously being the way here the taxi driver took me saying he knew where it was when he didn’t. After a phone call to the guesthouse I waited for a couple of minutes with the taxi driver and a bloke on a motorbike turned up to take me to the right place.

After waiting 10 minutes for someone to attend the reception, if you can call it that I got my room. In the evening I headed into town and towards the cricket ground, around 4km from the guesthouse. Luckily Bangalore is nowhere near as hot as Chennai was yesterday so it’s far more manageable. After stopping in a local place
P1080145
for some food I got to the ground to be told there was no ticket office open and it was sold out. I walked around for 30 minutes or so asking all sorts of people about tickets. When I thought I wasn’t going to get in I was approached by a man with a ticket selling for face value. I felt this was a bit sketchy so I agreed to pay on being let in which I did. The game was great, produced a super over to end it and was well worth the 1200 rupees I paid.

I had a strange experience on the way home. I was maybe ¾ of the way back when a scooter pulled along side of me, this now being 12:30am and stopped. The guy started talking to me asking where I was from, why I was here and where I was staying, I answered the first 2 but definitely not the last one. Then I was asked if I wanted his company for the night. After laughing and telling him to do one I carried on my way back to my guesthouse. I’ve plenty of girls offered to me in various cities
P1080148
from China, Philippines and Thailand etc but I’ve never had a man offer his services. I think the fact I started laughing showed I was not interested and he left pretty sharpish.

Wednesday, Thursday and Friday followed pretty much the same routine. Every morning I headed into town to the cricket ground. First day the tickets were not on sale, the second day they were but were very pricey so I left it and thought I could buy online instead. The third day I realised I couldn’t buy online and had to purchase from the ticket office, paying 3300, way more than I’d planned or wanted to pay but at the end of the day I am in India for the IPL so I accepted it and paid it.

The afternoons of these days I pretty much wandered the streets, with no plan in mind to hopefully find something to do or things to see. There is not much to do, that would take up time but there are plenty of impressive buildings in the city. The main things online to do are a water park and snow centre which don’t interest me at all. I spent my
P1080149
evenings eating in the local curry houses and watching the IPL on the tv in my room. Without a tv in my room I may have been a little lost as Bangalore hasn’t a nightlife.

I did get to the stage where I was struggling with the bathroom situation. There was no toilet roll in Bangalore it seemed. As I was running very very short and was out walking one day a great idea crossed my mind. I walked past a pharmacy and saw nappies so figured they’d sell baby wipes. Luckily they did. I did however look a bit of a plank walking through the city centre where I was getting stared at any ways, but this time with a large pink bag of baby wipes. I imagine they all knew exactly what it was for.

Whilst I was in Bangalore on I think the Wednesday there was a terrorist bomb planted which exploded and injured some 16 people. This happened a couple kilometres from my accommodation and you could sort of tell the city was a little bit cautious after that. Luckily they didn’t postpone the cricket on the Saturday night which they were considering.
P1080156

On Saturday I got all my stuff packed and ready to go then headed into town for food followed by the cricket. I needn’t have bothered with the food as I was in a corporate stand and food was served between innings. I gave it a swerve as I was still stuffed and instead had my 2 free Kingfisher’s instead, the first time I’d seen alcohol in India, 5 days in!! It never takes this long in a country. There were no dodgy encounters on my way home this evening so that made the walk home far more straightforward.



Days 226 - 230 (Sun 21st – Thurs 25th April) Chennai



This morning I headed back to Chennai, I wasn’t looking forward to the trip as I didn’t enjoy the 6 hours on the way here, but it turned out not to be to bad. I had the usual fun and games when I arrived in Chennai around 2pm. Flocks of taxi and auto-rickshaw drivers asking me where I wanted to go etc. I got one sorted, showed him the address on my ipod and we proceeded to not be able to find it as
P1080157
commonly practised here. It turns out my hotel was on a little side street of a 23km long road so lucky to find it.

The rickshaw driver decided to help himself to 50 rupees more than we’d agreed. Ok it’s only like 60 pence sterling but he wouldn’t give me the arranged price as we had to drive around the block 3 times. I tried to tell him that at the station he said he knew where it was. He was having none of it. He even came into the hotel and told the owner that he couldn’t find it. I always manage to pick absolute planks to drive me about. If I had small bills I’d have paid what we agreed but I didn’t so he short changed me. I accepted that I wasn’t getting my correct change and headed in. Dropped all my gear of and walked to the stadium to buy tickets for the 2 games while I am in town this time. 750 rupees which is great compared to Bangalore. In the evening whilst sat in the lobby met a lad called Leo who was also going to the cricket so agreed we’d head there
P1080159
together and hang our during the day.

On Monday and Tuesday I pretty much hanged out with Leo, a lad from the Isle of Wight who’s been in India since early January, on my first impressions that’s far longer than I would like to stay here. We spent most of the 2 days just chilling in either the huge mall just around the corner or relaxing in our hotel rooms watching tv. On Monday night we went to the game. It turned out to be an absolute cracker and one of the best T20 games of the season. Not bad considering it was Leo’s first ever game of any sport. Leo left late on Tuesday so the rest of my time would be spent back on my own.

On Wednesday I decided to do some major walking around town. It was about 36 degrees and very humid but I managed a good 3 hours walking around town before I felt knackered. I wandered to Fort George which is just an army base and not impressive. Also down to the sea front where there is a lot nicer area. I think it was called Anna Square. It’s obviously one
P1080162
of the nicer spots in town as its full of people, still no other tourists though. I’ve hardly seen any white folk in my 2 weeks or so here, it’s a bit off putting as locals just stare permanently at me. It seems a lot easier place to be when you have company. It doesn’t seem to bother me as much when the stares are aimed at 2 people as opposed to 1. I thought India would be a bit more used to white people than it seems. I got less stares in China.

Thursday I just enjoyed that I had probably the nicest room I’ve had in a while and lay in bed until early afternoon when I went to the cinema to watch Oblivion, Tom Cruise’s new film. After being pretty much completely baffled by the storyline I headed out to watch my final match in Chennai. Another home win and top class performance topped of a good few days in Chennai, I feel like I am enjoying India a bit more than I was although I’m still not hugely keen on it, there just doesn’t seem a lot to do here which is a shame considering
P1080166
I’ve been in 2 cities that have 8 and 9 million people in them. Plus the heat and more importantly humidity are killing me any time I go outside. I struggle in a Manx summer let alone and Indian one.

Delicious treats at Hastakalaa Market
Yes, I'm still in Bangalore, enjoying a lazy life and good company, however, that is all about to change as I prepare to go it alone in India. I finally pulled my finger out and started planning a rough itinerary, although I've only pin-pointed and booked one destination so far. It's a start. I'll figure the rest out as I'm going along.

In the last few days, I've experienced more amazing food, but also what I'm assuming to be meat withdrawal. For two days I was devoid of all energy and unbelievably sleepy. I wasn't consciously craving meat, but my body clearly was.

On Friday, I chilled at Big Straw (Vidya and Ashish's bubble tea cafe), and sampled various fruit lattes with aloe vera chunks, mango stars (awesome!) and mango bombs. They knock the socks off Korea's bubble teas, I can tell you! Later, Veena, Indu and I went to a local craft market, where I went a little OTT on the accessories buying. Most of you know how extensive my accessory collection is, and given the limited space left in my backpack, I should've known better, but still. In the evening, we went to the cinema and watched
My money was just begging to be spent....
'Lessons in Forgetting'. It was very good and I totally recommend it, but be warned: it's a very dark and depressing film and you won't shake off the harsh reality of it easily.

On Saturday, Indu took me out to buy a kurta (tunic) to wear to the kooth party that evening. I ended up buying three. As you do. I also had my hair trimmed and facial hair threaded (yes, I've reached that undignified age where facial hair starts sprouting and I can't even muster up the shame not to mention it). Then, in the evening, we went to a kooth party. My two left feet and I just kicked back and watched as other clubbers threw shapes on the dance floor. As is usually the case when surrounded by people with rhythm, I questioned why I wasn't blessed with such talent.

Sunday was another chill day, then we headed to Ashish's place for the night. We woke up the next morning and spent a few hours in the pool, which was lovely and relaxing. In the evening, we came back to Benson and ordered Chinese and ice cream. The 'Death by Chocolate' (recommended by Indu!) option
In my new kurta
wasn't lying; having eaten it all in one sitting, I actually felt as though I was dying, but it was worth it.

Today, I sat waiting for my onward bus tickets to be delivered, with the intention of heading straight out to Big Straw for my fix of bubble tea, but now I'm vegged out listening to the buzzing and rumbling of passing vehicles, with Freebie (the Benson family cat) purring away on my legs. It'd be a such a shame to disturb her....

Bangalore
view from a rooftop restaurant
Hey again,

So....I made it to India in one piece. Erica and I spent the last night in Amsterdam with our two friends and got on the plane at 5 am the next day. We met up with Robyn, another girl in our program, in Paris, where we met at the gate for our flight to Bangalore. Everything went fine until Paris, where we were stuck on the tarmack for three hours because of technical difficulties with the plane. Not an encouraging thing to happen just before a 9 hour flight. However, we landed in Bangalore safely, and spent the night at a family owned hotel near the airport.

Now, this is where the networking began. We talked with the wife of the hotel owner in the morning and she had connections in the city which is an hour from the airport area. She arranged for her friend George who was a friend of a friend who knew somebody who had a membership at the catholic club which was basically like a YMCA with a pool and cheap food. Very safe. Perfect. So, we shacked up there for 4 nights and the next day slept in til 1 pm!!!
Sultans Burial Place
near Mysore
Talk about jet lag. We then spent the afternoon finishing our final papers and hanging out near the pool. Hard life I know. Then we bought traditional Indian dresses called salwar kameez and wore them to dinner to celebrate the end of another semester.

The heat here is insanely hot. I just came from - 1 degrees celsius in Amsterdam and it is literally 40 degrees in Bangalore with the humidity. My poor Scottish, Danish ancestry has given me the weakest capacity to deal with heat of this kind.

The next day we hired a taxi driver to take us to Mysore, my old stomping grounds, where I lived at the age of thirteen and my whole journey towards working in Global Health began. We visited the palace, the Chamundi hills, ate masala dosa and butter chicken at my old time favorite restaurant, which has since been renovated, but which still exists!! We then visited a few temples and shrines dedicated to dead sultans, and made our way back to Bangalore, stopping only for coconuts and chikoo (small brown fruit that tastes like a mix between a prune and a pear) along the side of the road. We
Palace
Mysore
arrived in Bangalore just in time for rush hour traffic which meant we were stuck in hot, dusty, loud traffic for about 2 hours longer than we should have been. After a long day, we passed out almost immediately when we got back.

From Bangalore we headed to Kerala by plane, to a place called Cochi, which is a little fishing village on the outskirts of brackish water canals that loop in and out of floating villages. They call it the Venice of India: I would argue that it is even more beautiful than Venice, having been there myself a few years ago. I came to Kerala with my mom when I was thirteen, and I have to say, although there is much more development than there used to be, I felt very nostalgic as I walked along the fishing shore and saw the very familiar chinese fishing nets, and the fisherman selling all types of fish and seafood. The three of us bought fish and prawns, and a local restaurant cooked it for us in garlic and butter. Cheap as chips, as they say. And delicious it was!!

Next, we got sarees made (another traditional Indian dress) made of Keralan silk, and we ventured over to a cultural center where we saw traditional Kathakali dancing, which is basically theater dance with large, heavy intricate costumes, and detailed eye movements which convey emotion, rather than actual acting. It is a very cool thing to see, and I would recommend seeing it if you can.

Next we made our way to an elephant sanctuary where we made friends with a baby elephant and watched elephants bathing in the water. Very cool. The rest of our time was spent on the backwaters exploring small villages and taking in the view from the water of the women on shore making string out of coconut husks, which, unlike the way it used to be when I was here ten years ago, is supplemented by the government, which gives these women machines which helps to increase the production of string.

Kerala was probably the hottest place we went to. After about a week in Karnataka state and then Kerala, we ventured to Goa, where we ended up staying for five days. Palolem beach is my favorite beach in India, aside from a place called Gokarna. I was afraid that it would have been ruined by tourism in the last ten years, and although again, there was much more development that before, it is off-season for tourists, so the beach was not busy, and it was JUST as I remembered it. I was home again in some small way, which may sounds weird, but makes perfect sense to me. I think my mom and brother would understand what I mean...

After two weeks of traveling for pleasure, balancing headphone parties and fire dancing/poy on the beach with trying to find internet occasionally to let people know we were alive or finish final papers and assignments, we arrived in Manipal. We are staying in an all girls residence which is very clean and safe, although we have a curfew, and I feel like I am 5 years old again. I guess the university used to have problems with alcohol, drugs, and public displays of affection, so they have really cracked down and made things a lot more conservative around here. I will be here for two weeks working with students from all over the world, and I will start fieldwork at an ART center (anti-retroviral treatment) at the state hospital in Udupi district. I will work with HIV positive patients and health workers to investigate issues associated with the side effects of taking anti-retroviral drugs. I am so excited to have this practical experience, and I cant wait to report on how it goes. I will report back when I can. I can’t believe I only have two weeks left before I am back in Canada! Talk to you soon,

Our second placement weekend was spent in the beautiful city of Mysore, (mistakenly pronounced by Ali as ‘Mee-sore’ much to the amusement of our Indian housemates) a three hour bus ride away from Ashwini. We stayed in a hotel 3km outside the centre claimed by the Lonely Planet as ‘the nicest hostel in all of India’. Not convinced by this statement but if nothing else it definitely has a shot at being the most hilarious. We were staying in the women’s dorm which contained about 20 bunk-beds and at least another 20 mattresses strewn on any available floor surface. The other guests were exclusively Indian, my particular bunk-mate made her irritation at our presence very clearly known-after enquiring of me suspiciously several times ‘why are you here?’, she tried to oust Ali and I to the other side of the room and then insisted Ali move her rucksack as it was in, I quote, ‘the place for my soap’. I also got a very stern yelling for rolling over in the night. The bathrooms are also an adventure as queuing is not a concept which India has adopted. In fact the exact opposite. The shower etiquette goes as follows: barge in when you can and if someone dares to take more than 5 minutes, attempt to knock the door down. Is an interesting approach. The sign stating check-in is from ‘10am to 10am’ (just below the sign that bans ‘all gambling and playing cards’) is clearly not a strict rule as a literal bus-load of women rolled into the room at 6am and, mid full-blast singing, threw a bag onto Cat’s head thinking her bed was empty. One way to start the day!



We found an excellent local restaurant which we quickly made our regular lunch venue-highlight was a HUGE thali for the grand price of 80p including curry, poppadum, family sized portion of rice, various non-descript but fantastic sauces and poori, a kind of puffed up bread which is delicious. The food situation only got better as we decided to splash out for our Saturday dinner and go to a beautiful hotel for an afternoon and evening of fruit platters, masala peanuts, cocktails and (for me) pasta in their courtyard, candle-lit restaurant. I visited the toilets approximately 55 times to make full use of the toilet roll. Speaking of toilets we also found a mall in the middle of Mysore which is half built (health and safety not on the radar) but very much open and contained, much to our delight, air-conditioning, the most impressive selection of ice-cream flavours I have ever seen, escalators and, the crowning glory, a set of loos with not only toilet roll but soap dispensers and an actual hand drier. You have never seen 6 people so excited. So much so that we visited again on the Sunday. In my haste I managed to fall over the doorway and slice my toe at which point the very lovely security man leapt at the opportunity to christen his first aid kit and doused my wound with not one, not two, not three, but FOUR types of antiseptic. It is still the cleanest wound in the history of time.

The palace is one of the most impressive buildings I have ever seen from stunning green-pillared wedding room (dad-get saving I have found my future marriage venue) to very British-style stained glass windowed courtyards. We returned in the evening for the promised light spectacular display of the 42000 bulbs lining the palace. After a few tepid flashes we gave up and went to drink some beer instead. Equally cultural. On the Sunday morning we got a bus to Chamundi Hill to visit the temple which at first read I am sure sounds incredibly serene. Think again. The temple itself is a beautiful white building perched on top of a hill with an incredible view of Mysore. However the rest of India decided they also wanted to witness its beauty on the same day. There was a queue (which actually seemed to function as a queue) looping round the entire building. We naturally had to pay the 3x increased foreigner price which did mean that we got fast tracked through the throngs straight into the temple, past the ‘coconut breaking place’, into the Goddess chamber where you are instructed to stick your hand in fire and drink holy water which looked so dubious we threw it on our heads instead. And then 30 seconds later we were out! And into the market next to the temple which includes the most bizarre selection of toys you could possibly imagine. Am still baffled by the thought process that went into making some of these things:

‘OK boss, I have an idea. For our next big seller how about a plastic man with a cone shaped head pushing a plastic cart full of tiny white balls’

‘Not bad, let’s make 500 in 10 different colours, but I was thinking more along the lines of a plastic baby in basket called “Titoo”’.

‘Brilliant boss. But I have an even better idea. Take the same plastic baby, surround it by neon pink fluff and make it into a rucksack.’

‘We have a winner’.

We spent what we thought would be our final few Mysore hours in a rooftop café overlooking the palace as a parade drummed away below us punctuated with the occasional cannon boom. No-one seemed too alarmed by this though we did see several birds literally drop out of the tree opposite us. Afterwards we headed to the bus station in plenty of time for our 17:30 bus home. I resist the urge to use the ‘physically challenged toilet’. 17:30 came and went. Turned out our bus had crashed on the way and was cancelled. Ah. After a fun half hour of shoving in the refund ‘queue’ we found out there is another bus at 11.30pm that we were about to book when we realised it wouldn’t arrive until 7am. Ah. Why? Turns out that the forest roads close overnight as this is when the elephants presumably get their rage on so the bus simply stops for a few hours. In the middle of the forest. We quickly vetoed this option and found a hotel near the bus station which for the grand price of £10 a night (we decided it was justified as we had spent £1.20 at the hostel of dreams). We were rewarded by a rooftop pool; lady kit containing essentials such as toothpaste, bindis and tongue scrubber; fan AND air conditioning AND TV, all of which I turned on immediately, just because I could-Harry Potter in Hindi is a fascinating experience; mirror which helpfully asks ‘am I smart’; and the best shower head I have seen in a month. It. Is. Heaven. We reluctantly left the next morning and our 7am bus mercifully appeared. After an hour-long tyre change we are finally on our way. Clearly the little boy in front of us was caught short as his mother dangled him out the window to do his business. Unfortunately we had all the windows open and Ali and Alex received a lovely face-full of toddler pee to finish off our very eventful weekend! As Han (wrongly but very accurately) read from the guide book: ‘If you haven’t been to Mysore, you just haven’t been’.

Dodge the cow
I touched down in Bangalore just before midnight on Monday, and was greeted at arrivals by Veena and her friend, Indu. We took the hour's drive back to V's place and after a short catch-up on the balcony, my tiredness got the better of me and I turned in. For some reason, I'd stayed wide awake for the full four and a half hour flight, which is very unlike me. I usually can't sit still for five minutes without drifting off. I somehow managed to zonk out whilst riding in a Cambodian tuk-tuk for goodness' sake! And those of you that have ridden in Cambodian tuk-tuks will understand how difficult a task that should be.

The next day, we just chilled before heading out late afternoon. We went to Frazer Town and had a coffee at French Loaf, where I was eaten alive by mosquitos and - for the first (and hopefully last) time during my travels - was attacked by a spider. Now, most people know about my paralysing fear of creatures of the arachnid variety, and those who don't, usually experience a mix of amusement and utter shock at my reaction to seeing one. Anyway, I was just
sitting there, minding my own business, when something dropped on my arm. I mindlessly flicked it away, and in doing so, noticed that it was a spider. Unfortunately, my flick had not been strong enough for the eight-legged terrorist, and so strong was its conviction in terrifying the life out of me, that it landed on my leg. I closed my eyes, flapped my hands in the air and incoherently whimpered at Veena, begging her to help me. Bless her cotton socks - she jumped out of her chair and in seconds, had removed the assailant from my person. Once I had calmed my breathing, and recovered from my traumatic experience, she began gently teasing me about how small the spider was. I was in no position to argue with the woman that just saved my life, so I graciously accepted the mockery.

Still reeling from the recent dramatic event, we went in search of food, stopping at a small street stall serving panipuri, which is a common snack in the north of India. It's basically a crispy, hollow pastry ball with a large hole in it, which is then filled with potato, onion, chilli and some seasonings, followed
Watch it, people!
by 'pani' (Hindi for water). This is then served on a banana leaf 'saucer'. Anyway, the idea is to just shove the whole thing in your mouth, lest you dribble the liquid down your chin. No prizes for guessing who made a mess of herself.

Next, we popped across to a sweet shop, selling an array traditional Indian sweets, such as gulab jamoon (small sausage-looking deep-fried dough rolls soaked in sugar water) and raspuri (small, yellow balls, of Bengali origin). I got a little too excited, and proceeded to order half the shop, not even deterred by the power-cut half-way through.

My first observation of Indian roads was that drivers use their horns more than any other function on their cars/autos/mopeds. During peak hours, it's hard to hear yourself think over the constant honking and bibbing, and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads sends my mind into utter confusion. I didn't know which way to look, let alone where to cross. It has to be said, however, that drivers are quite skilled when it comes to dodging crossing pedestrians and Sunday-strolling cattle.

And that brings me to observation number two: cows. Throughout the day, I
Random monkeys
They looked at me rather aggressively, so I ran like the wind after taking this photo!
saw numerous cows just wandering the streets, some down the middle of the roads (causing vehicles to divert around them), some taking the civilised pavement route, and some just chilling by the road-side. The bizarre thing is, they are just as oblivious to the honking horns and bustling traffic as the drivers are to the sight of cattle strolling in their paths. One cow was even chewing away on a crash helmet that had been left on a moped outside a shop! You see, cows are seen as sacred in Hindu society, and one of the reasons for this is that the god of revenge, Shiva, rode one through Heaven. Likewise, monkeys are not killed due to their association with the god Hanuman.

In the evening, Veena's housemate Vidya and their friend Ashish picked us up and we briefly swung by a poetry reading at Urban Solace, before satisfying our hungers at Queen's - a Punjabi restaurant on Church Street. We ordered a variety of dishes, including palak paneer (spinach and cottage cheese), mushroom masala (self-explanatory) and malai kofta (veggie balls). Wow! The meal was amazing, so much so that the lack of meat didn't even register in my mind. With food like that, I could easily be vegetarian.

At some point during our walk to Frazer Town, Veena asked me how I feel about the attention I get in public. No, not the sort of looks that Julia Roberts got when she donned the red dress and strutted through the hotel lobby in Pretty Woman; the ""oh look, a foreigner!"" look. Until she mentioned it, I hadn't even realised I was drawing attention, to be honest. I grew so accustomed to being stared at in Korea, I'm oblivious to it now. Perhaps this can be considered in a positive light, in that I feel no form of self-consciousness, but in terms of 'keeping my wits about me'? Not so much.

Wednesday and today were basically chill days, interspersed by periods of eating and my own private showing of the movie Veena directed, 'Reminiscence of Ether'. I was blown away. Such a lovely story line. I listened in awe as Veena told me 'behind the scenes' anecdotes and the production build-up. I'm also proud to say that I have met everyone involved in the making of this movie. Keep your eyes peeled for these guys, people.

And for the food update: Wednesday's lunch consisted of puri, sagu, dhosa and coconut chutney, and dinner was biryani, egg chilli, masala papad and a couple of brandy and cokes at a restaurant called Rewind.

Today, I finally pulled my finger out of my arse and ventured out alone - following very precise instructions from Veena. The aim was to pick up an SD card reader for my iPad from the Apple shop on MG (Mahatma Ghandi) Road since the non-Apple one I bought in Singapore only served to slow down the device's performance. Well, the Apple store doesn't stock them, so I proceeded to Hard Rock Cafe on St Mark's Road, had a couple of iced lattes, then hopped back in an auto to Veena's place in Benson Town.

Veena and I have just been discussing Hindu gods and the stories behind them. I didn't provide such entertaining responsive banter as Pete did back in Cadiz, but i found it just as interesting. Did you know that the Hindu god Ganesh had an elephant head because his father, Shiva, chopped off his original one, not knowing that the man he was decapitating was his own son? Upon discovery of this fact, Shiva duly replaced said head with that of an elephant.

And on that note, I'll bid you goodnight.

How to reach there


The shiva statue is located in the old airport road of Bangalore. If you are going from MG Road side, you have go on the old airport road for about 4kms till you find a shopping complex called “Total Mall” (earlier called Kids Kemp). The Statue is located behind this building, slightly visible to outside. There is an entry at the side of the building, mentioned as “Pahadi Siva dhama Yatra”. You have to mark it from close or you may miss it.


About the temple


The interesting fact of the temple is that it is open in 365 days a year and 24 hours a day. This is something rare for any other temple in India.

Although people feel that the place has been commercialized by selling various types of tickets, you can also go free and have darshan without spending a single rupee. All the tickets are for extraneous activities and not necessary for any common devotee.
Special entry Tickets


There are various types of entries, free entry and special entry. Free entry may have a long queue (as below) and may take about an hour depending on the crowd. Special entry costs 50 rupees to bypass the queue. However, I mostly prefer free entry as it gives me more time to think about God and spend that money on buying other pooja tickets like milk abhishek etc.


The shops at both sides


While standing on a long queue you will come across about hundred shops on both of your side. Shops selling idols of God and other pooja/ religious items. The place may be slightly costlier than other places where they are available cheaper, but you will get a good variety of items here in this place.


Special Pooja tickets


After the queue you will find the ticket counter. This ticket counter is not for fast entry as you have already free entered through the queue. This counter sells ticket for various attractions like:

- Om namah Shivaya Yatra Rs 20/-

- Pahadi Shiva Dhama Yatra Rs 30/-

- Milk abhisek Rs 10/-

- 12 Jyotirling Yatra Rs 10/-

- Paap naash diya Rs 20/-

- Om namah shivaya wish coin Rs 20/-

- Havan Rs 20/-

- Navagraha Rs 10/-

- Vighna haran thread Rs 10/-

- Archana Rs 10/--

Thus total Rs160/- if you buy individual tickets. Alternatively you can buy a special ticket for Rs 100 which includes all the above in a package.
Photography inside the temple


Besides you have to buy camera tickets for Rs 25 and video camera tickets for Rs 100. Earlier till 2008 (?) photography was strictly not allowed. Some people were taking pictures very secretly through mobile cameras. Although I had great wishes to take pictures I never liked taking stealth pictures. But suddenly when I went after a gap that I found that cameras are allowed for a price. I also took a lot of pictures and videos of the beautiful place.
The big statue


After buying special pooja tickets (if you wish so) and camera tickets (again if you need) you are entering to the main compound. Here you can keep your shoes in the shoe stand for Rs 2/- and proceed inside.

Now you can see a giant statue of Ganesh and a giant statue of Shiva, both very beautiful and very attractive. You will soon forget the pain of coming so far to see the place. You will feel eager to go close to the statue and see the statue from different angles.

Most people first visit Ganesh statue then proceed to Shiva statue. You have to climb a few steps (about 30) to reach Ganesh statue and then climb down the same on the other side.


Pahadi Shiva dhama yatra


Pahadi shiva dhama yatra is a special place having Himalayan Shiva statues. As I mentioned earlier, if you have bought special tickets you can enter into this place. Apart from various Shiva Lingas you will find Amarnath, which is made of ice. You can touch the ice Linga and feel it in your hands.


Om namah sivaya yatra


If you have bought tickets for this, you will be given 108 coins. There will be 108 pots. You will chant om namah sivaya and put a coin in each of these pots. This is quite interesting and keeps you busy for atleast 5 minues.


The miracle spot


If you have bought tickets for Om namah Shivaya wish coin, you can wish something at this spot and drop the coin in the water. People believe that their wishes will be fulfilled.


Papa nashini diya


You may buy tickets for getting a candle from this counter and float the candle on the water in front of the statue.


Havan


This is a ticketed activity. You will be given a piece of wood and a small bowl of ghee for havan. You will go to the havan kunda (behind me in the picture below) and put the wood and ghee inside. There will always be fire inside the havan kunda to burn your offerings.


Navagraha


There is a navagraha temple inside the compound as ususal in any other temple in south India. You can have free darshan of Navagraha. But if you have bought a ticket then you will be given a deepa (candle) to pray the lords.


Coming out


Coming out of the temple is fairly simple. As the whole place is an open compound there is nothing much to confuse. You take the exit any time after having darshan. The entry and exit are two different routes. You will find a lot of shops on the exit route too. If you have failed to buy anything while entering, you can buy from here.


At the end


The place is very peaceful. You can sit here for long time. Especially in the evening it is very peaceful to sit here in the courtyard in front of the statue and stare at the statue. People staying close to this area come here regularly for a prayer to the Lord. As I stay far (about 15 kms) which takes one to two hours drive depending on traffic, I come about once in a year.

Shivaratri is a festival day and you have to stand on long queues. Avoid on Shivaratri if you are not a serious devotee. Once in Shivaratri (2006) I stood on the queue in the evening and had darshan of the lord at 2 O’clock after standing for about 8 hours. Reaching home was almost morning.

I have seen some other big Shiva statues, one in Haridwar, one in Gajnur (Karnataka), one in Murudeshwar (Karnataka). I guess Murudeshwar statue is the largest of all. Bangalore statue is probably more homely 😊 (because I stay in Bangalore!).

Steam - the good old days - to Ooty
So next stop after The Andamans are parts of South India, before heading north for a few weeks, and then going to Japan at the end of this month. These are, in fact, “filler” weeks as we were going to do Darjeeling & Sikkim till we discovered that it might be too cold to visit this time of year, and we didn’t wish to carry our warm gear with us as well through the places we have visited since the girls left.

We get a Jet Airways flight from Port Blair to Chennai after a slight hic cup when we realise we don’t have the copy of the e-ticket for C. Thankfully there is a Jet counter at the entrance to the airport & we get a copy free (as she is sooooo nice) - they decide not to charge her the Rs 100 usual fee for dorks who forget such things.

The flight is uneventful other than the surprise lunch on board and the nerdy kid in front of us who couldn’t just talk to his parents but had to shout at an annoying pitch every five seconds - M could quite easily have strangled him. Ipods to
Arjuna's Penance - Mam
the rescue and the squirt lived to see another day.

Chennai

We arrive at the new Chennai airport ½ hour (2.35pm) early which is great and then luckily we bump into a Czech guy (Michael from Prague) who’s also looking to take a pre-paid cab to Mamallapuram. So we share the cost (Rs 1280) and the cab gets us there in an hour and a half. We therefore, avoid the hassle of getting a Metro to the centre, finding the Bus station and then taking a 2 hour bus ride to get there. We also avoid the need to stay in Chennai which isn’t our bag. We were here 5 years ago and it didn’t do it for us then. However, from the air Chennai looks great with the houses all brightly coloured in yellows, pinks, purples, blues etc amid palm tree lined streets.

We’ll be back to catch the train to Ooty in a few days.

Mamallapuram – The World Heritage Site for the Pallava Dynasty carvings & Temple.

The ride to Mamallapuram is slow going for a while then the freeway opens up and we travel along the sea shore for miles. There
C & friend - too early for an ice cream - Mysore
are a host of tourist places here now and large backwater lakes, a few filled with Indian Pink Flamingos – smaller and less pink than the ones in Africa.

We get to the town in bright daylight. We had rung ahead and booked a room at a Hotel (we thought was a family Guest House) called Le Vie en Rose. Odd name for a place here – but then so are most of the places in what the LP guide rightly refers to as “Backpackistan”! The hotel is fine – only Rs 600 per night – wow. It’s also near the Bus stop and at the center of the action here.

One thing we discover early on is that M’s Hindi isn't going to be much help – most locals only speak Tamil and some English. So English it is - as his Tamil is pretty non-existent despite the fact he spent 3 years in University at Chennai.One point of note in this part of the world/India is that names of people seem to go on forever - see the signs we have taken pictures of.

The place really is a backpacker’s delight and pretty chilled. The
Beach & Shore Temple - Mam
main drag off the town’s High Street (called East Raja Street) is Othadavai Street where most of the eateries and shops are. It leads to the sea where life seems largely the same as it was for the local fishing community many years ago bar the arrivals of the tourists and everything that brings. The fishermen are busy getting on with life, fixing nets, preparing nets for fishing at sunset, fixing boats, playing cards till fishing time etc. All the while many cows, some dogs and quite a few foreigners walk around them.

The sea front cafes and restaurants are all painted in bright colours as are the fishing boats all along the shore front. The sea looks clean but is more for surfers than swimmers. At the shore, resplendent at sea level is one of the famous temples – called quite originally – Shore Temple!! There’s a movie or TV crew working nearby.

Looking around we can only imagine that this is akin to Hampi, which many travellers have said is really lovely and laid back with the usual blend of Indian mysticism, history and picturesque landscape. We do regret the fact that we missed the chance
The Five Rathas - Mam
to go there when we were in Goa (we didn't realise we were so close to it; about 180 kms). However, we can always add this into our next trip to India, together with Dharamsala & Manali which we discounted in favour of Leh, Srinagar & Sikkim when we get back in June.

We find a really small book shop and discover that they are selling the new LP India Guide – second hand for Rs 500 – bargain and we are back in business.

After all the seafood in the Andamans we are ready for some good south Indian food – Dosa’s, Idli, Uttappam etc. But amazingly most places are labelled North Indian or tourist joints – we have to search out the two places that do what we want - Anand Bhavan & Mamalla Bhavan. Mamalla is the better of the two and we eat there quite often – awesome breakfasts and dinners and very cheap. It’s a bit of a local institution with staff that seem to have been there since the day it opened – the guy who serves us is really sweet and attentive. We also take Michael (the Czech version!) there one
Big sculptures - Mam
breakfast - as he’s a keen foodie with an ambition to open his own eatery back in Prague - so he can experience Pongal (a sort of rice, lentil and spice mix that’s yummier than it sounds!) and all the other delights and their excellent Madras coffee.

We do try seafood one night at Ponn Water Face – Kalamari & seafood noodles – ok, but not as good as the Andamans. We only went there really for the “cheap” beer (at Rs 180 it isn’t cheap at all but there’s no bottle shop nearby so needs must!).

Internet here is great value at Rs 30 per hour and really fast so we catch up with family & friends and spend a happy two hours uploading our last three blogs.

We have come here to see the temples and rock carvings from the 7th Century, during the Pallava Dynasty, which now have UNESCO World Heritage status. The 2 separate sites have to be paid for – The Five Rathas and the Shore Temple. In all honesty, unless you want to get close to the carvings to see them in detail, it’s not worth paying. You can see the
Steam Train to Ooty
Five Rathas quite easily from the road and the Shore Temple from the beach. M is definitely not convinced that the sites warrant World Heritage status and in terms of value for money for the RS 250 fee – it only warrants about Rs 50 compared to other World Heritage sites we have seen in India.

At one of the Temples in town (Talasayana Perumal) there is a story that the Shore Temple was built on the spot where Vishnu appeared to a saint who was trying to bail out the sea (!) to present a gift to Vishnu. The Five Rathas (5 temples and a life sized elephant and lion) are apparently carved out of one huge piece of stone and may or may not be dedicated to the five Pandavas and their wife – the heroes of Mahabharata – depending on whether you believe LP or the Archaeological Survey of India respectively!

The rest of the sites are free, and to our eyes, more impressive. Especially the bas relief carvings of Arjuna’s Penance and Trimurthi’s Cave. These are all found in one long stretch of grounds along the edge of town which makes a popular local
Mysore Palace
picnic site (judging by the litter left around!). A local favourite is called Ganesh’s Butter Ball (haven’t a clue why?), a large boulder that sits on a slope precariously which is good for photo’s. We do most of the sites early in the morning and late afternoon when it’s more comfortable as it’s incredibly hot and humid here; we think only Palenque in Mexico was more sweat inducing.

The stone carving craft is still a major feature of the town, with sculpture workshops everywhere and either the gentle noise of stone chiselling or the whirring din of stone cutting machines. There are some pretty impressive pieces which we suspect are bound for businesses as they’d be too large for a home.

Weekends see a lot of local day-trippers on buses, coaches and in their own cars and all the sites are packed with folk (generally all dressed up and the women with garlands in their hair) and the restaurants are full.

We meet up with Michael again one evening for a beer (he’s not sure whether to go to Hampi & other parts of India or go back to The Andamans which he loves). We hope to
Chamundi Hill Mysore
meet up with him when we head to Prague in future. The next day we take the local Express bus to Chennai, where we are to catch our overnight train to Metupalaiyam and (hopefully) the early morning connection with the Mountain Railway steam train up to Ooty. We book our bags into storage at Chennai station for convenience (Rs 45 for 3 bags for one day) but we aren’t inspired to go out and about. M lived here for 3 years as a student and we visited in our last trip and really it’s just a big smelly city. So instead we find a chair in the waiting room upstairs (which is quite big and airy) near a power point and play games and catch up on planning and the blog.

Supper is some awesome kebab rolls from Tibby Frankies in the station – chicken tikka and paneer with mint sauce are best. Then all aboard for overnight the trip to Ooty.

Travellers Tips:

There are only 3 direct buses from Mamallapuram to Central Chennai a day. Rs 39. Then get a local bus from the bus station to Central Railway station Rs 7.

Udagamandalam…….. (Simply
All aboard - Mountain Railway
known as Ooty)

So from the sweltering heat of Mamallapuram, we are sitting in our room in Ooty writing this wrapped in blankets!! It’s cool here.

The overnight journey went well and in fact we arrive into Metupalaiyam 30 mins early; great as it means time for a couple of good hot coffees and lots of photos of the Nilgiri Mountain Railway narrow gauge steam train and steam engines before we set off. Aditya has managed to get us 1st class tickets, one on each side of the carriage so we get the best photo opps of the views all the way up. (Thanks Aditya). The journey takes 5 hours with plenty of stops along the way for refreshments etc. We see quite fresh elephant poo by the tracks but no signs of the real thing. There are also plenty of birds and butterflies and the vegetation changes from palm trees to tea plantations to eucalyptus trees as we go higher.

On some of the steeper sections, the steam train engine really struggles and shudders and on arrival at Coonor after 3 hours, the steam engine is replaced with a diesel engine for the final 2 hour
Brindhavan Gardens - night show
leg to Ooty. More smooth but less atmospheric. (Unfortunately we also change travelling companions at Coonor; some eejit Brits and their guide join us and we soooo want to tell them where to get off for being completely obnoxious & ignorant twits!! The Indian guide wasn’t much better, giving incorrect information. M has to bite his lips, a lot; we guess they deserve each other.)

Anyhow, the train journey is a great experience and at only R’s 350 for both of us, an absolute bargain.

We have planned to stay for one night in Ooty, with the option for more if we like it. As we pull in we decide we are not too sure. However, the weather changes and it starts to rain and gets really cooler. This gets us to decide that 1 night will definitely be enough (a view that is confirmed later when we wander into town for some lunch) as it seems a very non-descript place despite the colourful houses. An impression not helped by the heavily over cast sky.

We are staying at Hotel Sweekar, overlooking the town and racecourse which is right slap bang in the middle of the town.
Mamalla Bhavan - great food & service
It’s an English style bungalow and ok for the money (R’s 550) but a bit basic. Thankfully the owner is a nice chap who happily gives us extra blankets as we are feeling the cold.

We head back into town for a mooch and some lunch but despite the recommendations in LP it’s really hard to find anywhere that looks interesting and we have to walk for ages. It’s also raining – cold rain! Waterproof jackets required. In the end we head for a bar for a couple of beers then a local halal restaurant for some chicken kebabs. Not bad.

On the way back we call into the bus station and pre book our coach seats for the trip to Mysore in the morning. We are able to choose our seats which is great – first time this trip we are doing a long (5 hours) bus journey in India. More surprising is that M gets a discount for being of mature age!!

We dine at Kebab Corner after a few cheap beers at a local bar. The food and service are really good and reasonably priced.

We are up early and have a lovely
Colourful Mamallapuram
light breakfast at the Guest House and get to the bus stop to get to Mysore. Today the sun is shining and Ooty looks very different and more interesting. We reflect on this and realise perhaps we were perhaps being influenced by the weather and judging Ooty by our experiences elsewhere rather than accepting what it has to offer us as visitors. Ooty has a lot of amenities and areas of interest close by. Nature trails and trekking are big draws aswell as the local national parks.

It’s spread over a vast area. The pockets of housing are colourful and have a charm all of their own. The Nilgiri Tea plantations give a lovely colour and texture to the landscape; the land is fertile and green with fruit and vegetables growing. Other than Tea, the big draw here is chocolate – including chocolate tea (yuck says M). The chocolates (including a Jain version) are home made with a variety of fillings – nuts, raisins, dates etc – and sold in just about all general shops along the streets.

Being in South India, all the signs are in Telegu, as are the posters for films recently released and as
Comfort break & stop for refuelling - Ooty
it’s election time – wall to wall posters of politicians trying to grab your vote!

As we drive from away from Ooty we feel perhaps another day or so may have given us a totally different perspective of the place & its people. The drive is a challenge by anyone’s standards and more so when your driver is in a hurry. The bus has to negotiate 36 hairpin bends and most of the passengers (not us thankfully) end up throwing up into sick bags provided by the bus company. They even run out of them by the time we hit the plains. It does make us wonder why these folks who have paid quite a lot for this bus trip couldn’t take a motion sickness tablet (cost about Rs 5) that would stop their discomfort.

The drive takes us right through the heart of the Mudumalai National Reserve where we spot 4 wild elephants and many deer. Next we are into the Bandipur Tiger Reserve – but no tigers I’m afraid despite a thorough search around.

Eventually we hit Karnataka – the next state and eventually (after a 20 mins pit stop for a comfort break and
Devaraja Market - Mysore
some lunch) we arrive ahead of schedule in Mysore.

Mysore – The Garden City (we are not so sure!)

We arrive at the Mysore Central Bus station ½ hour ahead of schedule. It’s an impressive bus station, modern and bustling. It’s also clean and has good information counters, a few eateries (veg & non-veg), plenty of snack stands and all the facilities you would expect.

We are persuaded by a “tout” to try the Aishwaraya Residency nearby rather than go to our chosen hotel as it offers free wi-fi and various other amenities unlike the one we were going to for the same price. So we check it out and it’s ok – as much as we dislike dealing with touts, the free wi-fi clinches it for us as we need this for sorting out many things for our trips to Japan & The Philippines and to skype Sarah on her Big Birthday!!

It’s pretty hot in Mysore and our first impressions of the city is that it is well planned with wide streets, pretty clean, with buildings reflecting its history under Mughal rule, The Royal heritage, the British and now Indian independence. Most places in
Chamundi Hill Temple - Mysore
the central area are walkable. In theory it’s a place we should enjoy. But….What is interesting for us is the absence of good eating places in & around the centre. There are hundreds of Hotels that have small eating places (veg or non-veg) but very few decent restaurants. And so it doesn’t quite do it for us as a place of interest.

We read about a day trip of Mysore and Sirangapatna (the abode of the once King Tippu Sultan) run via the Karanataka Tourism Office which we decide to go for. At Rs 210 each, it starts at 8.30 am and finishes at about 8.30 pm.

We are the only foreigners on the small mini bus for the trip. The rest are folks from various parts of India visiting Mysore. The guide thankfully speaks in English, Hindi and Kannada (the local state language). The tour covers the following sites:

Jaganmohan Palace:

This is the old residence of one of the rulers of Mysore which is now an “Art Gallery” come Museum. Entry is Rs 130 for foreigners and we weren’t sure about going in but didn’t have a lot of option as we had to
The town & racecourse - Ooty
pay the guide up front for all the entry tickets – this included. We were pleasantly surprised though. The building has architectural merit. Inside it has a host of regal memorabilia, many rare musical instruments, some great paintings – notably one called The Glow of Hope which has a room to itself and is impressive as is a pencil drawing of Tagore. There were amazingly carved Tusks and a black stone elephant. The Rosewood hand carved furniture was awesome as was the marble small replica of the Mysore palace. Upstairs, there’s an amazing Ivory Palanquin that once carried the rulers here. The inside of the building looks tired but the size of it all gives a sense of what royalty had in days gone by.

Mysore Palace (Ambavilas Mahal):

The big cheese in Mysore without doubt. Entry is Rs 250 to the main palace and they want another Rs 280 from foreigners to see the residential bit of the palace. This is optional & we opt out. The Palace though is still a working palace for ceremonial events in Mysore. The big festival is Dussehra in Oct when the King and gentry go on an elaborate parade &
Devaraja Market Mysore
jamboree with decorated elephants, horses etc.

We are not allowed to take cameras in so no photographs unfortunately. The place is well maintained as it’s still private. The most striking areas are The Main Durbar, The Marriage room (which has the most amazing glass ceiling made of iron and stained glass manufactured in Glasgow. The scope of colours makes it breath-taking – a truly grand design for its day!) And finally the King’s private audience room – again the ceiling is a beautifully coloured stained glass marvel of craftsmanship. It brings the place alive – even today. The door to and from the room are amazingly carved with ivory insets. One is carved in Silver. All very regal and grand as befitting a king! Well worth the entry fee.

The surrounding garden and area is also well maintained and there are a variety of Temples at corners of the outer perimeter and very grand gateways on each side. The elephants are kept in an enclosure not far away. The palace glows with a hundred thousand light bulbs every Sunday between 7 and 8 pm & for big national events.

St Philomena’s Church (AKA St Joseph’s Cathedral):
Vishnu Bhavan - great breakfast & coffee - Mysore

It’s a catholic cathedral which has a Gothic look to it but neither the outside or inside are particularly spectacular. It’s a 10 min whistle stop trip.

The Mysore City Zoo:

It’s part of the trip & not somewhere we were looking forward to having had our fill of zoos (no disrespect to Pi & Pondicherry!!) However, this for us was the surprise package of the lot. Entry Rs 40 – foreigners and Indians (parity for once - yeah). It’s really clean, well laid out and the directions and signs lead you to all the sites. It looks well-kept and managed; there is significant investment in new areas being prepared for the animals. They have a great selection of birds including white peacocks which we’ve never seen before. Some of the other highlights for us were the really healthy Bengal Tigers, the awesome leopards, the cheetahs, the white rhino and the only Gorilla in India.

Chamundi Hill & Nandi - The Bull:

On top of Chamundi hill is a temple – nothing special to look at as Indian Temples go but is apparently one of the most sacred. A quick flit through (Rs 30 entry +
Entrance to Mysore Palace
Rs 2 for the shoes stand – a new Indian stealth tax or enterprise by all temples and mosques!! In addition to the ridiculously high entry fees for foreigners.)

Half way down the hill, there’s a 10 minute stop to see a huge Bull called Nandi (representing Shiva) carved from one very large stone – quite impressive really.

After a few photos we were ready for lunch.The break for lunch is at a Hotel complex in the city which looks in part like a building site. The options are a South Indian Thali & a North Indian Thali at a set price and not particularly a good advert for Mysore or Indian cuisine – enough said. The prices of the cold drinks were extortionate too.

Srirangapatnam:

Was the seat of Tippu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali. They ruled for 36 years. Tippu Sultan had his fort and palace here and was defeated by the British and killed after a bloody encounter having been betrayed by his uncle. The place Tippu was killed is marked by a stone. The fort is in ruin and was actually blown up by the Bristish within 6 hours of the
Five Rathas - backside view as they say
battle in 1799. The fort was strategically built on the confluence of 2 rivers. While there we stop for a visit to a very uninspiring Ranganatha Swamy Temple. Unfortunately, the guide misjudged his timings so we didn’t make it to Tippu’s summer palace which is supposed to be beautiful.

Brindavan Gardens:

The other big draw, for Indians particularly, are the Brindavan gardens – most of the middle aged and older generation who were fed on Bollywood movies (as there was no TV at the time) will recall many happy Indian songs being filmed here with hero and heroine prancing around each other coyly (with heavy suggestions of sexual attraction – Indian style of course). The gardens are at the bottom of a 3 km dam wall built by the kings of Mysore. The gardens are laid out reasonably well and separated in the middle by a lake. On one side is a nightly colourful fountain display to India music which most of the day trippers come for. It’s not quite worth the journey in our view – but Indians love gardens, sunsets and musical fountains so for them it is heaven!!

We eventually get back at 8.45pm
Ganesh's Butter Ball, Mam
and get dropped off near the bus stop so we can dive into the Bar for a cold beer or 2. Unfortunately, the guy serving us that night clearly didn’t like our presence in the place so ignored us for ages till his boss had to tell him off. A complete shit head compared to the guy who had served us really well the previous 2 nights.

The best eating experiences for us were at Hotel New Shilpashri Bar & Restaurant & The RRR Hotel, both in Gandhi Square. The latter is an institution and gets packed out. Their speciality is a vegetarian thali served on Banana leaves – a dying art in India. They also do a few non – veg dishes. Be prepared to queue a bit, but it’s worth it and the turnaround is really quick.

One place worth a visit is the area known as the Devaraja Market. It’s colourful and has a host of interesting stalls selling most things you are ever likely to need to live and eat. Drinks you have to get from a Bottle shop!!

Bengaluru

It’s difficult to say a lot about the place as it’s
Inside Devaraja market Mysore
been labelled the High Tech city & happening place in India etc. However, we are only here for about 3 hours and our experience in that time is pretty poor on a number of fronts – so we are aware that our comments may not reflect the real B.

The train journey from Mysore to B goes off without a hitch. It takes 3 hours on the Chaumandi Express which only runs from Mysore to B. The station at B is pretty big and clean and they have a left luggage counter which we use so that we might explore the city a bit. However, once out of the station – the main Bus station (Majestic) is reached via an underpass. The rest of the road is blocked off and the area looks like a building site. We try to catch a rickshaw to the City Market area (as we don’t have much time) and for 1km the guy asks for Rs 200. The others aren’t interested as we suspect that the fare is pretty low. As we have had no breakfast and left the Hotel in Mysore at 5.45 am we try a local eatery at the station.
High Street & Bus Stop - Mam
Crap coffee. Toilet flooded. The public “pay as you use” Toilets which seem to be all over the South charge C Rs 3 and M only 2? Given the heat we decide it might be better at the airport rather than hang around as we hear that it’s a brand spanking new place.

So au revoir Bengaluru – we seem sure we had the worst of what the city has to offer. The 40km journey to the airport is on the Vayu Vajra A/C Bus – a special airport shuttle which costs Rs 195 each compared to the Rs 770 quoted by the Prepaid Taxi stand at the railway station. It takes 1 hour and they depart on the ½ hour from the main city bus station known as Majestic. The journey takes us through much of the northern half of B with all its flyovers and many new housing developments. It reminds us of Pune in a way – which we liked a lot, though a lot bigger and more expensive (given the advertised prices for 2 & 3 bed flats here Rs 29 Lakh to 1.5 Crore).

Bengaluru airport is relatively new (parts of it still
High Street Ooty
look like its being completed) and has a lot of amenities and is a delight for travellers.

So, this whistle stop tour of some of the South, a last minute substitute for the hills and mountains of Darjeeling and Sikkim, has been a bit of a mixed experience but worth it if only for the train journey to Ooty, Mysore Palace & the carvings at Mamallapuram.

Paisagem de grande beleza: arrozais, agua em abundancia por entre blocos redondos de granito avermelhado. Bananais, coqueirais, caminhos de terra, muitas ruinas de um enorme imperio hindu dizimado pelos muculmanos e templos bonitos, alguns ainda vivios. Gente a lavar-se, a lavar roupa, beber, brincar no rio pela manha.

Se fecharmos os olhos a certas coisas (muito turistico)

Tour das ruinas em bicicleta com um grupo porreiro, sob calor torrido a horas improprias.

Lavei uma 'elefanta', Laxmi, que trabalha no templo. Grande paquiderme , pele aspera e enrugadinha e pelos como arame, a tromba brincalhona e rosada na ponta bufa feliz enquanto a esfregavamos. Grandes patas, solidos troncos, como ossos! E um lindo olhar molhado me olhava da grande cabeca.

Toquei pela primeira vez nos bagos leitosos (ainda nao polinizados, um agricultor explicou-me como 'funcionava'...) da planta do arroz, que tantas vezes tive no prato.

How to reach there


Trimurty temple is around 30 kms from Bangalore on Kanakapura road. If you are going from Banashankari temple, you have to go around 20 kms on National highway 209. However, you have to be vigilant to notice the temple at your left.
The Trimurthy temple


The temple is a combination of three temples, Ganesh, Hanuman and Srikrishna. There are huge statues of Ganesh, Hanuman and Srikrishna on easy of these temples. You can easily notice the three huge statues while going on Kanakapura road (NH 209). It is better that you go by your own vehicle, otherwise you have to try your luck on any Bangalore-Kanakapura bus.



Apart from the huge attractive statues on the temples, the next beautiful attraction of the temple is the garden. The garden has beautiful grass lawn and excellent collection of various plants.



There are various activities in the temple like annadana (free food). Besides there are festivals on various auspicious days, which are written in the notice boards in side the temple.



Apart from these three temples, there are also other temples like Shiva temple etc. The environment is very cool and peaceful and you will definitely enjoy to sit for some time inside the temples.



Although the temple is recently built it has the peace and piousness of old temples. It is colorful, attractive and surrounded by beautiful lawns and trees. It is worth visiting by everybody going on Bangalore-Kanakapura road.

St. Mary’s Basilica


St. Mary’s Basilica is the oldest church in Bangalore. It is located in the Shivaji nagar, next to Shivaji nagar bus stop. The institution was raised to the status of a Basilicaon the order of Pope John Paul VI in the year 1973. Mary’s Feast is celebrated with grand processions in this church every year.



As the church is centrally located, you can approach the church from Queen’s road side, from MG road, from Commercial Street, from Ulsoor lake side etc. However the place being in the heart of the city is overcrowded all the time.


The Mary’s feast celebration


The Mary’s feast is celebrated in the month of September. The Arch Bishop of Bangalore hoists flag in St. Mary’s Basilica to begin the festival. The festival continues for 9 days and ends on the 10<sup style=""margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"">th day with a car festival with grand procession.

Other activities are also organized such as thanks giving to elderly couples completing 50 years of marriage,
Celebrations around the church


Not only inside the church, you can find several idols of Mother Mary near the church with beautiful decorations. Usually the celebration continues for 10 days. The last day is celebrated with the car festival with huge crowd.



The above is a Mary’s statue decorated outside the church. These are temporary statues made specifically for this occasion. Similarly below is another temporary decoration on the roadside near the Basilica.


Celebrations inside Basilica


Thousands of people visit the church on this day. People have to stand on a long queue (picture below). Although the crowd is there for the whole day, the length of the queue increases as the time become closer to car festival.



Inside the church, the idol of mother Mary is finely decorated. Many priests take care of various aspects of the festival on the day. The idol of Jesus is also decorated and worshiped in a grand way.


The car festival


The last day of the 10-day long Mary’s feast is celebrated with a car festival. People start gathering in the mid day. The security forces create cordons around the church and don’t allow the crowd to go inside. Ave Maria music and prayers are chanted through loud speakers. Priests from various places come and gather here.



A chariot is decorated with beautiful flowers, lights etc. The idol of mother Mary is placed on it. Some highly ranked priests/ bishops sit on the chariot. Band parties play their music and drums. The place becomes fully crowded.



The Chariot is beautifully decorated. Especially the lights are arranged in a beautiful way. As they give different colors of light, each picture of the chariot will look different. Thousands of people go along with the Chariot. Although people here are generally disciplined, the law and order is maintained by a large number of police.



The festival is celebrated not only by the Christians but people of other religions too. As the Shivaji nagar area is more populated by the Muslims, having shops and businesses, they also get involved in the festival in various ways. The car festival is attended by thousands of people from across different religions.


Some important tips


Parking vehicles in the car festival will be a great problem, as such there is hardly any parking place in Shivaji Nagar. Besides on the day of Mary’s feast the traffic police will not allow any vehicle to enter from a km. If you are taking your vehicle then be ready to park it somewhere at 2 kms distance. Alternatively go by public transport till MG road or Queens road or some place nearby and then take a walk to the church.



St. Mary’s basilica is a 300 years old Church and organizing daily prayers. People of different religions visit it. You can visit it on any day, even if not in Mary’s feast.

Photography is allowed inside the church, you can take beautiful pictures of mother Mary and other views around.

There is possibility of having mild rainfall during September. Twice I got completely wet while watching car festival. Be prepared for that too.

How to reach there



You have to go on Bangalore - Hyderabad National Highway 7. On this road do not take a deviation to the airport. But still proceed until you reach a circle for Devanahalli township marked towards right. You have to go half km further and take a right turn from the highway.



Actually the fort is about 100 mtrs from the highway and visible from the road. But because the fort looks old and not attractive, you are very likely not to notice it from the road. I had never noticed the fort although I had gone more than 50 times on that highway. But this time after coming from the fort I realized that it is in fact visible from the highway.
About the Fort



There is a fort in Devanahalli was built by Mallabairegowda in 1501 A.D. Which was latter taken over by Tippu Sultan in 17th Century A.D. The present fort in Devanahalli is rebuilt by Hyder Ali and Tippu Sultan during 17th Century. The fort was then taken over by the British after Tippu lost the battle in Mysore war.



This fort is very different from what I was expecting it to be. I was expecting a ticket counter, a parking place, some guards and stuff. But actually the fort is just an entrance and nothing after that (for the tourists). Talking from a different angle the fort area is used as a regular habitation.

There is no ticket or entrance fee for the fort. The entrance of the fort is rather a regular road to pass through. You can drive in through the fort entrance and go to the habitation area. The entrance to the fort is bit narrow, just enough for a big car to go.



The fort is spread over an area of 20 acres. This is a living fort where many families are living inside. There are many temples inside the fort area, such as Venugopalswamy temple, Siddheswar swamy temple, Raghabendraswamy Math, Chandramouleswar Temple etc.

After we drove in through the fort entrance we first saw two temples, Venugopalswamy temple and Siddheswar Swamy temple. The Venugopalswamy temple is just behind the entrance of the fort, sharing the same common wall.



This is front side (above) of Venugopalaswamy temple. This temple is believed to be the oldest among other temples. The sculptures of this temple are very attractive. We saw a beautiful Vimana (below) which is used to carry the idol during festivals.



There are two black colored statues guarding both the sides of the main entrance of the Venugopalswamy temple (below).



While coming out of Venugopalswamy temple, we could see Siddheswar swamy temple and two other temples in the front within yards.



Siddheswar temple (below) is just in front of Venugopalswamy temple, on the other side of the road, say at 10 meters distance. There is a newly built Siva statue with mirrors which gives multiple reflection of the lord. In order to protect the mirrors from birds and animals the temple is fully covered by metal grill.



The temple has a traditional look with beautiful sculpture. Painting with beautiful colors has made it even more attractive.



The main deity of the temple is lord Siddheswar (behind me above). The deity is old and worshiped since several centuries. A new temple is built in the campus (behind me below) fitted with mirrors at all sides to give infinite reflections of lord Shiva and Parvati.



There are few more temples inside the fort area which we could not visit because of limited time. It was going to be envening and we thought to visit Tipu’s birth place before it gets dark. So we came out of the fort and went further on the same road for 200 meters. We saw a small memorial marked as Tipu’s sultan’s birth place.



However, it has just some archeological importance, but there is nothing much to see. It is just an arch of about 20 feet surrounded by a wall.


Something important at the end



There is nothing much to see in the fort. So don’t go with much expectation, which might lead to frustration. Similar in case of Tipu’s birth place. If you like old monuments and archeological places, then you would like this place.

However, if you are in Bangalore, it is worth driving a few kilometers to visit this place. Particularly if you like temples, you will get some beautiful temples within a kilometer radius.

There is no timing of the fort (as it is always open), no tickets (as the fort entry road is used as the public road). So you can go at any time of your convenience.

There are two Beautiful Nakoda Jain temples on both sides of the highway. They are beautiful and worth visiting.

Nandi hills is also on the same direction. You have to go 2 kms further on the National Highway and then take a left turn for Nandi hills. It will be a good idea to combine Devanahalli fort in your Nandi hills trip and first visit the fort while going to Nandi hills.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Kanakapura
March 2nd 2013
Published: March 2nd 2013


How to reach there



If you are going from Bangalore you have to first go to Kanakapura and then take the road going to Sangama/ Mekedatu. Although there are many busses to Kanakapura, there will be fewer busses to Mekedatu. It may be convenient to go by own vehicle.

After going to Kanakapura you have to leave the highway at Kanakapura and take a left turn for Mekedatu. The road here looks like a narrow lane (although widened afterwards) and is not easily recognized. It is better to ask people there for confirmation. Once you get the road, you have to move straight without any confusion.

Bangalore to Kanakapura 60kms, Kanakapura to Sangama 30+ Kms, Sangama to Mekedatu 4 kms, total around 100 Kms (one side).
Sangama the Confluence of Rivers



Sangama is the confluence of two rivers – Arkavathi and Kaveri (Cauvery). In Summer season there will be less water and you can easily walk inside the river. In rainy season there will be more water with heavy flow. Both the seasons are enjoyable although differently.

Near Sangam you will find some signboards warning you about the crocodiles and dangers in water. You should be careful about your safety. You can park you vehicle there near the road side and pay a parking fee.



We had gone to Sangam in April 2011. It was summer season and there was less water in the river as you can see in the picture below. The water was about 2 to 3 feet in the river. However, this was an advantage as we could walk into the river without any fear.



It was a Sunday and there were around 500 people in Sangam. As there was a good crowd, we did not fear about the crocodiles.



As there was less water we could fearlessly get into the water. However, in rainy season the river will be full of water. The place becomes suitable for river rafting and other water sports activities.



We saw many people were bathing in the water; we also had a cool bath. It is also believed to be auspicious to have bath in Sangam. The water was flowing very slowly. It was an interesting experience to float in the moving water.



After enjoying the water in Sangam we proceeded towards Mekedatu. We crossed the river and took the bus to Mekedatu on the other side of the river.
Mekedatu – the goats leap



Mekedatu is just 4 kms from Sangam. You must cross the river at sangam in order to visit mekedatu. If it is summer, there will be less water (as in the picture above) and you can walk through the river. In other seasons you have to cross the river by boats. As Sangam and Mekedatu are close to each other, both the places have to be combined in one single visit. 'Mekedatu' means 'goat's leap' in Kannada language.

Once you cross the river, you have two options to go to mekedatu. You can take the old noisy bus or take a walk to mekedatu depending on your physical strength, money and time. Walking will be more enjoyable though, bus will be faster. The bus will take 50 rupees per head. The same bus is shuttling between Sangam and Mekedatu. The frequency depends on the availability of people.

The picture below is the point at Mekedatu where people sell water, lemon drinks and butter milks. The sign board warns you to be careful as this is a “dangerous place”.



Once you reach Mekedatu, you have to climb down few hundred steps through the rocks to reach the actual spot. You have to get down first and then climb up a little to see the river Cauvery.



In Mekedatu, the river has become narrow and at a point as narrow as only about 20 feet between the two banks. As both the sides are made of strong granite, the water cannot expand further, it has to flow within this short rocky passage.



As per legend, the width of the river is so less that a goat would jump across, hence the place is named as Mekedatu. (Meke = goat, datu = cross in Kannada). The river runs through a deep narrow gorge.



It is interesting to see that the same river which is more than 150 meters at the confluence (at Sangam) flows within 10 meters width in Mekedatu. The river runs ferociously at this point within the rocky banks.


Other nearby places



If you are going from Bangalore, you can visit Trimurthy temple on the way on Bangalore Kanakapura highway.

You can visit Chunchi falls which is on the same route on a diversion 10 kms before sangama.

If you are planning for Chunchi falls then you may ignore TK falls which also come on the same Bangalore-Kanakapura highway. Chunchi falls will have more water and thrills than TK falls.

Mekedatu is also near sangama, just 4 kms by walk or bus from Sangam. Mekedatu and Sangama are twin locations and must be combined in the visit.

Muthathi, Bheemeshwari and Cauvery fishing camp are also close to Sangam. You can take a try there too.
Something important at the end


Drive slow as there are sharp unexpected turnings near Sangam which may cause accidents.

Leave home early and keep enough time in hand to enjoy the twin places.

The place is unbelievably beautiful and much more than my expectation. It can be compared to any national level tourist spot. The place is really worth visiting even in any season.

How to reach there


Chunchi falls is about 90 kms from Bangalore city. From Bangalore you have to go to Kanakapura. From Kanakapura you have to go on Sangama/ Mekedatu road. Before about 10 kms from Sangama you will find a signboard for chunchi falls to go towards left. After going for about 6 kms on rural road you will find chunchi falls.
The Waterfall


Chunchi fall is located on river Arkavati. The waterfall is nestled among the amazing ranges of rocks. You can park your vehicle in the open field there and walk inside the rocky area. The area is definitely risky and you will find some warning sign boards at the entrance.



Initially you will find a straight cut way to walk down for about 300 meters. Then you will find a canal bridge. As you will be eager to see water, you will immediately be excited to see that canal water and bridge in the jungle. But have patience to walk further there is much more to see ahead.



Then gradually there will be no demarcated route to walk. You will land up in a rocky zone, where you can either go nowhere (if you are scared) or you can go anywhere (if you can jump on the rocks). Now you are in the difficult part of trekking.



As there is no visible road, you will have some disadvantages. You may move this side to that side and get exhausted much before you reach the fall. If it is summer and mid day, then the place will be extremely hot (because of stones). You should better carry some drinking water with you. The other problem is if you are on a dry day or odd time and there is nobody, then you may feel scared and return back from half way.

There are two solutions; one is to go on a holiday where you can expect some more visitors on the spot. This will help you to trace the route on the rocks. Alternatively take a local from there who will guide you short cut route for a small price (say Rs 20 to 30).



We were lucky to have a local guide who took us straight into the water fall through all kinds of funny zig-zag path. We saw two waterfalls, one smaller while going inside and another bigger at the end. However, the water was less because of summer season. In rainy season, the water is ferocious as people say.



I got down to the water and took bath in the fall. It was extremely risky and thrilling at the same time. Cold water in hot summer was quite enjoyable. But I was afraid of the slippery stones and the depth on the other side.



Overall the experience was exciting in Chunchi falls. The water you see in picture was in extreme summer. There will be much more water in rainy season. The place surrounded by green forests look scary and adventurous. It was a great adventure trip for me and will be for anybody. (Note: This article was first posted in JournalSite )

Veerabhadreshwara temple is on a small hill located on the road side 12 kms from Ramanagaram on Kanakapura road. If you are going from Ramanagaram, you will first see Sabbakere from where a road goes to right side towards Siddheshwara beta. You can leave that road and go straight on Kanakapura road. You will find this temple within one km at the left side of the road. The vehicles can go to the foot of the hill and small vehicles can go up to the hill.

While coming from Ramagaram to Kanakapura you will find a beautiful arch on the left side of the road (right side while coming from Kanakpura to Ramanagaram). You can go through the arch and reach the hill temple within half km.



There are two ways to the hill, one driveway for the vehicles and another steps for the walkers. However, the driveway is not very wide for cars but wide enough for bikes.



Veerabhadra swamy temple is built with beautiful architecture. There is a statue of nandi in front of the temple. You have to climb a few steps for the temple and have darshan of the lord.



The beauty of the temple is that it is built on huge granite stones. Some of the boulders are more than 50 feet high. They look very terrific and magical.



You can see Siddheshwara beta from the Veerabhadra Temple hill top, which looks very tiny from about 4 kms distance. But if you have a zoom binocular or video camera you can see the hill clear with 30x –40x zoom.

If you are going on Ramanagaram - Kanakapura road, don’t forget to give a halt at this place. Even if you are going on Bangalore-Mysore road it is worth driving 15 kms inside to visit this temple.

How to reach there


If you are going from Bangalore, you can go straight on Mysore highway till Ramanagara. Then go further for 5 Kms more, you will see Janapadaloka at your right. If you are coming from Mysore then you will cross Channapatna and go further till you find it at your left before you reach Ramanagara. If you are going by bus, you can go upto Ramanagara by bus, and then take some local conveyance till Janapadaloka. The signboard of Janapadaloka is quite huge and prominently visible from distance.


The entry fee


There is a ticket counter near the entrance gate. There is plenty of parking place on the highway side. We parked the car there and got the entrance tickets. The tickets were like:

Entry fee: Rs 10 per person, Kids – Rs 5

Camera fees: Rs 100 (if you want to take pictures inside museums)

Video show – Rs 5 (there are specific timings of the show)

Timmings: 9.00 am To 5.30 pm, Tuesday holiday


The entrance gate or mahadwara


The entrance gate is one of the attractions of Janapadaloka. A majestic door adorned with Harige and Trumpets and tall brass Nandidwajas on either side of the pathway enhance the grandeur of the entrance. We were there during July 2011 and there was a workshop for drum beating (Charma Vadya Sibira) was going on during that time.


Lokamata Mandira


Lokamatha Mandira is a museum displaying articles of daily use of folk people like cooking vessels, equipments used for farming and animal husbandry and other such rural activities.


Chithra Kuteera


""Chithra Kuteera"" which reflects different stages of the founder's literary achievements and struggle during the building of Janapada Loka and also houses photographs of different folk art forms of Karnataka.


Loka Mahal


""Loka Mahal"" is a two-storied building where more than 5000 folk artifacts are aesthetically displayed. The artifacts include agricultural, hunting and fishing implements, weapons, ingenious household gadgets, masks, dolls and shadow puppets etc.


Doddamane


A community house called “Doddamane"" built in the traditional rural style. It serve as a place for workshops and seminars. During that period there was a workshop on drum beating and we had an opportunity to see the fantastic drum beating show.


The Garden and Lake


When you go inside you find gardens and a lake (known as Loka Sarobara). Some people say that there was boating facility in the lake, but we did not see any boat there. We saw an attractive logo board of Janapadaloka made in the lawn.



Behind the lake, there are some interesting cottages. They are just empty and don’t seem to be used for any purpose. However, they look pretty attractive like tribal cottages.


Cafeteria


There are various other things to see in the campus, such as, art gallery, amphitheatre, playground for children, gardens and statues etc. There was also a canteen inside the campus. We enjoyed some tea and snacks in the canteen, although the items were highly overpriced than outside.

.
Something additional


The most attractive item for us was drum-beating event. A group of 20 participants were demonstrating their drum beating with various styles and dances. We took a full video of their drum beating and enjoyed for long time.

Drinking water and toilets are available inside Janapadaloka. I did not see certain things which I was expecting, but I saw many more things which I had never expected. It is a must go for people traveling frequently between Bangalore and Mysore.

We visited this place after visiting Ramadevara beta and Siddheswhar beta as all these are close to Ramanagara. If you are combining more than one place in your tour you should start early to give enough time to each of the place.

How to reach there



Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta is about 65 km from Bangalore. You have to go straight on Mysore road till Ramanagaram. From Ramanagaram take left turn towards Kanakpura. Siddheswar Beta is 13 km from Ramanagaram situated near Avverahalli along Ramanagara-Kanakapura Road. The road is motorable and good.

Route of Bangalore to Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta: Bangalore–(take Mysore Road)–12 km–>Kengeri–18 km–>Bidadi–20 km–>Ramanagaram–take left turn towards kanakapura ->13 km–>Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta


About the place



Rebena Siddheshwar beta is famous for Siddheshwar temple. It is also popular among the trekkers and rock climbers. It is better to visit this place in winter as you may feel very tiring to climb hills in summer. We went there during August 2011.

There are totally 3 temples in the hill complex– at the top is Revanna Siddeshwara temple, midway is Bheemeshwari (named after the pandava Bheema) and Renukamba temple at the base. We first went to Renukamba temple which is at the foot of the hill.



After visiting Renukamba temple one has to go up to the hill. The hill is made of huge granite stones, very attractive to look. If you have a vehicle you can ride up, otherwise you can take the steps.



Behind me (above) is the huge stone hill. The left side road is for vehicles, the right side steps are for pedestrians. While going on this road we saw the temple chariot.



This temple is famous in Karnataka and visited by devotees from all over Karnataka, The hill is more than 3000 feet above the sea level. The main Idol is in the cave temple on the hill. The place has rich history linked with the Gangas, Kempegowda and Tipu Sultan.



This is the Siddheswhar temple on the top of the hill. The outside views from this hill are very attractive. It is worth visiting the place.
Other nearby places



Ramgad or Ramadevara Beta is also near Ramanagara. If you start early you can plan to combine visiting Siddheshwar beta with Ramadevara beta.

Ramanagara is famous for its silk market, one of the biggest silk market in India, known as Silk town.

Kengal hanumantharaaya temple is nearest visiting place in ramanagara City. One may have food in Lokaruchi (Kamat group) and visit Janapada loka just next to Kamat Lokaruchi.

Mysore Palace
We checked into the Chandra Palace Hotel (not as fancy as it sounds) around 8:00 a.m. on the 8th. Although the room was pretty big and fairly nice, we were informed that whoever had told us the price per night was misinformed, and the already overpriced room was actually more expensive than we'd been told. The staff there was also rather cranky, so we decided to stay one night then move to a much cheaper, though slightly smaller and grungier, place the next day. Unfortunately we realized that Mysore isn't the best place for tourist lodging, in that most hotels are filthy, overpriced, loud, and smell like smoke. We managed fine, though.

After a post-overnight bus nap, we spent our first afternoon in the city touring Mysore's trademark Maharaja's Palace, once home to the 24th Wadiyar raja. The palace was very beautiful with brightly painted ceilings and columns, as well as amazing hand carved wooden doors. However, its upkeep and preservation appeared to be lacking, which was unfortunate considering its intricate craftmanship. We were required to take our shoes off to enter the palace, and, since the floor had obviously not been cleaned in quite awhile (if ever), this was
Palace Gate
pretty gross. Also, similar to when we visited the museum in Mumbai, all of the Indian tourists were pushing and shoving to get ahead of one another, making the pathway through the palace rather cramped. One interesting thing we noticed (and have continued to notice since) is the way security is handled in India. There were security guards at the palace ""checking"" people's bags - basically by simply glancing inside them with little to no rummaging around - and there were metal detectors that everyone chose to walk through despite the fact that the guards supposedly operating them were off in the corner smoking cigarettes. The metal detector beeped every five seconds, hopefully from people's jewelry, belts, etc., but the guards paid no mind. You could easily smuggle something inside and no one would even know. On the contrary, when we visited a fancy bookstore in the city, we had to leave our bags at the door, get searched and go through a metal detector that actually had a guard on duty. Apparently shoplifting is a bigger concern in Mysore than someone blowing up the palace. But who am I to judge?

Our second day began with lunch at
Sweet Shop
a great little place we found in KR Circle, one of the main eating/shopping areas in town. A nice British couple sat down at our table (it's pretty common for strangers to share tables in India when a place is busy, and so far it's been a great way for us to meet and talk to people!) so we spent a good hour or so talking to them before going our separate ways. Afterward, we bought some famous Mysore pak from the well known Guru Sweet Shop across the street. This delicious melt-in-your-mouth treat has a similar consistency to sugar cookie dough, and I'm pretty sure its main ingredients are pure butter and sugar... a few bites and you're good to go, but Scott and I overindulged a few times. Then we stopped by the market and bought the tiniest and best bananas I've ever had in my life. Yum!

Our next destination was the government operated Cauvery's Arts and Crafts Emporium. These emporiums are scattered throughout India and sell a variety of the region's handicrafts at a (supposedly) reasonable price. We browsed through the silk products, jewelry, paintings, incense and sandalwood carvings. We wanted to buy a sandalwood
Chamundeswari Temple
sculpture, but they were way too expensive, so we bought two paintings which had been painted on leaves - very cool - some incense and some sandalwood soap. While we were there, we ran into an American man whose daughter graduated from Clemson and talked to him for a bit. Then we went to the bus station and took a public bus to Chamundi Hill, which was probably the scariest bus ride of my life. Apparently it's perfectly fine to speed around blind curves while going up a mountain past other buses that are coming down. Oh, and you can pass cars on curves. In a giant bus. On a mountain. We almost died. Anyways...when we got there, alive, thankfully, we toured the 12th century temple, which was impressive on the outside, but a bit underwhelming overall. There was a shrine inside containing a solid gold statue of a god, but we weren't allowed to get close enough to get a good view of it. The most interesting thing we saw were several extremely fat, presumably pregnant monkeys hanging around the temple. Since it was a hazy day and the view wasn't wonderful, we began our descent via the 1,000
Nandi (Shiva's Vehicle)
something steps down. (There was no way we were taking another bus!) At the bottom, we looked around for a rickshaw to take back to our hotel. Unsure of how much to pay for one, we approached a police officer who was sitting in his car nearby. He was very friendly and helpful, asked us a lot of questions about ourselves, and ultimately got us what we think was a really good deal for a rickshaw without us having to haggle.

The next day, neither of us were feeling very well and we'd already seen most of the sights, so we decided to have a lazy day relaxing. This consisted of Scott napping while I did all of our laundry in a bucket in the bathroom then hung it to dry on the huge spider web of a clothesline I constructed in our room with some rope we'd brought. Very relaxing. The following day we were off on the night train to Kochi, located south of Mysore in the state of Kerala.

Interesting fact: apparently (and quite unfortunately) we barely missed a harvest festival in Mysore where they paint all the cows yellow and their horns various colors,
Tiger!
then make them jump over fire. I was wondering why it looked like someone had taken a highlighter to all the cows...

Marche - villageoise
Bijapur est une ville plus grande, approx. 200 000 habitants, en majorité musulmans. On a eu une belle surprise en découvrant une ville assez calme (sauf la Station Road évidement), avec des habitants très accueillants, ouverts, sociables et souriants. On est arrives dimanche alors on s'est précipites aller voir le marche. Quelle fête! Des femmes d'une ethnie très spéciale, qui habitent un village a 15 km de Bijapur, viennent vendre leur produits au marche. On n'osait pas les prendre en photos mais elles sont très gentilles et se laissent prendre en photo sans problème. D'ailleurs la majorité des gens au marche nous demandaient de prendre des photos d'eux. La joie quoi! On a profite au max et on se sentait comme des enfants fou. On a fait plein de photos.
Les autres jours nous avons visite les attraits historico-artistiques: des mausolées des sultans musulmans du XVI- XVII s, des vieilles mosquées. On s'est même balade en tonga, petite charrette sur 2 roues tirée par un cheval. Nous avons passe 3 jours paisibles dans une grande chambre d'un hôtel très sympathique avec jardin au palmiers ou il faisait bon prendre son souper (resto végétarien sans alcool)Nous avons eu d'ailleurs assez souvent des
Marche - sucreries
chambres très grandes, avec sofa, TV écran plat (qu'on utilise pas) et salles de bain énormes. Des fois nous avons eu 3 lits, mais la plupart du temps il y a un lit double et on nous met un matelas pour la 3e personne. Nous avons eu toute sorte de douches, le summum étant une douche ""jacuzzi"" car l'eau jaillissait de partout les tuyaux étant perforés a plusieurs places! Nous n'avons pas tout le temps d'eau chaude mais ça ne nous dérange pas car elle est tiède et avec la chaleur nous n'avons pas besoin de plus.Nous quittons aujourd'hui l'état de Karnataka. Il nous a semble plus propre que Tamil Nadu, avec plus de ville aux trottoirs et moins de dépotoirs. La poussière est aussi présente que dans d'autre état, en dépit du fait qu'il y a beaucoup de verdure, car les routes sont très poussiéreuses. En Tamil Nadu le portrait de la première ministre était omniprésent (au point de la nausée) mais au Karnataka nous n'avons jamais vu de portrait politique et nous ne connaissons pas du tout le visage du premier ministre. J'ai lu dans un journal que cet état est très discret et je peux dire que
Marche - etal
c'est vrai.Rendez-vous dans l'état voisin!

February 18th 2013
Published: February 18th 2013


DSCN8320
Though it saddens me to begin this post on a negative note, I must say that the process of getting from Gokarna to Hampi was nothing less than a nightmare. After about a 45 minute ride, we arrived at the bus stop in Ankola around 8:00 p.m. via a public bus from Gokarna. Just to be on the safe side, we’d gotten there quite early (3 hours early, to be exact), so we had some time to kill. We read our books and eventually got some dinner, but as 11:00 p.m. rolled around, our bus was nowhere to be found. The staff working at the bus stop withheld whatever information they had about our bus’s whereabouts, but occasionally we overheard talk about either an accident or a breakdown… In any case, we waited for a total of 6 hours before a bus – which wasn’t even the bus we paid for – showed up at 2:00 a.m. Since everything else was full when we booked our tickets, we’d paid 2,000 rupees for an A/C sleeper, but we ended up having to cram into a seater bus with several other disgruntled travelers, one of whom snored loudly and had frequent night terrors.
DSCN8134
We assumed we would get our money back, but when we contacted the company they said the most we could get back was 200 rupees, since supposedly the bus that was sent for us cost 900 rupees apiece (the fact that this was not the bus we paid for or that it was 3 hours late didn’t seem to factor into this wonderful customer service…). In the end, we decided to cut our losses, move on, and enjoy our time in Hampi.

We pulled into the ancient town around 8:00 a.m. and were immediately greeted by at least a dozen rickshaw drivers who were so eager to take us one place or another that they literally blocked the door to the bus, preventing us from exiting without being squished like sardines. When we finally broke down and told them where we were staying, we got one strangely low offer after another – one guy even said he would drive us for free. This is when we realized we were within about a two minute’s walking distance from our guesthouse, and these guys were just trying to get in our good graces so we would allow one of them to
DSCN8162
act as our tour guide and drive us around all day for a pretty penny. After we wised up, we began walking and were astonished (and annoyed) to find the rickshaw drivers had not yet given up and were driving alongside us, still shouting out offers. It was rather stifling and overwhelming, especially after barely getting any sleep, but they eventually left us alone and we were able to find our guesthouse, where we immediately passed out for 3 hours.

When we woke up, we decided to explore some of Hampi’s ruins near our guesthouse to get a feel for the ancient city. A bit of info about Hampi: imagine a surreal landscape of giant boulders balanced delicately but sturdily atop one another for miles in every direction. This wondrous natural landscape was once home to Vijayanagar, the ancient “City of Victory” whose ruins surround the winding River Tungabhadra. This popular tourist destination for Indians and Westerners alike used to be a thriving Hindu kingdom, but was attacked and ultimately defeated by Muslim invaders in 1565, leaving only what are now the ruins of Hampi, which, due to weather and a lack of proper preservation, are in danger of
DSCN8213
continuous erosion and destruction. For now, however, the ruins are a marvelous spectacle – definitely worth even the most horrible of bus rides to see.

Being in Hampi feels like being in another era or world. One can view ruins of impressive buildings and temples, as well as giant sculptures of Hindu gods, and there is even evidence of an ancient, sophisticated irrigation system, which is still used today to feed the city’s banana farms. On our second day there, we rented an old automatic motorcycle (whose condition was questionable) so that we could cover more ground. We began at the Archaeological Museum – not terribly interesting, but it did have a good model of all the ruins, helping to put our surroundings into perspective. We then continued to the remnants of the Royal Enclosure, where we wandered around for a long time. There, we were surrounded by school children on field trips who were fascinated by us, wanting to know our names, where we were from and if we’d take pictures of/with them. I’m pretty sure they were more interested in our digital camera than they were in us…but they were seriously adorable.

On our way out,
DSCN8249
we passed a teenage boy selling postcards. As we got closer, I noticed that he had cerebral palsy or a similar condition, but I also noticed his wide, happy smile, bright eyes and mop of shaggy hair. I couldn’t help but go over and talk to him. As I browsed his merchandise, he answered our questions about Hampi, and we talked for a bit. He was happy to talk with us, asking us about America and giving us directions to the various ruins we wanted to see. I gave him 20 rupees, as well as (to his surprise and delight) our last, crumpled American dollar, and left with a postcard and a lasting impression caused by a kindhearted boy with a big, beautiful smile.

Our next stop was Vitthala Temple, where we ran into, by chance, our German cabin mate from our train ride to Arambol. That night, we went back to our guesthouse to shower and get ready for bed, but as soon as Scott went into the bathroom, he saw a rat on the windowsill! It seemed even more surprised to see us as we were to see it, and, in its attempt to run away, it
DSCN8375
fell into the toilet and began flailing about. For a rat, it was actually quite cute (I think it was a baby), and I felt bad for the poor thing – I knew when we asked the owner to come remove it, it would end up as dinner for some lucky stray cat outside…which is precisely what happened. Sadness.

Our last day was spent checking out the nearby and impressive (and still in use) Virupaksha Temple, where we got to watch the temple elephant, Lakshmi, get “made up” for the day with colorful, chalky powder applied in religious Hindu designs. We were also surrounded by lots of loud, rambunctious monkeys, which was our cue to leave. Afterwards, we walked to some nearby ruins, got some lunch, and sat in a café reading until it was time to catch a local bus to Hospet where our sleeper bus would (hopefully) pick us up. We made it, bought some snacks, and hopped on our bus at 8:30 p.m. Aside from some brief motion sickness, a lack of bathroom stops (I had the lovely opportunity to relieve myself on the side of the road at 2:45 a.m. …), and my i-pod dying,
DSCN8155
the ride was smooth and comfortable, and we arrived safely to Mysore, our next destination.

India 001
(I wrote this weeks ago and have been meaning to edit it before posting it. However, I have giving in to the fact that I probably won't find the time to do this. So hear it is in the raw...)





This weekend we went to Mysor, about 5 hours drive from Shanti Bhavan. Much more open than other India cities and towns, the atmosphere felt a bit slowing and more relaxing. Though cars still packed the streets, the wideness of the main streets made the traffic less daunting. A weekend away in a lovely city, with lovely people, eating delicious food and seeing interesting sites: It was a good weekend.

We visited the Mysor Palace, the home of the Maharaja built during British rule. Architecturally the palace was stunning and interesting. Mixing Hindu and Gothic styles it is a building unlike any I have seen. Despite the beauty, I was revisited by this now familiar feeling of discomfort I experience whenever I see such extravagance. When our tour guide told us how many pounds of gold was used to make the Maharaja’s throne, or when he pointed out the ivory inlaid doors, I think he
India 002
meant to impress. I just felt sick.

I was interested to learn that most of the palace came from elsewhere. Stained glass from Scotland. Tiles from England. Chandelier from Belgium. Stone from somewhere. Brass from somewhere else. I don’t know why this surprises me. Foreign treasures are a sign of wealth, after all.

Much more I enjoyed going to Devaraja Market, a riot of colors and an scream of smells. Bright powdered pigment. Fruits and vegetables. Spices. Fragrant oils. Persistent shopkeepers asking me where I was from in order to coax me into a purchase. Though I am not good at haggling nor do I ever care to become practiced in the art, I am glad to have found myself in the middle of such a vibrant and bustling and beautiful mess.

That evening we had intended to visit some gardens, apparently beautiful at night. Unfortunately, due to a water dispute, the gardens were closed for the weekend. Instead, we went to temple on top of Chamundi Hill. It was beautiful. Overlooking, the city at sunset I felt I could breathe. The sky was soft, a swirl of purples and pinks. I was visited by another now
India 003
familiar feeling, thought this one more pleasant. A feeling of that the world is simultaneously incomprehensibly small and unfathomably huge. When I look at the sky, I feel at home. I am reminded that we all share the blue above us and the earth below. Although I am far from home, it is still the same air and same rock. But big. So, so big. So many steps. So much of this rock I have not, and will not, see. So much air between my lungs and yours.

The morning we went to a nature park. More lovely open air to breath. More beautiful things to see. We took a paddle boat ride in a lovely pond, that I afterwards learned is home to crocodiles. I saw peacocks and other birds of which I still do not know the name.

After lunch, we left Mysor for a small Tibetan village that somehow found itself in Southwest India. The monastery was peaceful. Winding paths through open space. The temples had vaulting ceilings in which the sound of chimes clung to the air. While I appreciated the tranquility of the place I am still baffled and a bit disturbed by
India 004
the need for building-tall golden statues.

In my wanderings around the compound, I say many of the young monks. How strange it would be to grow up in a monastery. I suppose not much different than living in Shanti Bhavan. Away from family, living in dormitories, little time unscheduled or alone.

After dinner (for the record, we had gobi Manchurian at every lunch and dinner this weekend, and I am still not tired of it), I sat with Masha waiting for the others to do a bit of shopping. We talked about her leaving. How I dread it, but do not fear it because I know that we will see each other again. We talked about traveling and what the future might hold. Now that I have seen more of the world, I realize how little of it I have scene. How little I know. Now that I have started, I don’t want to stop. I want to see as much as I can. To taste, hear, smell, and try to understand more of this small, gigantic rock. Now that I am moving, it is hard to stop. In our conversation, I realized how awake I had felt
India 005
all weekend. I don’t want that feeling to go away.

The drive back was longer than our trip to Mysor, as the Tibetan village was an hour outside of the city in the opposite direction from the school. We pasted the time playing games and chatting, but eventually our conversation would give way to silence as we watched the nightscape zoom past. As the hour grew later, traffic increased. For the first time since being in India, I saw accidents. It was horrible. A man on the side of the road surrounded by a cluster of helping hands. Later, we saw another crowd of people. A bloody man leaning against a knelling figure waiting as another called for help. And then later, a man prostrate on the road a friend or stranger talking to him a motorcycle yards away. I am grateful that every accident we saw was met with by a crowd of good Samaritans. But I ache to think of how long it probably took for medical help to arrive. As I tried to push thoughts of the men’s families from my head, I thought of my own. The distance between us felt larger than it ever
India 006
has. Met by the sudden shock and sadness of an accident, all I wanted was to be home. My desire to keep moving was replaced by a longing to be still and to be with the people I love.

Such a hard thing to balance, the desire for new and exciting, and the need for the familiar and beloved. I wrote in a poem, “Sometimes it feels like wings used to be there or will be there. Sometimes it feels like my feet extend into the ground, roots weaving their way deep, to the source of something. Is the answer above or below. Above of below? Below of above?”



Thankful for…

Open spaces

Sunsets

Curbside conversations

Seatbelts

Roots and wings

Badami - les ""montagnes""
Elles sont faites comme un fort, mais ici il y avait aussi un vrai fort
On s'est arrache a la magie et chaleur de Hampi (+37C la dernière journée) pour continuer notre voyage dans le coeur de l'Inde du sud. C'est le pays de la civilisation/dynastie chalukya qui a régné ici du Ve au XIIe siècle. Hampi est l'apogée de leurs créations en sculptures et en construction de temples, alors nous avons remonte vers le berceau de cet art magnifique: Badami, Aihole et Pattadakal. On voit bien l'évolution de la construction de temples (au début les temples étaient dans des caves, avec des sculptures incroyables, par après ils ont commence a construire eux même des bâtisses, ornées toujours par de magnifiques sculptures).Mais au delà de l'attrait artistique de ces petites villes et villages, il y a le retour dans le temps. Car dans cette région le temps semble être arrêté il y a plus de 1000 ans. Il y a des vieux arbres magnifiques qui protègent par leur voûte majestueuse la route et au delà, il y a les champs vert de riz, de tournesol, de céréales, et les gens qui travaillent enveloppes dans un tissu, pieds nus, avec une herse. Des fois ils labourent avec une charrue tirée par 2 boeufs. Dans les villages, les
Badami - vers les caves
maisons sont construites accotées sur les murs des temples. Les femmes passent les céréales aux tamis fait en pailles. Les chars tirés par des boeufs passent lentement. Seuls témoins tristes de notre époque, les bouteilles en plastic et les plats en aluminium au bord des routes! Les chalukya ont profite d'une belle chaîne de petites montagnes aplaties, qui donne l'impression d'un fort sans fin. La roche rouge a servi a construire de vrais forts de défense, mais aussi des beaux temples sculptes. Le centre de Badami, ou nous avons loge, est infernal le soir, mais autrement tout est paisible et intemporel. Seul bémol, les jeunes enfants qui sont plus tannant qu'ailleurs et beaucoup plus persistant a demander des crayons, chocolats, argent, n'importe quoi. A croire que c'est la faute des touristes qui leur ont donne des mauvaises habitudes!Nous nous réfugions le soir dans le jardin de notre hôtel, a l'écart du bruit et de a folie, pour siroter une bière Kingfisher strong (nous, es filles) et admirer les singes venues se coucher dans l'arbre a cote, pendant qu'on mangeait avec plaisir notre masala. On est comme en ""automne"", alors c'est e temps du melon d'eau et des raisins. On achète
Badami - sculpture dans une cave VI s
souvent des melons, des raisins, des bananes, saputas (petit fruit banal, beige, mais très sucre a l'intérieur) et papayas. On profite pour manger ces fruits mûris au soleil. Cote bouffe, on aime beaucoup les plats, très relevés d'ailleurs! Huguette s'est habituée et elle mange presqu'aussi piquant que nous autres. On n'a pas réussi a maigrir (sauf Antoine) car on se gave de bonnes choses.

Hampi - vue de notre terrasse
Nous sommes partis en train de Bengalore vers Hospet, la ville la plus proche de Hampi. Premier voyage en train en Inde pour Huguette. Introduction agréable car nous avons des billets 2e classe dans un compartiment avec lits (même si nous voyageons 8 heures de jour, car il n'y avait pas de billets pour le train de nuit), et nous sommes d'ailleurs les seuls passagers dans le compartiment. Seul bémol: nous avons vu un souris et 2-3 rats courants au long des murs. Brrrrr!
Le paysage laissait présager celui de Hampi: des grandes roches avec des formes incroyables parsemées sur la plaine (apparemment il y a eu une forte activité volcanique quelques millions d'années auparavant).

Hampi est au coeur de l'Inde du sud. Il y a 2-3 petites rues très touristiques perdues dans le paysage général de ruines de temples, de palais et roches incroyables. Au bord d'une rivière qui serpente paresseusement parmi les roches, rizières, vaches, chèvres et temples.C'est hallucinant! Notre chambre est sur une terrasse qui donne vers le temple, les roches et vers un arbre plein de singes! Le premier soir nous sommes arrives en plein concert de musique classique dans la cour du temple voisin. Nous

avons passe 3 jours de paraisse, d'immersion dans l'histoire, de soleil brûlant et des expériences inoubliables (traversée de la rivière en petit bateau pour voir le village authentique de l'autre cote, déjeuner dans un petit resto local avec un thali inusité, promenades au long de la rivière, marches sur les roches brûlantes pour découvrir des temples incroyables de richesse artistique, jus locaux).

Mysore - marche, fleurs
Nous sommes maintenant dans l'etat de Karnataka ou les gens parlent kannada! De quoi se meler quand ils nous demandent d'ou nous venons, hi! hi!

MYSORE - coup de coeur

On appelle Mysore la ville de palais. Tipu Sultan avait construit 7 et le maharaja en a rajoute d'autres. Mais ce n'est pas seulement a cause de ça qu'elle est notre coup de coeur. C'est une ville raisonnablement grande (approx. 800 000 habitants), propre, sans trop de mendiants, avec de beaux trottoirs, de grands boulevards et de rond points immenses au milieu desquels il y a de belles statues (Tipu Sultan, le dernier maharaja, Ghandi, etc). Les chauffeurs de tuk-tuk ne sont ni trop agressifs ni trop trompeurs! Il y a une belle atmosphère d'un autre siècle. Le soir au bazar c'est ahurissant de couleurs et odeurs. Les commerçants sont souriants et pas mal doués (un jeune garçon de 10 ans a réussi a nous convaincre a acheter d'huile essentiel sans qu'on aie besoin!).
Le palais du maharaja, qui a seulement 100 ans (parce que le vieux qui était en bois est passe au feu) est absolument superbe, avec un mix d'architecture indo-saracenique, des vitraux, plafonds peints et planchers
Mysore - arche, vendeur de parfums
en mosaïque avec le même motif, peintures murales décrivant la vie au temps du raj! Une merveille! Encore plus charmant le palais d'été de Tipu Sultan, qui se trouve sur une petite île au nord de la ville. Un vrai bijoux en bois peint, au milieu d'un jardin paisible, au bord de la rivière! Huguette et moi avons passe la journée la pendant qu'Antoine prenait un ""break"". C'était idyllique et il y avait multitudes d'oiseaux de tous les couleurs. Et pour sceller notre souvenir, un souper a la chandelle sur le toit-terrasse d'un bon resto, arose par une bonne biere Kingfischer (la 3e du voyage pour les filles car Antoine ne veut pas nous accompagner!)

BENGALURU - a éviter pour l'instant

C'est une grande métropole de presque 6 millions d'habitants. Elle nous a accueilli avec le mix habituel des grandes villes: pollution, dépotoirs en bord de route, odeurs désagréables, traffic d'enfer. Le tout exacerbe par le chantier immense du nouveau métro. Donc plus d'embouteillages, déchets, pollution!. Heureusement il y a des parcs immenses et magnifiques (40 et 120 ha!) ou tu oublies complètement que tu te trouves dans ce capharnaüm. C'est d'ailleurs une ville très dynamique et presque
Mysore - marche, fruits
20 000 d'étrangers vivent et travaillent la. La ville est très prisée par les jeunes car il y a plusieurs malls comme dans les pays occidentaux, mais les malls ne sont pas notre passion! On l'a quitte sans regret mais contents de l'avoir vu quand-même.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Gokarna
February 9th 2013
Published: February 11th 2013


Decorated chariot (not exactly sure about its purpose)
Our journey from Arambol to Gokarna, a sacred seaside town in the state of Karnataka, directly below Goa on India’s west coast, began with a train ride from Pernhem station to Margao. When we arrived in Margao a few hours later, we bought tickets for the “express” train to Gokarna. This train would supposedly arrive sooner and get us to Gokarna faster than the normal train, but, as it turned out, the slower train was on time and left on time, while our train was an hour and a half late! Once we were finally on the train, we had to search for empty seats, as it was rather crowded, and we ended up sitting in one of the last cars alongside a group of beggar children and an elderly man who appeared to be with them. One of the children was a toddler and was sitting barefoot and naked on the floor, occasionally picking up trash and putting it in his mouth with no supervision. Each of the older children asked us and the other passengers for money multiple times, but they made such a ruckus by yelling loudly and running back and forth from car to car, climbing all
The walk from town to the beach
over the seats (and sometimes over people), that we eventually became irritated by them.

I must admit that, while I did sympathize with these children, I instinctively, perhaps without good reason, felt the need to keep a close eye on my things for fear that they might try to swipe something. I could probably attribute this fear to books I’ve read and movies I’ve seen that portray street children in a negative light, but, unfortunately, I’ve learned that in India it can be a reasonable concern. Ultimately, everything was fine, and, as we stepped off the train at the Gokarna station, the children leaned out the windows waving and yelling goodbye to us.

We took a rickshaw into town around 4:30 p.m. and were dropped off at our guesthouse, the Haripriya Residency. Our host came out to greet us immediately, showing us to our incredibly spacious and clean room and then serving us masala chai in her living room. The couple who own the guesthouse built it as their own and later added several rooms. We sat and talked with her awhile about her family and the town, and she happily gave us advice for sightseeing as well
This lizard loved to pose for the camera!
as recommendations for dinner. Then we set out to explore a bit.

We were happy to find that Gokarna is far less touristy than Arambol. Though its main street is dotted with souvenir shops, it actually felt like an Indian town where not everyone is in the tourist business. Gokarna is considered a very sacred site, attracting pilgrims from all over India who want to dip their feet into the sea’s holy water. We quickly discovered, however, that the holy beach is not really a good place to hang out or swim because it is littered with trash and cow pies. This seemed quite strange to us, since the other beaches in the town are very clean and beautiful. We’ve come to realize during our time in India that littering is widely practiced and accepted – it’s simply part of the culture. Unlike Americans who are raised on the notion that littering is unacceptable and bad for the earth, Indians as a whole devote little time, money or energy toward protecting the environment, perhaps because that’s how they were raised and how it’s always been, or perhaps because they have more immediate issues to concern themselves with. Either way,
Our first glimpse of the beach
though I find it difficult not to cringe when I see someone throw a plastic bottle on the ground when there’s a trash can right next to them, I have to remind myself that this culture I have chosen to immerse myself in is beautiful in as many ways as it differs from my own.

Another cultural difference between India and America is it’s view and treatment of cows as holy creatures. They are not killed or eaten, but are left alone to roam freely throughout the towns, or even on the beaches if they like. You definitely have to watch where you step, no matter where you happen to be walking! It’s a bit sad, however, because, since the cows are sacred and believed to be cared for and protected by the gods, no one feeds or takes care of them; therefore, there are a good many very thin, unhealthy cows roaming about eating trash or whatever they can find. While in Gokarna, we actually witnessed a cow fight, which I had never seen before. Interestingly, to break up the fight between these sacred animals, the townspeople began beating them with sticks. I suppose their intentions were in
Tourists by the water
the cows’ best interest, but it was somewhat difficult to watch.

As far as sightseeing goes, we spent one full day exploring nearby Kudlee Beach and Om Beach. We followed the trail from the town and reached the first beach in about half an hour. We then walked along the water until we reached the trail that led to Om Beach (which is actually shaped like an Om symbol). It was nice to find this beach to be far less crowded and touristy than Arambol. Additionally, there was a similar number of Indian visitors as westerners, which was a nice change. However, we did see the occasional westerner sporting a thong, as well as one man casually changing out of his bathing suit on the beach. Side note: never in my life have I been in a holy city and seen so many grown men walking the streets and beach in their underwear...granted, it's better than wearing a thong or going completely nude, but I can assure you that this practice of men strolling about in their skivvies is, well, simply not okay.

Anyway, as we walked to Om Beach, we met a Swedish gentleman who accompanied us
Such an amazing view
for much of the way. He was an interesting character, but nice to talk to. Once we got to the beach, we stopped for lunch and then decided to follow a trail we found along the cliffs next to the water. We found some amazing views of the surrounding landscape, but as we continued to follow the trail, it started to become less and less of a trail and increasingly more difficult to navigate. Despite our better judgment, we decided to keep on trekking since we’d already walked for a long time. At this point both Scott and I slid on loose rocks and fell – I was fine, but Scott bruised his rear end pretty badly. Still, we went on…

Eventually, Scott found what resembled a very overgrown trail through the jungle, and, after going ahead of me to check it out, he reported that it did in fact come out at our destination…if I was up for an adventurous, slightly cramped and questionably dangerous jungle hike. I figured I’d come this far, so I might as well give it a shot. Scott was right, though. We found ourselves ducking under branches and vines, attempting (and sometimes failing)
The landscape was incredible
to avoid thorns, climbing over rocks, walking across a very unstable “bridge” composed of intertwined vines and leaves, and basically trying not to get seriously injured. Luckily we made it out with a few scratches and minor sunburns, guzzled some celebratory water, and called it a day.

The following day, we walked around window shopping and ate lunch at a great little restaurant we found with generously portioned thalis and delicious homemade ice cream. Aside from that, we just waited for the 6:30 p.m. public bus that would transport us to Ankola, where we would then catch an overnight bus to Hampi.

As we waited, our wonderful hosts served us fresh papaya along with chai and cookies (which they didn’t charge us for) and sat down to talk with us for awhile. This was when I came upon the realization that they had assumed that I was Indian during our entire stay…something about my teeth, complexion, clothes, and, I’m assuming, my nose ring gave them this impression. They said that if I walked around in a sari and wore a bindi, there would be no question. I found this to be interesting, and, to be honest, took it
Om Beach
as a compliment since, by not standing out so much as a westerner, I felt that perhaps I was succeeding in respecting the local culture. This, of course, is not to say that being a westerner is a bad thing, but if you walk around in tank tops, booty shorts, bathing suits or worse in a country where it’s considered disrespectful to show your shoulders or knees (and anything in between), it doesn’t make a very good impression. Another reason I was surprised to be mistaken as an Indian in both Arambol and Gokarna was due to the fact that, in Mumbai and other cities, people from small villages viewed me as a novelty and wanted their picture made with me because I’m white…funny, isn’t it?

When the time came, we said goodbye to our hosts and thanked them for their hospitality, then took the short bus ride to Ankola where our sleeper bus was scheduled to arrive at 11:00 p.m. We got to the bus stop (a skuzzy old hotel) early, ate some dinner and read for a few hours, but when 11:00 rolled around, our bus was nowhere to be found. We figured it was just running
A cow catching some rays
late, but, as the hours passed, we began to acknowledge that it may not be coming. The people working at the station laughed our situation off, saying “This is India” every time we inquired about our bus. Eventually, at 2:00 a.m. a bus from the company we’d booked with arrived, but, since it wasn’t a sleeper, we assumed it wasn’t ours. We were wrong. Apparently something had happened to the bus we’d booked (and paid handsomely for), and our option was to take the seater bus or nothing. So, after a cramped, sleepless night sitting next to a snorer who had night terrors, we arrived in Hampi with no explanation or promise of a refund… All part of the adventure, right? On the bright side, we thoroughly enjoyed our time in Gokarna, and as you’ll soon find out, the trip to Hampi, as frustrating and tiresome as it may have been, was well worth it.

February 6th 2013
Published: February 6th 2013


Friday 1 February – Saturday 2 February

There is not really much to say about the 1st and 2nd of February except that we are all really sad to have come to the end of this fantastic experience. We have been back in Mangalore, definitely my favourite place in India. We flew to Mumbai to get our flight to Heathrow and have noticed the biggest slum I have ever seen directly beside the runway in Mumbai, covering three sides of the airport perimeter. We didn’t see anything like this in Karnataka. We can see kids playing cricket, houses stacked on top of each other, yet most of them have satellite dishes, and I’m wondering how they ever have any privacy or ever protect their belongings? As our flight is delayed by two hours, due to a technical fault, and we are more than likely to miss our connecting flight to Manchester, now that we have take full advantage of the British Airways hospitality, I suppose it would be a good time to sum up my month in Karnataka…..

I have been making notes throughout the month about the things that have surprised or intrigued me the most about India. I say India loosely as I am now well aware that South India is so different to North India. We have only discovered one very small part of India and maybe one day I can visit the North to find out the differences in culture. So, in no particular order, these are my thoughts:

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Indian Standard Time
Even before I arrived in India, I had read about IST. It’s know as Indian Standard Time (Like GMT) but widely known as Indian Stretchable Time. The Indian’s themselves will admit that they have no real concept of time and if they say they will be there at 8am it will be 9am before they arrive. It gives the country a relaxed feel but it’s hard for us British to adapt. At home, I’m very punctual and always like to be early for appointments. By the end of the trip I have adapted and when somebody says ‘be ready for breakfast at 8am’, I take at least an extra 20 minutes to wash and dry my hair and put some make up on. Even then, in some homes I have time for a tour and a look at the photo albums before breakfast is served!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Driving
I have mentioned the traffic and driving skills a few times in the blog already and Emily has also added a whole post dedicated to the transport here. I don’t know what else to say except it has to be seen to be believed! I tried to take a few videos but even they don’t capture the bedlam of the road system. I can’t see any logic except ‘only the strong and brave survive’! At home we wait to get onto a roundabout. Here, we all pile onto the roundabout and then toot at each other to get off the roundabout. Our driver Nagaraj is great and the only time we have felt a bit worried was when we say other vehicles heading straight towards us on a bend. Although they drive on the same side of the road as us, I challenge any British person to drive here. Good luck! It will take a very brave person!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Religion
Before I went to India, I’m quite ashamed to admit that I was not really familiar with the various religions which I would come across. Between us, we stayed with Hindu, Muslim and Christian families during our month in Karnataka. We also visited various churches and Hindu and Jain temples. We could regularly hear the prayers and chanting coming from Muslim mosques. We commented on the final day that we couldn’t capture this sound to let others experience it. Anybody who has been to Turkey will to doubt be familiar with it. Having spent a month here, asking endless questions and watching the various different styles of worship, I can admit that although I have learned a lot, I will never fully understand these religions. They are complex and fascinating and having 30,000 Hindu idols is something I can’t get my head around. I don’t know how the Indian people get their head around this. What I did like was their passion and dedication. Their beliefs are admirable and I am almost feel that I am missing out by not having such beliefs. Personally, I am not religious. I have never been christened and I never plan to get married in a Church. The majority of my friends are the same. It’s very hard for Indian people to understand this. One woman actually told me that I had lost my faith and I need to learn to believe again. At the time I was quite upset by this. It is a surprise for people here to learn that the majority of people in the UK don’t go to Church every Sunday. One nice aspect of the religion here was that we all got involved in the Hindu style of worship. All of the Hindu families I stayed with had a pooja room, or at least a visible shine which they worship every day. In one home, the wife hit a very large symbol in the early morning and late at night while the husband carried out the candle lighting and praying rituals. When they asked me to join in, they were surprised that I knew what to do with the holy water and the candle. However, as I was almost at the end of the trip, it would have been impossible for me not to know what to do when they asked me to get involved ion their prayers.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Hand holding
I don’t think I will ever get used to seeing men being so affectionate to each other. During my time here, I have not seen any two Indian women holding hands or even being truly affectionate to each other (although I regularly hug the women). At least three times I day I have seen Indian men, from young boys to middle aged men holding hands as they walk down the beach, chat at a Rotary meeting or walk down a busy street. It is completely normal here and is by no means a sign of their sexuality. I picked up a copy of a weekly magazine here and read a sex survey which was quite revealing and openly states that homosexuality is still completely frowned upon in India. Yet, if we saw this kind of hand holding at home we would automatically assume that these people were gay. There is nothing at all wrong with this practice, yet it does seem so unfamiliar to us. Only in Ibiza have I seen anything similar! I asked one of my hosts about how common it was for young heterosexual couples to hold hands or show each other affection (I had seen it at the mall and was shocked) and he said that although youngsters were doing it, it was not readily accepted in India.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Being a minority
I had never expected that when I came to India that I would be classed as a minority. I think that I expected to be going to areas where they receive a lot of international tourists and are used to seeing white faces. However, on more than one occasion we were stared at, laughed at and asked for photos. To start with, we obliged, particularly for the under tens. However, when it was day 20 and grown adults were pointing at us and making us stand for photo after photo, it got to a point where we were fed up. Even in a temple, we were approached about five times to have photos taken. It made our visits less enjoyable but more than anything it made us realise that this is perhaps how minorities feel in our own country. In the UK we are becoming much more tolerant. However, in the North, particularly Cumbria, it is rare to see a face which is not White British. Although most people are accepting of another colour or race, a minority of uneducated people are still very racist.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Superficial things versus family values
Most of the hosts we have lived with had lovely homes, beautiful silks and a nice lifestyle. However, superficial things in India don’t seem to be so important. At home, people take credit to furnish their homes with beautiful furniture and go on nice holidays. Something we learned from the families here is that money should be saved for the future, even if it’s just a little each month. The most important things in life are health, education, family and happiness. I think all Westerners could learn a lesson from this.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Friendly and hospitable people
One of the first things that we were told when we arrived in Indi is that the ‘Guest is God’ and Indian people look after their guests well. I can’t dispute this fact and I can honestly say that I have never received such hospitality before. We were looked after, cared for, and more importantly, welcomed into the family and made to feel like an old friend. I only hope that the hosts in the UK can live up to this when they welcome the Indian GSE team. It wasn’t just in the home though as every person we came across welcomed us and showed a real interest in finding out about us. They happily answered our questions about culture, family and foo. They even made their food a little less spicy to help us along!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Importance of education
Parents and students alike place a lot of emphasis on the importance of education. In many cases, they are paying for private education as the Government run schools are not up to scratch. In every school or university we visited, the students seemed genuinely happy to be there, to be learning and to have opportunities opened up to them. We only stayed with middle class families but from what I could see, this was consistent across the classes. Even the children of the lower classes are now educated ad they have aspirations much higher than their parents. Sadly, I don’t think that education is rated so highly in the UK. Perhaps people take school education for granted as it is free here?

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Personal manners
Without offending anybody in India, I have to mention manners and the frequency of spitting, burping and going to the toilet in the street. I have lost count of the number of men I have seen going to the toilet in the street. Sadly, I have to say that I also saw a small child squatting in the street in one town. Yes, we see this at home on occasion. But here, it’s as regular as saying hello! Weeing in the street is a huge problem here. In some places the authorities have started to paint idols on the pavements and walls to prevent people going to the toilet there. The real problem is a lack of public facilities. Even those which are available are unhygienic or you have to pay to use them. To us, it’s a small price. To an Indian working on the roadside selling tender coconut, it’s not always possible to pay to go the toilet. When it comes to manners……. At the airport, in shops, at the temple, in restaurants, people are burping, sniffing, snorting. Even when they see us looking at them with shock, they ignore it. People are constantly spitting, including women, yet nobody bats an eyelid!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Mobile phones
Can anybody in the UK remember what life was like when they bought their first mobile phone? You had a loud ringtone and you were so pleased to have a phone that you answered it in very public places just so that people knew you had one. That was maybe 15 years ago. That is what life is like in India. At every Rotary meeting we have been at, people keep their phone turned on, it rings loudly, at least once an hour, and they answer it, no matter what they are doing. Many a time we have been presenting and people have sat in the audience, taking loudly on their phone. If their phone isn’t ringing, they are talking to whoever is sitting next to them, again loudly. To us sensible and polite Brits this is complete and utter rudeness. To Indian people this everyday life. Nobody is offended. In fact, nobody cares!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Extreme wealth to poverty
A lot of people said that we had not seen ‘real India’ because we were in a relatively wealthy part of the country. However, as with every place, there are rich people and there are poor people. It was quite shocking at times to see some of the poorer people, particularly the young girls begging near tourist attractions. At times it seemed like the Indian people are quite oblivious to the poverty in their area. However, I imagine that other parts of India see much worse poverty and we would have to travel further afield to see genuine poverty. When we landed in Mumbai on the way home, we thought we had seen poverty when we saw the slum which was right beside the perimeter fence. Then you see that almost every house has a satellite dish!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Loss of control
Talking amongst ourselves, we have all said that our biggest struggle is not having any control over time, food and schedule. All of us are independent people with full time jobs, mortgages and in some cases family. While we have really enjoyed this trip, it has been hard to answer to other people all of the time. They dictate our activities, they tell us when to take rest, when to each, how much to eat, what activities we will do. The downside of this is that I can’t seem to make my own decisions anymore. On the last day we had a menu put in front of us and I asked Devdas to order my food. I even accidently locked myself in my room and didn’t think I could make it out without help. Not sure how I’m going to cope living alone again!

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Personal circumstances
Explaining our personal circumstances in India has been difficult. None of us, from the four team members, to the team leader, have a traditional set up with a husband and children. All of us are aged over 26 so to the Indians, this is strange. Ideally, we would all be married and have a child, or at least be planning a family. On more than one occasion people have tried to find me a husband, from their son to their cousin to their nephew who lives in London. They also can’t understand that I live alone. Ideally, I should live with my parents (who are divorced), my unmarried brother and also my married brother and his wife and two children. We would need a very big house! One of my hosts actually told me that under no circumstances would he ever ever let his unmarried daughter live alone, let alone 30 miles from the family home. I have to accept his opinion. Maybe one day he can come to the UK and see that I can manage fine alone, working full time, managing a house, bills and life alone.

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Maids and help in the home
Many of families I lived with had a full time live in maid or at least one or two staff who visited daily to clean for them. One woman was amazed to learn that my brother and his wife both work full time, have two children and no maid! ‘How do they cope?’ ‘How do they look after their children?’ ‘How do they find the time to cook and clean?’ I was actually quite shocked by this. At home, couples know what they are taking on when they have a family. They know it will be expensive and they know they have to work. They are grateful for support from their extended family. We couldn’t contemplate having staff, not least because we couldn’t afford it! In India, they can’t imagine life without staff. Yes, the women here work hard looking after their family and preparing meals from scratch. But I challenge them to work full time and then come home to cook and clean and pay bills (And that isn’t even taking into account looking after the children!).

<strong style=""mso-bidi-font-weight: normal;"">Treatment of women
One thing which I found quite hard to witness was the treatment of some women. In India, it is completely normal for wives to run around after their husbands, eat their meals after the rest of the family, and serve food to everybody, even if they are quite capable of helping themselves. In the factories, many en supervised groups of women who were doing hard annual labour. One person actually told us that women were not capable of being supervisors! At home, women are taught to be quite independent, and more and more men now help around the home too, cooking, cleaning, parental responsibilities. Both systems have their pros and cons I’m sure, but I personally prefer ours!

Overall, we have been very lucky to have been chosen to be part of this GSE team. People would give anything to have the opportunity and see the things that we have seen. Devdas said that we have seen more in one month than he has seen in his lifetime. It is an experience we will remember forever.

Devdas, Rekah, Ramkrishna and Nagaraj all waved us away from Managlore airport and both me and Nicola later admitted that we were crying. Nicola because she would miss her hosts Devdas and Rekah and me because I really want to stay. Devdas did say that he would turn a blind eye if I didn’t want to get on the plane. He also said I was more than welcome to stay at his house but I’m sure he would live to regret that!

You can probably tell from the tone of the final blog that I really don’t want to leave. Although I have missed everybody at home, I could easily stay another month or two. Although, I’d like to maybe use some of my vocational skills out here and work with organisations to help them deliver their communications or Corporate Social Responsibility projects. The GSE trip has been a great experience but it’s time to start doing some work before I forget how to!

Rajendra and Janhavi have already phoned me and Nicola to ask us to come back to Belur or to visit their apartment in Bangalore, a place we haven’t been. Other fiends we have made have also asked us to comeback and it’s clear that they are 100%!g(MISSING)enuine and can’t wait to see us all again. The nice thing is that all four of us have had a very individual experience because we lived with different families. We will never run out of things to talk about and we will all stay in touch too. So if I’m not e-mailing or texting the girls, I will be e-mailing, whatsapping or hopefully visiting my friends in India.

Although I was nervous before I came, for many different reasons, I can say that I have had the best time ever and I am so grateful for this experience. If we had visited Karnataka and stayed in hotels it would have been a nice holiday but living with Rotarians and their families has made this experience extra special for every one of us. Yes, it was challenging but it has been worth it, both personally and professionally.

You can expect to see me in India again very very soon! (Maybe not in the monsoon!)

V noci som sa na komarov zobudil len raz,dalsi raz som sa zobudil na zimu a asi 3x na bordel co tu robili indovia. Totalne nahlas sa medzi sebou rozpravali,uplne kricali. Okolo 4/00 zacali chodit na hajzel,ocul som len same grcanie alebo co to bolo za zvuky. Nabuduce si radsej priplatim a ziadne byvanie s indami.

Z postele som vypadol okolo 8/00,zastavil sa na plackove ranajky a siel cca 3,5km po ceste k juznym chramom. Da sa tu pozicat aj motorka resp.vo velkom tu turisti chodia na bicykloch ale to ma nelakalo. Vsetko je to fajn dostupne pesi,teda ak to clovek nechce obehnut za jeden den.

Chramy v podstate to iste co vcera,zrucaniny,prach,skaly a jeden plateny areal. Ten som opat nenavstivil,i ked tu uz bolo vidiet indicke jednanie,straznik ma chcel pustit dnu za 100rupii,inak listok 250 a pre miestnych za 10rupii. Chramov mi uz v indii stacilo.

Pri jednom ma chytila sracka,tak som sa skoval za skalu a spravil to ako rodeny ind.

Uz si ani nelamem hlavu s odpadom,proste hodim bordel na zem a idem dalej.

V jednom chrame bolo podzemne mesto,spristupnena bola iba jedna mini chodba,ostatne zavalene,skoda.

Cestou nazad som sa osviezil kokosom,tento stal len 15rup,no nist musim opat zacat zjednavat aj o jedlo.

Kukol som este chram s velkou sochou slona,pri ktorom sa vsetci fotili a siel sa skovat pred peklom co bolo vonku do ubytka.

Cestou od slonieho chramu ma prenasledoval indicky soplak (asi 8.rokov) a chcel mi predat pohladnice.Jasne som mu hovoril,ze nemam zaujem,furt otravoval,isol se mnu zhruba 300m a potom to konecne vzdal. Takychto detskych predavacov je tu kopa.

V ubytku som sa odvazil dat sprchu,zbalil sa a pospal si.

Potom som od domacej zistil co stoji vlastne ananas. Velky som kupil za 50 rupii,v skutocnosti stoji 30rupii,este musim zistit pokolko su mandarinky.

Po prieskume vychodu a juhu mi ostaval uz len sever a zapad hampi. Na sever som sa nechystal,treba sa tam preplavit lodkou a su tam len ubytka a restiky. Ubytka su tam vraj lacnejsie a lepsie,len sa tam treba dostat cez rieku lodkou a ta po istom case je strasne draha,tusim po 18/00 za prevoz chcu 150 rupi ,inak 10 rupii.

Tak som siel na zapad,tam tiez nic neni iba fajn vyhlad na rieku. Na ceste kopa predavacov suvenirov a bananov. Zbadal som sipku k mango tree restike. Niekde som o nej cital,len som si nevedel spomenut ci v dobrom abo zlom,tak som to siel preskumat. Presiel som bananovnikovym sadmi a dostal sa do ciela. Sok,milion turistov,noreku uz nevadi,zapadnem sem,uz som bol i tak hladny. Vyzul som sa a sadol si na zem k stolu. Fajnovy vyhlad bol odtialto na rieku. Kukol som menu,riadne palky za jedlo,dosol ku mne casnik a povedal mi nech sa presunem k druhemu stolu,bo sem idu cedok turisty,ok,presunul som sa.Potom zas dosol,ze nech sa presunem k dalsiemu,ze ma dalsiu velkugrupu. To som sa uz nasral a isol prec odtial. Fakt tuto restiku neodporucam,je to tu drahe,milion ludi, nahovno jedlo (to som zistili neskor od jednej baby) a drbnuta obsluha.

Cestou nazad som si odychol pri pristave (no ani nie pristav len male clnky tu parkuju a prepravuju ludi na druhu stranu). Indovia susili veci na zemi ale to ma az tak nezaujalo.Zaujal ma jeden biely par co sa snazil dostat cez rieku. Chceli ju prebrodit,zrejme nechceli dat zarobit vydieracskym prepravcom na clnkoch. Snazili sa ,snazili ale nedarilo sa im to,isli cez dost hlboku vodu a silny prud. Indovia sa na nich riadne zabavali az sa jeden zlutoval a nasmeroval ich na relativnu plytcinu. Nakonec to dokazali.

Vcera ako som bol na zapade slnka,som tam spozoroval jedneho chalana s velkym batohom,mal na nom rozne vlajocky krajin co navstivil. Videl som tam cesku a chorvatsku zastavu. Tak reku konecne s volakym pokecam. Pytam sa ci je cech abo chorvat a ukazujem mu na vlajocky. Hned na mna spatno kukol,som srb,to nie je chorvatsko.A potom uz len podrazdenym tonom odpovedal na mojich par otazok. Debil nacionalisticky,clovek sa ho normalne opyta ked vidi na batohu vlajocky ,logicky mi to vychadzalo na to,ze je bud odtial abo odtial. No nist teda.

Zatial som fakt nestretol ziadnych normalnych turistov,som zvedavy co ma caka v Goa.

Musim si kupit tu ziletku,uz ma to zacina svrbet.

Suveniry nakupim az Dili,sa mi to nechce nosit v batohu.

Konecne som spojazdil zastrcku na izbe,zas bolo treba zapnut specialny vypinac mimo izbu.

Na vecer som bol kuknut zapad slnka,dnes bol lepsi. Ako som siel na kopec a mal som v rukach banany,jeden mi spadol na zem.To chcela vyuzit jedna opica a uchmatnut mi ho,no bol som rychlejsi,ale ta spina potom do mna skocila,vycerila zuby a stiahla sa nazad,bo uz zbadala dalsich ludi s bananmi,ti ich im davali.

Zajtra v plane odchod do Hospitu okolo 9/00,tam kuknutie mesta,zabezpecenie busu do goa.hadam ten statny pojde. Tu predavaju normalne sukromne ale vsetko len sleeperi,to veru nechcem.

Na ubytku som planoval turecko,asi dam len volaku trasu podla LP a nebudem spekulovat. Kukal som letenky tie su dost lacne domov,resp vijdu tolko co vlak/bus. Este rozmyslam ak zuzana nedojde za mnu do istanbulu,ze by som letel do sarajeva a odtial siel domov. Ale to zalezi od toho ci tam bude futbal.

V noci som nemohl opat spat,uz sa tesim na zajtrajsi 24 hodinovy presun.

Po zobudeni a neumyti sa. Sak som v Indii netreba. Som siel na miestny mini trh na rananky. Dal som si placky s omackou,stretol som tu aj mojich susedov ale len zeny,tie ang nevedeli.

Z ranajok som sa musel vratit na ubytko vymenit si obuv. Slapky ma moc oskierali tak som nahodil botasky. Zla kupa teda,toto su skor len take plazove slapky,v goa asi kupim neake lepsie.

Tak a mohla zacat moja put po chramoch za pekneho slnecneho pocasia. Prvy sa na radu dostal blizky chram Virupaksha,vstupne bolo 2rup,za fotak chceli 50 rup. Pred vstupom do tohto dost velkeho komplexu sa bolo treba vyzut. Botasky som si odlozil tam kde vsetci,na zem k stene. Pytam sa chalpika ci to je gratis,vraj hej,len dobrovolny poplatok ak niekot chce. Chram ma moc neoslnil. Predomnou bola daka skolska vypprava tak ma dost brzdili najskor ale nakonec som sa ich striasol. V jednej miestnosti ma chceli oznackovat cervenou bodkou na celo,to som odmietol a pratal sa radsej inde. Dostal som sa k dakej vodnej nadrzi,tam zistene,ze sa da dostat do tohto chramu aj zdarma ale zas 2 rupie su neni moc. Spravil som par mobilovych fotiek,zrejme si ma straznik vsimol,chcel aby som zaplatil poplatok za fotak.Tak som mu ukaz batoh,ze nech si prekutre,ze ja fotak nemam. To odmietol a pustil ma von. Obul som si botasky,dosol vyberac,ze mam zaplatit za strazenie topanok,hovorim,ze to je dobrovolne,ukazuje mi tabulu a tam je fakt napisane,uskladnenie za poplatok. Platili vsetci aj domaci tak som zaplatil nech neotravuje. Indovia su vacsi ojebavaci nez vietnamci,musim si na nich davat vacsi pozor.

Odtialto som siel omrknut hned kopec co je po lavej strane tohto chramu. Na nom je kopa zrucanin a fajnovy vyhlad na okolie.Zrucaniny mi pripominaly grecke stavby.

Jeden kopec mi nestacil tak som vyliezol na Matanga hill. Vystup nebol narocny,z vrcholu bol este lepsi vyhlad nez z toho prveho kopca. Zliezol som dole,ocitol som sa v Achutaray chrame,trocha som ho preskumal a vybral sa k hlavnemu dnesnemu bodu vithalla templu. Slnko uz fakt pripekalo,nebolo sa sa kde skovat,sama vyprahnuta krajina. Cestou kopa dalsich fajnovych chramov.

Vithalla chram bol spoplatneny,domaci za 10 rup ,cudzinci za 250rup,tak som sa na nich vysral,nebudem platit niekolkonasobne vyssie vstupne ako domaci. Este mi pokladnik ukazoval rozne obrazky z chramu,ze nech tam len idem,ze to je fajnove. No kedze som neni velky nadsenec umenia vyprdol som sa mu na to. Stacia mi chrami co su po okoli a tych je tu fakt kopa a su zdarma.

Tu som si kupil nanuk,bo som uz fakt skapinal od tepla. Zjednane z 25rup na 20rup,po zjedeny a prestudovany obalu stoji normalne 15 rup. No nist teda.

Nazad do ubytka som si dal kokos,kukol ako sa ludia vozia na kruhovych lodkach na druhy breh,dokupil banany a siel si pospat na ubytko. Fakt ma to chodenie po mega slnku a mega teplu vycerpalo

Zistene,ze v Cochin ma dobre natiahli pri kupe bananov,za 3 som platil 15 rup, tu za 5 len 10 rup.

Spravil som mierny prieskum netu,1 hodina za 40 rupii,to je fakt palka. Je tu kopa indickych turistov a samozrejme nesmiu chybat aj daky sikmooky a vsade pritomny rusi. Osadenstvo vacsinou hipisaci,nezavislaci a rozne ine individua co sa hraju na indov.

Po dvojhodinovom spanku,ktory by trval isto dlhsie,len ma moji susedia zobudili,bo odchadzali do dalsieho mesta,som sa s nimi rozlucil. Chalan povedal,ze sa isto este stretneme a ked nie my,tak nasi potomkovia urcite 😊 Dal mi svoje tel.cislo,ja som mu dal moj email ale to nevedel co je,mu to vysvetloval dalsi jeho clen rodiny. Fajn rodinka,prve pozitivum z indie.Ak teda este nepocitam toho inda z busu.

Neskor som sa vydal na sunset point kuknut zapad slnka. Uz tu bola kopa ludi a opice. Zapad nic moc,najlepsi bol v laose na don det.

Potom uz len dopisovanie dennika,ucenie sa ang a spanok.

February 2nd 2013
Published: February 7th 2013


Early morning over the rice paddies.
There's nothing intimate about Indian cities. Surely it's here that that well worn cliche ""assault on the senses"" was spawned. Urban India is where the concept of a billion people in one nation resonates.

The gamy odours of raw filth that overlay the spicy aromas of street cuisine. The incessant rhythmic honking of car horns. Mosque wake up calls (there may only be a 10% Muslim population here but that's still 100 million). Mainlining vegetarian curries. Cows knee deep in street rubbish somehow eking out an alternate food source to grass. It's dank, it's full throttle and maybe it's not the Indian romance of imaginations or from the pages of Rudyard Kipling, but the lurching excitement of Mysore, Bangalore and Hyderabad has left a thousand still-life images entrenched in the memory banks.

No more so than the mayhem of their markets. The atmosphere is pure earth but the colours, noise and smells are brutally left field from Woolworths, Carrefour or Walmart. (Ok, maybe not Walmart).

Far from there being a stampede of tourists, ourselves and the few westerners we stumbled across in these markets would stroll around bug-eyed and rattle off a few frames while the locals gawk
Mysore market
back and wonder what this tourist fuss is all about. We wallow in the good, the bad and the ugly of this otherworldly environment but from a native perspective this is simply their day in day out rota and a struggle to disinfect themselves from a breadline existence. The implication of some of their looks was;

""You find this so interesting, how about we swap"".

You don't need to do too much soul searching to understand their frustration at the inequities. The roles we had fallen into we're primarily an accident of birth.

The most ambitious guy was the bloke with the table full of second hand dentures. I didn't know who to feel most sorry for;

- the vendor himself trying to find customers in the narrow market of used teeth.

- the people who had been forced to sell him their choppers, or

- those who might be actually tempted to purchase a set of fangs that had already spent a deal of time inside someone else's mouth. I assume this group would also need to try quite a few sets before finally settling on the ones with juuuuust the right fit.
The Guru's guru! Hampi Bazaar.


The mind boggles.

As character building as those cities were, only a martyr would visit all three consecutively without trying to shoehorn some recovery time in the midst.

Hampi, tucked into the middle of Karnataka, has been long esconsed on the hippy tourist trail in India and looked a worthy stop for a few days. We should have made it longer.

Verdant rice paddies are lined by a landscape of hanging boulders that balance like a set of fiddle sticks that cling on through sheer self belief. A creek meanders amongst and the entire region is peppered with Hindu places of worship.

The backpacker demographic holds court here, as if a force field exists to keep large hotel chains and anything else remotely upmarket at arms length from this world heritage area.

Naturally, with such a majority of shoestring clientele there's no shortage of westerners who have converted to overnight gurus. The guy with the stick-on dreadlock business must be doing pretty well for himself in Hampi.

With time on your hands, days could easily turn into weeks in this little oasis about as far removed from the Indian maelstrom as can be
Mysore market
The live version in cages could see these guys 2 metres away.
imagined.


Monkeys - I'm not a fan.


Anybody out there with an aversion to gutter rhetoric, please tune out now. As for the rest of you ......

It was one of those lower depth days when you search for some self justification for this travelling gig. Caught off guard, India launched a jack-in-the-box attack and went for the jugular.

It's only 150 klms from Wayanad to Mysore but 3 tuk tuks, 2 buses, 5 hours and 20 lineal klms down, the 130 to go may as well have been to the moon given our chances of getting there.

That ubiquitous say it all yet say nothing Indian head wobble had lost all its exotic gloss in the hours of mis-communication;

""Bus coming sir. Bus not coming sir. Bus being late sir. Bus being full sir. Please go to other bus station sir"".

The prospect of ""bus not bloody existing sir"" weighed heavily.

Penny wandered off to the public ladies for a touch of aromatic ""eau de India"" whilst I sat on a crumpled iron bench at the bus stop of this dusty frontier town and no escape plan. I needed a
Maharaja Palace Mysore
sign.

Right on cue, up sauntered a monkey. Totally at ease with his position in the primate pecking order, he sat down 3 metres in front, stared directly into my eyes with a look of teenage disdain and began masturbating, as if he recognised a human hangdog expression and was up for rubbing some salt into wounds.This wasn't the message from above I had anticipated.

I wasn't sure whether to;

(a) Walk over and spoil the guy's romance by swinging my number 11 foot in his general direction, or

(b) Go and buy him a cigarette to help him enjoy his moment of post self-gratification.

Either way, it's now official. I don't like monkeys.

India, you won that round.

The white collar hippie



What is it with India that turns the most conservative, short back and sides, neat as a pin, designer clothes wearing westerner to turn hippie within a matter of days of arriving?

After leaving Kerala we travelled to Mysore, Bangalore, Hampi and finally to Hyderabad to conclude our Indian experience ( this time... does that mean we might be back)?

I
Bangalore Market
really have enjoyed India this time round despite us both getting sick here on our last few days. I think we jinxed ourselves as I had only just finished bragging to a German couple that; ""we had not been sick all year"". But having fallen ill, Hampi was probably a good place to just watch the world go by for a few days and let the bug do its thing.

So I sat in my hammock, trying not to let it swing in case it made me nauseous and watched and pondered on the new breed of white collar hippies we had encountered along the way to actually see the final transformation in Hampi.

First they arrive sporting their corporate hair cuts, neatly shaven, wearing their designer label clothing and looking every bit the tourist. Within a few days a dreadlock is woven into the short strands of hair, their designer clothes are gradually being swapped for haram pants, Indian shirts and the odd headband. By this stage they have a healthy collection of string wristbands and anklets, and occasionally sporting a red dot in the middle of their forehead. Not long after this, the shoes disappear and
Hampi school kids
they can handle the rugged dirty garbage ridden streets and lane-ways barefoot. All that is required now is some body piercing to complete the picture.

By the time they reach Hampi, many more dreadlocks have been added, no doubt from the trade-in of their western sandals. They look thinner and more gaunt, ahh but they haven't been sick they claim, they have thrown away knives and forks, they can eat with there hands and eat rice and curry once a day and survive on bananas every other meal.

Hampi is an interesting town, a place that has a great history, UNESCO sites, the most beautiful rice paddies amongst elephant size boulders. A small stream dividing the very hippie from the up and coming hippie town. The temple elephant comes to the stream each day to be washed by the tourists and to bless them for their efforts. At sunset you can climb any number of boulders to a temple and sit overlooking the town below. This is where the white collar hippies turn pro. In this tranquil setting, ( apart from 50+ westerners) young kids come selling chai, the ""seasoned hippies"" offer tattoo services, and the white colllar
Anengundi. Sleeping baby in a sling.
hippies compare notes on their resent additions, be it makeup, more dreads etc etc.

So where to from here? How long after leaving India, do the dreadlocks get cut off, their feet get scrubbed and the Indian clothes get tossed? I guess I'll check it out at the airport tomorrow.

Hong Kong here we come.

Do Bangalore sme dorazili o 7/00,takze po 14-hodinach jazdy.

Hned po vystupeni sa na mna vrhli riksaci,ktorych som odignoroval. Pobral som sa pesibusom na dalsiu bus stanicu vzdialenu cca 5km odkial chodia busy do Hospetu. Bus stanica sa nachadza pri zel.stanici.

Cestou som zle odbocil a ocitol sa v botanickej zahrade. Dost ludi tu cvicilo a behalo. Moc som tu nepobudol,bo mi bola strasna zima. Som si musel dat na seba aj tricko s dlhym rukavom.

Po tom ako mi naskocila navigacia som sa uz v pohode dostal na bus stanicu.

Toto mesto mi ukazalo uz pravu tvar Indie. Vsade po ceste kravy,tony odpadkov a milion ludi a samozrejme drbkovci co furt trubili. Cochin bol oproti tomuto prechadzka ruzovou zahradou.

Jedlo som odkladal na neskor,co bola chyba,bo po dorazeni na bus stanicu akurat moj spoj vyrazal. Uplne stara kraksna bez klimy,sedacky (lavice) robene pre trpaslikov,ledvaj som sa tam napratal. Cesta do hsopetu trvala cca 9.hodin. Komplet cestu z bangalore do Hospetu som absolvoval iba ja. Vacsina ludi sa presuval len medzi dedinkami max.2 zastavky.

Krajina vokol bola uplne vyprahnuta,same kozy a neskutocny bordel.

Kusok pred cielom si ku mne sadol mlady ind,furt volaco mlel ale moc som ho nevnimal,bol som uplne k.o. Na jednej obcerstvovacej zastavke mi dal okostovat tu ich mini kavu,fajn. V buse mi do notesa pisal rozne jedla co mam okostovat.

Po dorazeny do Hospetu zas otravny nadhanaci,ponukali mi riksu a ubytku v hampi,vsetko mega predrazene.

Na bus stanici som zisitl kolko stoji statny bus do Goa ,450 rupii a vyraza o 20/00,listok sa neda kupit dopredu. Hadam ho teda zozenem v den odchodu.

Po obhliadke mesta z busu som sa rozhodol,ze v Hospete (totalna diera,neskor zistene,ze takto vyzeraju skoro vsetky mesta v indii) nezostanem ale idem priamo do turistickeho Hampi.

Na bus stanici som nastupil na statny bus a uz sa viezol do Hampi. Konkudor mi nemal vidat 3 rupie,tak mi na listok napisal 3 a mam si ich vypytat ked budem vystupovat.

Cestou bolo vidiet kopa starych chramov,fakt parada.

Po pol hodine sme dorazili do Hampi,od konkudora som si vypytal 3 rupie,ten mi ich s nevolou dal.

Opat nadhanaci,takyto otravny veru neboli v ziadnej krajine.Tak som s jednym isol nech ma radost,aspon ma doviedol do dediny vzdialenej asi 5 minut chodze od bus stanice.

Priviedol ma k jednej tetke ,izba s fanom,normal zachodom za 400 rup,zjednavat nechcela,vraj niektory tu zostavaju aj mesiac a nezjednavaju tak preco by mala dat mne lepsiu cenu ked tu chcem ostat len par noci. Tak nist teda,hned sa na mna vrhli dasli ludia co tu ponukaju ubytka (cela dedina je len o ubohych ubytkach) ale nikto nechcel dat lepsiu cenu. Potom ma zas volaky clovek odtiahol a ponukol za 285 rupi,po zlave. Prave indicke ubytko ale dako som to zvladol, nech mam na co aspon spominat. Mal som jednopostel s fanom,share wc a sprcha (len hadica,humus). Izba bola trochu vlhka,zlaty Central GH v BKK ,a samozrejme nesmeli chybat moji priatelia,komari.Vedla mna byvala indicka rodina.

Islo som najst dake jedlo,zapadol som v jednej restike (tich je tu tez kopa ale strasne ubohe a drahe),dal som si mega drahe jedlo co mi odporucal ind v buse. 2 placky,ryzu,1 special placku a 5 druhov omacky,to som zapil s bananovym sejkom. Na stene mal vycapeny napis,free wifi,tak pytam heslo a on ,ze treba za to zaplatit. Nasrat. Mobilny signal v tejto dedine neni. Kupil som tu este vodu a siel nazad na ubytko.

Problem,vonku tma ,same ulicky a ja som si ani za boha nemohol spomenut, ktora ulicka je moja. Takto som behal asi pol hodinu,kym som nakonec nasol moje zasite ubytko. Pred tym mi to trvalo asi 5 minut z ubytka do restiky.

Tu som sa dal do reci s indickou rodinou co tu byvala vedla mna. Chalan vsetko prekladal. Muzi su volaky mnisi alebo co,chodia po indii a navstevuju chramy. Cestuje s nimi cela familia od babky az po male deti. Obzeral si moju minibaterku,tak som mu ju daroval aj s pohladnicou. Ponukli ma kavou,fakt dobra,este sa tu na nu naucim.

Potom som sa isol osprchovat,nieco mi fut mleli o sprche ale nerozumel som im,po tom ako som sa osprchoval mi to docvaklo co mi to hovorili,sprchu pouzivali ako zachod. No parada teda,uz sa tu vac nesprchujem.

Potom uz len hovno spanok,furt komari,sprej nezabera ani tu. Nasol som tu tycinku proti komarom,to chvilu zaberalo ale ked vyhorela zas utocili. Inac v noci je tu dobra kosa.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Kundapura
January 31st 2013
Published: January 31st 2013


Embarking.
Well, it’s nearly the end of our fantastic journey around Karnataka. I think I can safely say for most of us that there’s still so much more to see here, we’d like to stay a little longer; some would stay a lot longer.

Yesterday we arrived in Kundapur, and are staying a hotel called Blue waters. The hotel is fantastic, very clean, and very beautiful. After we were checked in and shown around we were given a couple of hours to settle in and use the pool etc, needless to say we jumped on the wifi!

A little later, myself and Emily decided to go for a walk along the river and found a small boat yard where some men were making boats by stitching them together, sounds strange, and I couldn’t tell what they used to cover any holes but it was pretty impressive. We saw some of the boats on the river later and they were rather good.

Around 4:30pm we were taken on a boat to a small island in the river. We all had a little giggle that the boat man had to bail a bit of water out when we disembarked. I know
stitched boat.
there’s been lots of good food here but I didn’t realise we’d put that much weight on! On the other side of the island we could see where the river meets the ocean, and there was lots of little water wildlife to keep me happy, from birds to miniature crabs and flip flop trees!

As the boat left the island for the hotel docking point, we were happily gliding along the river, like a gondola, all sat with our life jackets on, and me, Tracy and Emily wondered how the fishermen reached their boats moored halfway out into the river...then we spotted a man walking near a boat and realise the water didn’t even reach his waist. Felt a bit daft sat there with our life jackets on but better safe than sorry!

In the evening we ate by the pool with Abhi, the hotel owner, and his wife and 2 children. We were served lots of tasty food and they were such good company even though the little one had a cold.

Today Abhi took us to see his Floriculture farm, they grow Orchids, Antheriums, Heliconia, Rubber trees, Areca nuts and have a few lodges in
Miniature crabs
the forest called Green woods, which would be brilliant for people who love nature, drawing, photography etc... They have made the lodges very rustic and have kept the landscape as natural as possible. The orchids were gorgeous and they gave us each a stem to take, shame it won’t make it home. The rubber trees were quite young and not ready to harvest for another 3 years. There were 2 men painting each tree with lime, this apparently helps keep the tree free of some diseases. I think we know the Heliconia called the bird of paradise plant mostly, but I didn’t realise there are actually over 100 varieties! A lot of their flowers are used in displays in hotels, but mainly they are sent to Goa, as they are in big demand there for festivals, weddings, gifts, offerings, etc.

When we left the Green woods, we visited a Nagar temple, which is a temple that is for the serpent. They feed about 4000 people every month at a festival held there. We learnt that people with skin problems come to the temple and roll on the floor around the idol and believe this will help to cure them.
orchids in mist spray.
Must be something connected to the shedding of the snake skin (good theory Emily!)

Back to hotel for lunch and then some of us may hide from the hottest part of the day. We have our final presentation tonight which is the marker for the end of our experience really. As much as I’m looking forward to boring everyone at home with all my stories about the things I have done, the places I’ve seen(I have a LOT of photos!), the amazing food that I’ve eaten, and the most welcoming, fantastic people I’ve met with every host I’ve been lucky to have, and the people who have taken us everywhere and looked after us every day, I would love to stay longer, but I’ll just have to start saving now so I can come back!

Lorry overloaded with water tanks
(thankfully empty!!!)
I couldn't be in India for a month and not write a big about the Indian road network!!! The best way to summarise is “expect the unexpected” and we've certainly seen our share of that during the past 4 weeks. From overloaded lorries to scooters with family of four on board we really have seen everything India has to offer. We've seen buses so overloaded with people standing in the aisle it's leaning heavily to one side, rickshaws with fridges hanging out of the back, scooters with water barrels on and many many more crazy sights!

2 wheelers are much more prevalent here in India and provide many people with affordable transport between towns and villages. Scooters are very popular for women to drive and motorbikes are parked outside most houses. Rickshaws are very common sight across the whole of India, operating as taxis, light goods vehicles and school transport.

Motorways under construction can take years to finish due to disputes over land ownership, which results in many ""diversions"" from the main highway on most routes between towns. A lot of people ignore these signs and stick to the unfinished part of the road anyway and then some people
traditional bullock cart
just drive down the wrong side of the main highway because the route is shorter! Our bus driver Nagaraj has looked after us tremendously well and doesn't take any chances when trying to overtake. He is always paying attention to the road ahead and despite the constant tooting from other drivers, refuses to overtake until the road is completely clear.

Millet thrashing on the main road is another strange practice we have observed on rural roads, where farmers put out in large piles and as the cars drive over the seeds are removed from their shells and the farmers collect these after a few hours. This practice is not recommended by the Government as it can cause damage to vehicles and pollute the crops with diesel.

Lorries here in India are very interesting and painted with very bright colours and interesting warning signs on the bumper! They carry everything from rocks to coffee and lots more! A lot of them are Ashok Leyland brand which have a UK subsidiary company called Optare which has recently shut down it's factory in Blackburn, Lancashire.

Here you will find a few photos collected on our travels and hope you enjoy!!!

Blue Waters
Wednesday 30 – Thursday 31 January 2013

I’m keeping this one short and sweet too as we are on the last leg of the trip and taking a little bit of time to relax and reflect on our time in India.

We have arrived in Kundapur and we are staying in a hotel, Blue Waters, owned by Abhinandan Shetty. Abhi has recognised that we are exhausted so we have a more relaxing itinerary for the next two days. This also gives us a chance to enjoy this beautiful resort, right next to the place where five rivers meet the Arabian Sea, and to catch up on some sleep.

Abhi has taken us on a boat trip to an island where we can see various wildlife, and also to his floriculture farm, his family temple and to his other resort, Green Woods, a secluded hideaway favoured by artists and creative types looking for some tranquillity in noisy and busy India. We were also able to share a nice meal with Abhi and his beautiful wife Neeta, as well as their two children. We got to know Neeta and daughter Ahana better when they took us to the beach too.
Our boat!


Kundapur is also our last presentation to a Rotary club. Staying in this beautiful resort almost makes you forget that you are in India. Then you go to a meeting in a rotary hall with a power cut and you have to present to a noisy audience by candlelight.

Blue Waters is certainly a hidden gem in Kundapur. I have asked Abhi how he markets his resorts and he is working solely on word of mouth. Locals and international guests are flocking here and it’s easy to see why. It really is quite different to anywhere we have stayed in India. I would recommend this place to anybody visiting Karnataka who wants a bit of luxury after staying in traditional £3 a night hotels and lodgings. Ashok, our resident cocktail waiter, the Tom Cruise of India, will make sure you are well looked after, and it’s just £50 a night! You wouldn’t get this at home!

How can we say goodbye to Karnataka? It feels like home!

Harish showing us round the farming training centre at Mysore
Providing training to farmers is often referred to as “extension services” and is often done through the same measures such as workshops, seminars and on-farm demonstrations. This is often carried out in India with public funds directly through Government staff, where the project I currently manage

Many people have asked me if there is a need to educate farmers in the UK when we have much higher rate of literacy and general increased level of awareness. Both UK and India need to communicate ideas and new technologies to farmers and it’s not always easy .

After talking with many different agriculturalists here in India I have found many similarities, despite the very different climate and geography. In the UK our average farm size is approx. 50ha which is much larger than India’s 2ha. Even with these differences in scale, I have learnt the farmers are actually similar. I have visited many farms in Karnataka, growing tropical crops we cannot grow in the UK, but the challenges are the same. Farms need to adapt an integrated system to provide a diverse income stream to allow for crops failing, drought or low market prices. This is something Indian farms are much
Karnataka Milk Federation
Members from the Shimogga office who kindly spent nearly 2 hours answering lots of my questions!!!
better at. In the UK all our markets are private and prices change daily, but India certain crops are controlled by Marketing Boards where prices are set for the whole year.

I have learnt a lot about the workings of the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF), both in Mangalore and Shimogga and made some very useful contacts who I will definitely keep in touch with. UK farmers are not terribly good at working in cooperation, but I strongly agree with Mhatma Ghandi’s vision “I firmly believe that we shall not derive the full benefits of agriculture until we take to cooperative farming”. Wise words indeed from 1947!!! Farmers can definitely create better market prices by working together, but it will take time.

On another vocational visit in Mangalore I visited the Karnataka State Government Department of Agriculture and I feel the policy structure here in India works much better than the UK. The subsidy programmes for farmers run for 12 months and uses information gained from the Taluks (villages), which feeds into the regional and state policy. This bottom-up process is much more effective and able to deliver positive results, unlike in the UK where our policy comes down
University of Agricultural Science (Bangalore)
from the top, firstly from the European Union and then national UK Government. This approach makes it hard for UK farmers to understand and accept messages and is one reason why the training and extension services provided through our project – Rural Skills Cumbria - is so important and why I enjoy my job.

In Mysore I visited another Karnakata State Government office, this time an Agricultural Training Centre and learnt how staff work very hard to promote courses to farms, using native language and many posters, so even illiterate people can learn. In the UK farmers are very busy people and leaving the farm for 2 or 3 days is very difficult. Karnataka State Government pays for accommodation, travel and expenses to help encourage attendance and perhaps we can learn from this in the UK.

My last vocational visit took place in Shimogga I visited the University of Agricultural Science, which I found really interesting and made some very useful contacts that I hope we can work on collaborative projects in the future. The meeting consisted of the Dean of Education, Head of Research, Extension Services, Organic Department and Soil Scientists. Some PhD and Masters students were also present and I asked them the question “Will you find agricultural jobs when you graduate?” None of the students plan to use their qualifications for rural jobs, but instead work in IT or Commerce. This was very disappointing for me and I think India and the UK need to encourage youth to stay in rural areas and provide job opportunities which benefit the whole community.

Our official Vocational visits are now over but we are constantly learning from the various Rotarians we meet. A lot of people in India come from agricultural families of some description and have a good knowledge of farming practices. The opportunity to meet so many people connected to my industry has been amazing and I am truly grateful to Rotary for this wonderful opportunity.

Bye for now!!! Emily

Well, Mangalore comference was definitely an experience, in many ways. We were told that over 3000people had registered at the conference when we arrived on friday! Yikes!
As soon as we got off the bus on friday, we were greeted by our old friend Devdas who has bern in touch with us throughout our trip. We arranged to meet at the conference hall that evening then went to unpack, what by now, are rather humongous suitcases!
It was great to see so many faces we recognised.(hello again to Dr.Hari A Shetty and family from Kushalnagar!) It was amazing how many people we recognised. After a lovely catch up and evening of cultural entertainment, we went back to the club for an early night and final preparations!
By saturday I was nervous about the presentation, lot of people watching, tv screens etc... while waiting to go on we were put on the big screen, just as Tracy was taking a nap!lol it rested my nerves so thanks Tracky!
Shouldnt have been worried. Presentation was good, quite enjoyed it. People clapped at my speech, which was lovely (thank you Rekha) I have been fascinated by the bond that families have here, and that they share such fantastic meals and I think we should bring this back in the UK!
After presentation we went for a deserved Lychee bacardi breezer and a bash on the karaoke!
Needless to say it was a late night Saturday and later morning Sunday. We made up for it with breakfast and brunch and an afternoon shopping!

Diane receiving rose at Rotary School funded by Shimogga East Club
Shimoga proved interesting, especially Wednesday, when we visited seven different places. The morning began with an elephant ride. Our hosts had heard that we hadn't been able to ride an elephant at the Dubare Camp, so kindly added an extra trip to make up for it. Elephants seem very tall from the ground, but once you climb the ladder and are placed on the howdah, it doesn't seem so bad and the animals move so gently, it's almost as if they want to look after you and give you a comfortable ride.

The summer palace was another interesting place to visit, with beautiful carved stone pieces, brought from many places,which were really attractive works of art. Then there was the tiger and lion safari. Again, we had failed to see tigers earlier on our tour, so it was a plus to be able to photograph some now.



Maybe, though, the best parts of the day were visiting four examples of the kind of projects Rotary clubs in Karnataka have been involved in. First there was a low cost housing initiative, where we saw four houses built with Rotary funding, in order to give rural workers a better
Affordable housing project funded by Rotary
home to live in. We worked out that each one had cost the equivalent of £750 to build. The owners were keen to show us around and to follow us round the village and be photographed with us. It was interesting to see a rural set up.



The next project was a blood bank, which was a new thing for me to see. I learnt a lot there, and now feel much more aware of how blood banks operate. Then there was a Rotary funded school, where we were asked to address a hall full of students, neither for the first nor the last time during our trip. Nicola was cursing me for dropping her into speaking off the cuff to the audience, but I was confident that she could do it well, and she did! Tracy was the one who was speaking when the awkward question came up about how sex education was imparted in Britain. In her usual form, she handled it perfectly. It's a very good team we have here for being able to speak to any audience on any subject which is thrown at them.



The fourth project was a residential school for the severest of mentally challenged people. Apparently these children are so difficult for poor rural parents to handle, that they tie them up all day, while they go to work. The state they are in when the parents return at the end of the day is appalling. The school manages to seek these children out and educate them in the most basic of things, such as cleanliness and toileting. It was a sobering visit for us all, but very good to see how much local Rotary clubs are managing to achieve.



After Shimogga we returned to Mangalore through beautiful countryside. This was the weekend of the District Conference, which had some interesting highlights. K. R. Ravindran from Sri Lanka proved a moving speaker, as he spoke about the importance of having passion in what we do. He talked of pity killing with kindness, whereas passion gives action and hope to people. He also said, quite rightly, that each Rotary district must look at the sort of things that they can focus on and concentrate on that. This has been made very clear to me, as we have travelled around Karnataka. Indian clubs need to focus on very different things to our clubs in Britain. Finally he talked of a sustainable initiative by Danone, the French milk products company. Apparently they have set up a very successful social, philanthropic business in Bangladesh, which now employs 1,600 people. I need to look further at this.



In the evening there was a choice of karaoke or a presentation of a wide variety of Indian classical dancing. I'll leave our readers to guess who chose which activity, but suffice it to say that we all enjoyed ourselves very much.



It is now time to move on to our final leg of the exchange, which has so far been so eventful.

Witch doctors
Monday 28 – Tuesday 29 January 2013

I’m falling behind with the blog as we are so busy! Other team members have updated our activities from the last few days so I will try to keep this brief.....

We have spent Monday and Tuesday in Karkala where the Rotarians were delighted to meet us all. They had a packed itinerary for us including visiting a church, an artisan centre where we saw some fantastic carving from the students and a museum of old artefacts from the area. My favourite part of the day was the visit to the Rotary hospital where Dr. Asha Hedge works. Although Di has visited a lot of hospitals here, this was my first and it was really interesting to visit a place which specialises in care for women and children. The hospital looked very clean and tidy. I had commented that I had not seen any pregnant women in India, and I got my chance here. Women in India seem to hide their pregnancy well with their sari so it’s hard to tell if somebody is pregnant.

There were many babies in the hospital, sharing a bed with the mother to help them
Team bonding
bond. We also heard a couple of very sad stories of the patients. I was also interested to learn that expectant parents are not allowed to find out the sex of their baby here. This is quite a new system in India and was introduced by the Government to protect female babies, less desired in India as they cost families more through marriage.

Our trip to Karkala also took us to a beautiful waterfall for a picnic, a Jain temple at the top of 200 steps and a traditional festival where communities meet and can have their social problems solved by village witch doctors. It was explained to us that people who have an unfaithful husband or a husband who drinks too much could bring their problems here to have them solved. We did a lot of people watching at the festival and we didn’t see any two ladies with the same sari. The variety and colours of the women’s outfits are amazing!

On our second evening we attended a meeting and a house warming. It was like no house warming you have seen before, with hundreds of people coming along to see the house, share dinner in
House warming
a outside canteen and watch the various blessings take place.

In Karkala, I stayed with two different hosts. Ananthakrishna and his wife Raja had a beautiful home, built by their son in 2005. They were very proud of their house, car and four granddaughters. They had to leave to attend a wedding in Banaglore so I spent my second night bunked up with Nicola. Thank you to Dr.Asha and her husband Prakash for taking me in unexpectedly! And for feeding me up on dosas and fruit!

District conference presentation
As other team members have already mentioned, we had a big audience for our presentation at the District Conference in Mangalore last weekend. Thanks go to Val and Terry Leivers from Nottingham for the picture of us up on stage not looking at all nervous. We have done so many formal and informal (unexpected) presentations now that nothing seems to faze us!

After the long build-up to our conference presentation, it was great to spend an evening winding down, even if it did mean I had to sing in the karaoke bar, which you would never see me doing at home!

We knew we would have the opportunity at the conference to catch up with many of the Rotarians we have spent time with throughout our trip but this time we were saying goodbye for much longer. Having bid so many farewells, it felt quite strange to hop on our bus again and set off to our final two host families. However, we were warmly welcomed in Karkala and immediately started another programme of visits.

Our first visit was to the Rotary hospital, whose main services are for women and children. There is also an ophthalmology department. The
Karkala - bhootha kola festival
hospital teaches students and is associated with a medical college under Manipal University.

We then visited a Catholic church where preparations were being made for the annual Attur Shrine Festival. Thousands of people travel far and wide on a holy pilgrimage. Non-believers and people of other religions also attend.

Also on our programme for the first day in Karkala was a visit to a theme park. We thought this was a bit strange until we were told that it was actually a museum! The Kotti Chennaya Theme Park depicts the lives of two heroes (Koti and Chennaya) through several pictures and there are 10-feet high statues of them. There are also many interesting features of the local culture displayed.

In the afternoon, we saw the skilled work of students at an artisan training centre that is sponsored by Canara Bank. Great talent was evident in their stone and wood carvings, metal work, and terracotta items. Had we not already been struggling with the restrictions on our luggage allowance, I think a few of us may have been tempted to buy a few items!

After a little rest, we were taken to a spiritual festival known as
Karkala - Hanumangundi Falls Kudremukh National Park
bootha kola. We saw the ritual dancers preparing to impersonate a spirit. When viewed in full costume and make-up and seeing them run towards you bearing swords, it is a little unnerving!

The following day, we thought we were going on a trek in the kundremukh national park. It turned out to be a relatively short, gentle, walk to the hanumangundi falls, though there were almost 400 steps involved. It was very peaceful and relaxing sitting in the sunshine at the base of the falls, chatting and eating papaya. We almost had to be dragged away from the scenic beauty of the falls and the national park.

As if one climb that day was not enough, we climbed another 200 steps up to a slightly smaller gommateshwara statue late in the afternoon. At 42 feet high, it is the second tallest in Karnataka (the tallest being the one we saw in Shravanbelagola).

An informal Rotary meeting followed and we delivered a short presentation about ourselves and our experiences so far. We were then whisked off to one of the Rotarian’s relative’s housewarming in Moodabidri. It was a bit like an open house where people were welcomed into the home and were able to wander round at their own pace. I am not sure that I could welcome complete strangers into my home! As is customary here, food is always offered. We therefore sat down to a wonderful selection of foods, eating off a banana leaf.

The hospitality everywhere we go is overwhelming and we are always sad to say goodbye to our hosts but we are looking forward to the next, and last, stop of the tour of Karnataka now, which we believe will be somewhat more relaxed (we’ll soon find out if this is the case!).

We will, we will ....rock you!
Saturday 26 – Sunday 27 January 2013

It’s fair to say that we have been ‘Indianised’. When we first arrived in Mangalore everything was a shock to us. The food, the traffic, the noise and the litter. Now, we are back in the city and everything just feels like home. We don’t notice the noise or the litter anymore, the traffic feels calmer and we can’t wait to eat the Mangalore food and see some of our old friends!

We are back in Mangalore for the district conference. Although we got to relax and meet friends at the venue on Friday night, today was time for serious work as we had to present our experiences to over 3000 people. First though, we were able to listen to the rest of the guests and keynote speakers. Our own presentation went well and we covered what Rotary does in the UK, what we learned on our vocational days as well as our own personal highlights from the trip.

Also at the conference were a couple from Nottingham. They are Rotarians who have spent 10 weeks per year in India for the last six years. They have worked on projects totalling
Banana bun
more than £500,000. It was really interesting to share our thoughts on India with them. And great to hear a British accent again! In the evening, after a long day, it was time for a cultural exchange, so while Angie went to watch some dancing, the rest of us showed the Indians some British Culture..........by singing on the karaoke and dancing to Gangnam Style!

Sunday was a chance to relax and perhaps overindulge. So we started the day with two breakfasts, just so that I had a chance to have my favourite food again, banana buns! After an afternoon of shopping for silks, wall hangings and other gifts, my Mangalore host Rupal picked me up to take me to a famous ice cream parlour called Bappas. The Chocolate Dad ice cream I had was fab! I also got a chance to see Dev and Rahul again and they both beat me at board games before we had a KFC. KFC is not like the KFC in the UK, it’s certainly Indianised!

Prakash, the bakery owner friend of Nicola's has invited Nicola and Emily for dinner and me, Rupal and Punit also go along. Prakash has what I would
Three wise men?
Devdas, Prakash and Punit
call a ‘party room’ in his home with a fantastic bar area which we can enjoy along with Prakash, his wife Keerthi and Devdas and his wife Rekha. We also had some fantastic Indian wine. I might be a convert! The other girls also wanted to try out KFC in India so I made my second trip of the day there. I think it’s time for a serious detox when I get home. The food here has been so amazing that I’m going to find my old diet at home very bland and boring. Luckily I have been given lots of recipes and ideas and I also picked up another cookbook in the mall. So if anybody wants to come round, its hands only, no cutlery!

Goodbye
Friday 25 January 2013

We have said goodbye to our sixth set of hosts today. Jangannadh and Vidya have looked after me very well in Shimoga and Yashas sends us off with a high five. We have a five hour bus journey to Mangalore, along some of the best (or worst?!) roads we have seen. I still can’t believe that people drive on roads like this. There are craters, not potholes, and drivers overtaking on corners. This road has hairpin bends as we go down the side of a huge mountain. It’s all worth it for the views though! We are back in Mangalore for the district conference where we will be presenting to over 3000 people. Good job we have had lots of practice on this trip. And we don’t want to rub it in, but it is 35 degrees here in Mangalore. Enjoy the snow!

I think we have all learned to expect the unexpected on this trip but my vocational visit to a government-run hospital and medical college in Shimoga certainly put me to the test. I thought that catching sight of students working on a cadaver in Mangalore was enough but here I got to see much more than I had ever thought (hoped) I would see in my entire life! I was taken on a tour of the anatomy department of the medical college where there were lots of different body parts on display, including embryos. However, I was then taken into another room where there were brains on slabs waiting to be dissected. I was then told to go through to a small back room and to get close to a tank. Well, there was not just one but three bodies in it! I also saw chopped up body parts in another basin. This tour was not long after breakfast so I’m very pleased I did not have any adverse reactions to what I saw!

Back in the district hospital, I was taken round the paediatric ward and gave the children a small toy to play with. I was informed that families are educated about the importance of nutrition and that meals are tailored to the needs of the children. The mothers of babies that require hospital treatment are able to stay in a separate ward so that they can continue to breast feed. I also visited the intensive care unit where I was surprised to see so many twins.

I then had the opportunity to speak to a member of staff about some of the issues that healthcare services in England face and I was told that there are some similarities. The hospital does not conduct any form of quality of care assessment but does have a very open complaints and suggestions policy. Patients can contact relevant hospital staff directly by telephone 24/7 and any issues are looked into straight away.

This was my last vocational visit of the trip and I have had the opportunity to see things that I would not be able to see back home. I haven’t quite managed to get the full picture of healthcare services so I may have to come back!

Cheeeeese...
Thursday 24 January 2013

Vidya let me into her kitchen today to show me how she makes some of the South Indian cuisine I have been enjoying here, including idly, roti and coconut chutney. I hope I can find the ingredients at home so that I can share them. I also got a chance to play with Yashas and the young neighbour from upstairs. It is quite common here for neighbours and family to walk in and out of each other’s homes. The door always seems to be open, especially in these smaller communities. I was really interested to see that Yashas toy kitchen has all of the traditional Indian utensils. I’m sure the kids at home would be a bit confused by this!

Today is my fifth and final vocational day and I’m visiting KUVEMPU University, along with Angie and four Rotarians. I was delighted when I walked in and spotted a sign for the Public Relations office. I have already visited Manipal University and Mysore University and both said that they didn’t have a PR or communications department so they showed me their journalism faculty instead. KUVEMPU is ranked 92nd out of 4000 universities. However, when I
Kitchen tips
asked about measurement, it seems that the results are all based on what the university says about itself and there is no form of student satisfaction or performance measurement.

First stop is the Vice Chancellors office where we meet Dr. Bari. The chancellor of the university here is the state governor. The university is 25 years old and it caters for a rural and tribal population. To support this, there are 81 affiliated colleges across the state and the university has 55,000 students in total. There are five faculties; Social Sciences, Humanities, Science and Technology, Law and Education. There are 4,000 postgraduate students and 70% of all students are female. This university is more like the university where I work, the University of Cumbria, than any of the others I have visited here. Dr. Bari tells us that the university is highly subsidised by the government and a social sciences student for example would only pay around 3000 rupees per year (about £30 if my calculations are right!).

The students here are well motivated as the country has had a big focus on education for the last ten or 15 years. The economy has opened up and people
KUVEMPU university
are attracted by the employment opportunities available within private companies. Course options fluctuate though as most parents want their children to be engineers or doctors. It means that basic sciences and social sciences are falling out of fashion. The dropout rate is low, just 1%, but of those who do leave, the boys go to seek paid employment opportunities and the girls often have to leave to get married if their parents are offered a good match before they finish their education.

When I ask them what their biggest challenges are, I’m told that the university always struggles with money, despite being funded by the government. They also say that students have much higher expectations when it comes to facilities and lots of welfare measures have recently been introduced for students and staff. They also bring up the topical international visa issue which has been rumbling in UK universities. They want to know what we do about it and if we need more international students in our universities. The staff here, and most of the people we talk to day to day, can’t believe that all of our schools are government funded. Here, only the poor children go to
Meeting the VC
government schools. We also have a very interesting discussion about how Indian people look down upon people in certain professions. Yet, in the UK, we respect skilled people who work hard.

Despite asking again to visit the PR office, we are taken to the management institute where we meet around 100 students. It’s strange to see them in a uniform as I can’t imagine UK students sticking to a uniform rule. We are getting used to giving impromptu presentations and after telling them about my job, the staff and students ask me some questions which cover the things to consider in public relations, the importance of business ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and the qualities of a good manager when it comes to communication and CSR. The management institute encourages entrepreneurship and they work with the local Chamber of Commerce and private businesses to offer placements and experience. The government has its own programme for business start up and sustainability but it doesn’t associate with any university when delivering this.

I ask again to visit the PR office and I am taken to meet a man who has responsibility for PR, however he is a full time
Student talk
academic and there are actually three staff in another office that do the day to day PR activity. The frustrating thing with the vocational days is that we are not always getting to talk to the right people, the ones who could tell me about how the PR office works here and discussions around the differences in the UK. He does tell me that the three staff also do all of the marketing activity and one writes, one types up the writing and the other distributes the information to the media or other stakeholders. They do not have any sort of expert datatbase, they don’t use social media, they have a press meeting with the VC once a month and they publish an internal magazine but it seems to be more about research papers than anything else.

While this may be working for them now, newspapers and media are growing across India and I can imagine that in around 20 years time, the university will have to invest more resources in public relations and communications.

At 6:30am this morning, I went for a short walk with my host in a nearby park. It is quite new and named after Mahatma Ghandi. Apparently, taking a morning walk is a new concept. Local people pay 50 rupees per month to use the park, or 5 rupees per visit, which goes towards the park maintenance.

There were quite a few people out walking and jogging. There was also a group therapy class going on – a laughter club. I was curious about a gentlemen who was sitting on a bench clapping and my host told me that this was another form of therapy.

For children, there is an aquarium, a train ride, and all the usual things you would see in a playground ride back home.

Whilst I was wearing tracksuit bottoms and a T-shirt, the majority were wrapped up as if it was really cold, so I did get a few odd looks (although it could just have been because I was the only white person there!). It was a lovely park to walk in and I wish I had somewhere like this to walk round every day.

On my first night in Shimoga, my host took me to a centre that cares for people who are not able to look after themselves and who have no-one else to care for them. The centre was established in 2007 by a gentleman whose aim in life is to serve others. The majority of the people who are cared for at the centre are people with physical disabilities, though there are also people with mental ill health. 280 people have received care from the centre since it opened.

As soon as I walked into the centre, I saw that there were three occupied beds surrounding the office desk and the television was blaring. The main room off this had at least eight beds but also two people sleeping on the floor. The third room, which was quite small, had three beds. Both males and females slept in each of the rooms. The whole centre lacked any form of ventilation so you can imagine the odour emanating as a result of the heat and the lack of hygiene and cleanliness. I was told that the centre can accommodate up to 30 people at a time, which I found difficult to visualise, as the three rooms were already packed full of beds.

Ten staff provide personal care services. The owner will do anything and everything for the people he welcomes into the centre. No specialist training is provided though the appropriately qualified staff are brought in as required. Doctors voluntarily visit the centre to check on the residents who are all fully dependent on other people. I was told that all they want is to be touched (as if they are a child) and to see other people. People from local social / sports clubs visit the residents but there are no other activities for the residents to engage in.

In a medical emergency, the owner would transport the individual to hospital. I did not see any walking aids or wheelchairs though. Donations are given to the centre and the owner believes any challenges can be overcome. Somehow, the centre finds sufficient funds to provide care to people who may otherwise have nothing. I was pleased to hear that a new site has been found for the centre, which will be next to a new hospital that is being built.

The owner’s dedication to help others is humbling and I hope that local communities continue to support his work.

Dancing elephant
Wednesday 23 January 2013

During the last three weeks, all of us at some point have had to face challenges, cope with difficult situations and become very adaptable to a very different way of life. I think we are all coping remarkably well and we will be sad to leave here in ten days time.

Today started with a ride on an elephant. I also had my first experience of an elephant dribbling down my back and hitting me over the head with its ear at Sakraibail camp. One of the young elephants was showing off and it almost looked like it was dancing for us! This was followed by a Lion and Tiger safari. Although these ones were not completely wild at Bandipur, it was great to see such beautiful animals up close and personal. We also get a chance to visit Shivappanayaka Palace where there are some beautiful wood carvings. I would like to take one of these pieces home for my fireplace!

Back to the more serious stuff, we visited a number of projects supported by the seven Rotary clubs in the Shimoga area. First was some low cost housing in Lakshmipura village on the
Low cost homes
outskirts of the city. The houses were built to support families working in agriculture. I’m pretty sure that the whole village turned out to see us here and they all walk in and out of each other’s homes. This seems to happen a lot in the smaller towns and cities in a way that I don’t think it would in the UK. The houses are small but ideal for the needs of the families and cost just £750 to build.

We also visit a local school supported by Rotary. The kids here also have a Rotaract club which they tell us about. Although they are not quite as confident as the children in the private school we visited earlier this week, Rotaract is helping them to progress. We all present to them and explain our jobs and a bit about life in the UK. Opening the floor for questions was interesting when they asked me about sex education. This isn’t something they will have come across here and I have already had an interesting chat with my host family about a very similar subject.

At the blood and eye clinic we learn about how Rotary are supporting blood
Lion and Tiger safari
collection and distribution in the area. The Government are keen to support blood donation here. Finally, we head to Asha Kirana, a school for children with severe learning disabilities. This school has 48 pupils who board here and it is quite different from the other special schools we have visited in India, much noisier and uncontrolled. We are told that the children are particularly distressed as most were tied up all day when they were living at home. Their parents had to go out to work so the children were left outside, soiled and hungry. The school has taken them in and they live here for 11 months of the year. The parents visit for two weeks and are taught how to care for the children and given targets to meet while they take their child home for the twelfth month of the year. If the child meets those targets, they can return the following year.

We meet a 32 year old woman who was a resident here and now helps the younger children. When the school opened 26 years ago, she was a six year old girl, dumped by her parents who gave a false address and could

not be traced. She was supported by the school and the Rotarians and she has even managed to overcome some of her medical conditions. The school aims to get all of these children back into mainstream education to prevent the stigma placed upon them and their parents.

At home with my hosts, Vidya tells me all about the meals she prepares, the ingredients and preparation. Many of my hosts have been homemakers so they spend a lot of time and effort cooking. And they have staff to help with the cleaning too. Our hosts live by the mantra that ‘the guest is God’ and are keen to feed you lots of food. They can’t understand that we don’t eat so much at home, particularly at breakfast time. Although I was a bit worried that Indian food would be too spicy for me, it has been really nice to try out lots of different things, with and without spice and pepper. South Indian food has so much taste and variety and I will come away with lots of ideas. I have already bought one cook book and been given another as a gift. Just hope I can find a shop
Lunch. Yum!
at home that sells some of the things I need!

All in all, it’s been a very thoughtful day. We are seeing things here that we would probably never get the chance to see in the UK and it makes you realise and appreciate what you have.

Belur host house
Angie and Emily stayed on Chetana Halli Estate
Since Mysore, we have been staying in the beautiful coffee region of Belur. We were all fortunate enough to be hosted by coffee planters on their plantations. Emily and I stayed with a wonderful old man, Ganghia, and his wife, Vashanta. He is evidently highly respected by everyone in the region, deservedly so, it seems to us. His son is the owner of India's largest coffee shop chain, Cafe Coffee Day and apparently one of India's richest people. He is also, we are told, an unassuming man like his father.

The house where we stayed was built about 150 years ago by a coffee planter from Wales. Ganghia's family bought it in the 1940's and have built it up to its 11,000 acres of today. He took us on a tour, showing us the difference between arabica and robusta plants, how they grow in the shade of tall trees such as silver oak and teak, and are interspersed with pepper and cardamom. He then showed us how the beans are washed and dried for seven days in the sun.



We visited some interesting temples, one of which involved climbing 716 steps. There are said to be a

thousand, but I counted far fewer. It was very good to be out in the lovely weather. Our host for the day told us only after he had negotiated all those steps that he had a heart problem! Jain and Hindu temples visited later had the most intricate carvings of animals and gods. In one I was given such a very special holy garland that I could barely carry the weight around my neck.



The giving of garlands and individual flowers, generally roses, is a common custom to honour guests. We have been given so many. Apparently after use it is customary to leave them under a jack fruit tree to wither away.



While in the Belur region we also visited some friendly Rotary clubs, an Interact club and a college named after Ganghia, where village students over 16 are taught English and trained in various subjects in preparation for working for Cafe Coffee Day. They are given six months training with free board, food, uniform and education. They are then required to work for the company for two years, after which they are free to choose whether to stay with the company or

get a different job. The college is in immaculate condition.



We were also shown Ganghia's son's very smart resort hotel, where for a mere £330 a night one can rent an opulent suite, complete with its own pool. The inclusion of a helipad may suggest the wealth of their clientele!



Now we move on to Shimoga for further new experiences.

Diane administering life saving polio vaccines
After a very hectic schedule, I welcomed the opportunity to stay in the middle of a coffee plantation, sit out on the veranda basking in the sun, and wake to the sound of birds singing each morning. Our journeys to, from, and surrounding the areas of Hassan and Belur may have been quite long but it was so good to see some countryside again. The highlight for me had to be the visit to Shravanabelagola where we climbed barefoot up the vindhyagiri hill to a Jain temple. As well as enjoying getting my first bout of exercise on this trip, I took in fantastic views of the city and the gommateshvara statue. We visited two other temples during our time in the Hassan district – the Hindu Hoysaleswara temple at Halebeedu and the Chennakeshava temple complex at Belur. Both of these are amazing architectural feats. A special puja ritual was performed for us and Angie was adorned with a rather grand flower garland – a great honour.

The next excitement was visiting three polio immunisation booths. I had the opportunity to give polio drops to two children – it was not as easy as you think! It was good to see a group of children attending one of the booths and the commitment and hard work of the Rotarians and healthcare workers manning these booths was greatly appreciated by the families.

We also saw rotary in action when we visited a school’s Interact club. The young ladies all spoke with great enthusiasm and confidence about the activities they are able to engage in through rotary. It was really good to hear young people talk this way; they clearly valued the experience and I’m sure they all have bright futures ahead of them.

Back at my host’s house, I started reading the best book about yoga I have ever come across and was inspired by his views on yoga and meditation. All in all, even with all the extra visits that were slotted into our visit to the Hassan district, I felt it was a place where I could spend some quiet time reflecting on what we have experienced so far on our journey. Reading the yoga book will make my journey home slightly more bearable but I don’t want to think about that just yet, as there is so much more to see and do here!

January 22nd 2013

For my vocational day in Mysore, three very different visits had been arranged for me. The first of these was to a 90-bed private hospital that is part of an international chain of hospitals providing world-class healthcare. It opened in 2009 and recently achieved accreditation with international standards. A community ethos is an integral value for the hospital; free / concessional clinics are offered every month. Although I have not visited a private hospital in England, the facilities, services, and operational procedures I observed and was informed about were in line with what I would expect and hope to see in any hospital.

I was slightly surprised that the hospital had only one ambulance (with access to a back-up). The emergency department was only set up with three beds, though it could accommodate six and could also use the entrance hall / waiting area in the event of a disaster (room for an additional 6 beds). If the hospital is unable to provide treatment immediately, it sends patients to its sister hospitals nearby, providing any necessary first aid before transfer.

As a private, corporate, hospital, it does not experience the same issues as government-run hospitals. For example, it is able to offer higher salaries and attract the best surgeons. It also has an effective workforce planning system to ensure that patient care does not suffer. The most impressive aspect for me was the company’s commitment to supporting its staff; time is set aside every day for staff training.

My second visit of the day was to a District Health Office where I was told that key priorities relating to maternal and child health were all improving, such as institutional deliveries, and infant and maternal mortality rates. Programmes that focus on population stabilisation also continue to be implemented. There are, however, constant challenges, such as the infrastructure and shortage of manpower for medical and specialist services.

The final visit was to an Ayurvedic Centre. I was pleased to hear that they take an integrated approach to healthcare, ensuring that guests are referred as necessary for the most appropriate form of healthcare. Everybody receives an individual assessment and their treatments and food are customised accordingly. The centre has recently started an Ayurveda cooking class for its staff and may open this up to the public in the future. Training packages are available for people who wish to achieve certification in specific Ayurveda treatments so I may well find myself back in Mysore!

Angie and her garland
Monday 21 - Tuesday 22 January 2013

Can’t believe that we have been in India for almost three weeks now! Time is flying and we have been so lucky to see and do all of these amazing things.

Our last day in Belur is spent at two rotary meetings and visits to two temples and a school. It is great to go along to the informal rotary meetings as you get a chance to learn about the people, the club and the projects they support. Many of them are school or healthcare projects as their government does not fund these in the way that our Government does. Belur temple is very beautiful and inside, they perform a special type of worship for us, presenting Angie with a massive garland of flowers. Onwards to Mudigere where we attend the second meeting and visit a Rotaract club at the school across the road. The kids in the club are great at public speaking and they are very dedicated to the club. There is no doubt that it has also helped to build their confidence. The younger kids at the school are delighted to see us and Emily and Nicola are mobbed!
Research and development
Taste testers


Angie and Emily are staying with a family who own a coffee estate and have built up an empire of coffee shops called Cafe Coffee Day. Everywhere you look here, you see a Cafe Coffee Day, it is as big as Costa or Starbucks in the UK. Emily and Angie will be able to explain more about it but their host wants to show us some of the projects they fund. These include a school and a vocational training centre where they teach poorer people English and hospitality skills before giving them a job in their chain. The kids here seem genuinely grateful for the opportunity to better themselves. We also visit a meditation centre funded by the family and also the Cafe Coffee Day research centre. They won’t want us to write too much about their research but it all looks great and I’m pretty sure that in the very near future, we could see Cafe Coffee Day on the British high street. I’m going to look them up when I get home and read more about their CSR across wider India.

Tonight is a party, hosted by my family Rajendra and Janhavi. I can’t wait to
Party at our house
We don't want to leave our host family
have everybody round for drinks and food. I want to show the other girls the fantastic home which me and Nicola have been welcomed into. All of the host families and other members of the Rotary club join us for some refreshments and an amazing spread of food. I’m really sad to say goodbye to Rajendar and Janhavi in the morning. We have had a fantastic time and been treated so well, considering they got landed with two of us instead of one. Janhavi has given us some beautiful gifts, including some coffee which was made on their very own estate. With sad faces, we leave Belur for Shimogga. But we can never stay sad for too long as moving onto our next place is always exciting. This will be our sixth set of hosts and we are welcomed with garlands, flowers and tender coconut.

I am staying with Jagganadh and Vidya and their 21 month old grandson Yashas. Jagganadh owns a petrol station with his brothers and Vidya is a homemaker and full time grandmother. Their daughter and son in law are doctors living in the UK and they come home to visit Yashas when they can. He
Yashas....too cute
He likes English nursery rhymes!
speaks to them on the phone all the time and I even have a chat with his mum when she calls from Nottingham. They take me out to a local Country Club where Yashas likes to play in the park and we also visit their local temple. I have quite a deep and meaningful conversation with Vidya when she asks me about religion and life in the UK. She comes up with quite a few things that make me have a little think about my life and my beliefs. This is a genuinely lovely family and I’m sure that I can learn a thing or two from them while I’m here in Shimogga.

Beautiful Belur home
Rajendra and Janhavi
Saturday 19 – Sunday 20 January 2013

We said a fond farewell to our Mysore hosts and headed off to Hassan today, ready for our fourth vocational day. I visited a local newspaper printed in the local language of Kannada. I think what has surprised me most is that the paper costs 150 rupees for just four pages. To put that into context, we bought supplies of biscuits, sweets and juice at a supermarket and it only cost 80 rupees (about £1). Yet the paper is increasing in popularity as more and more people want to keep up to date with local politics. Unexpectedly, the editor took the opportunity to throw a camera and microphone in my face and then tell me that he also runs a local TV channel. It’s hard to be part of an interview without any questions though. I asked him what he wanted to know and he wasn’t exactly sure himself! I managed to cobble something together. Those who know me will know that this it wasn’t too much of a problem for me to keep talking!

After the vocational days we headed to our next home........wow! That’s all I can say! Due to
800 steps.....
some unforeseen circumstances, Nicola is also staying with my host for the next three days and we both feel like we have walked into heaven. Rajendra and Janhavi own a 200 acre coffee estate. The house is a new build but reflects the style of most coffee estates in this area and has British influence. So, as well as having an amazing fireplace, we also have our own bar! The house is packed full of beautiful pieces of antique furniture and books about foreign destinations they have visited. We have our own twin rooms and bathrooms bigger than our own homes. Oh, and a cook. I don’t think we will want to leave Belur!

It’s an early start on Sunday morning. 5am to be precise! But I wake up to find out that I’m front page news here. And I was on the local TV news last night. I’m not sure that it was factually correct but I can’t read the local language anyway so I will let that one slip I think!

We need to get up early to enjoy the views at the top of Shravanbelagola, a Jain temple, and there are 800 steps to walk
Shravanbelagola
up on the way. It is certainly worth it as we get to the top and see the shrine and watch worship rituals taking place. It’s fair to say that we would never get an opportunity like this anywhere else and it is amazing to watch people who are so involved in their beliefs. I think that the one disappointment for me is the young girls with babies and children who are begging us for money. We haven’t seen much of it here as we are staying with relatively wealthy families and not visiting too many tourist areas. However, when we do see it, it makes me very emotional and it’s hard not to offer them the money in your purse. Some of them are so young and even the children are calling for you to give them food. Time to put the sunglasses on and pretend I’m not crying at the sight of them.

On the bus, we also get to see more of rural India. This area seems to have a bigger Muslim population as we see men in traditional dress on the streets. There also seems to me to be fewer women around here. Transport here
Polio immunisation
is amazing and you see a bus packed with people, often jumping on and off while moving, cyclists grabbing a lift by holding the back of a truck, bull carts packed with huge amounts of straw, families of five on one two-wheeler and trucks packed to bursting with people hitching a lift.

We stop off at three Rotary Polio Immunisation stations around the town. Today is a national immunisation day and children under five are brought to the stations to have drops placed on their tongue and purple ink put on their left pinkie finger to show they were immunised. Thanks to Rotary, Polio has almost been completely wiped out in India. We are told that although the stations are not so busy, they have to have lots of them dotted around the city to encourage people to come. If they see a queue they will simply drive past without stopping.

After presenting for the fifth time, this one for the Hassan and Belur clubs, we head to Halebeedu and see an ancient temple with intricate carvings. Unfortunately some of this has been ruined by invaders hundreds of years ago. This evening we have been able to spend
Halebeedu temple
some time with our hosts Rajendra and Janhavi. They have shown us around their estate, including the coffee pulping and drying areas, the crops and then the viewpoint on a hill behind the house, looking over the Western Ghats. Stunning. Rajendra and Janhavi have many family members who own adjoining estates and much of the land we can see is theirs or their relatives. Rajendra explains that the drought is affecting his business and he can’t tell from year to year how it will be. This is one job where nature really does make a difference. The pepper which they also grow here helps to keep the business going.

Mysore Palace
Illuminated weekly on Sundays from 7pm - 8pm
Just as we are thinking that Indian driving is chaotic, we come to Mysore and discover traffic lights, traffic police and CCTV cameras checking on road use. So you see traffic waiting at junctions to allow others to cross, a sight not seen in Mangalore. I must apologise to our Indian hosts if I seemed critical of their roads.

Mysore is a beautiful city, with many interesting old buildings as well as some very attractive houses, which appear to come from the Art Deco movement. There is also some innovative modern architecture. The station is housed in an attractive Victorian building, but the star is Mysore Palace.

The present palace was built in 1912 to replace the previous one, which was built in 1800 and burnt down. The current palace is full of beautiful carved doors and ceilings and interesting murals of events in the lives of the royal family. Elephants abound and gold adorns palanquins. We were lucky enough to see the palace lit up on Sunday evening where from 7pm - 8pm each week 1000's of people gather to watch the switch on. It was quite amazing and certainly gave Blackpool illuminations a run for their money!!!
Prince of Mysore's personal collection of taxidermy
Most of these animals were killed in the 40's & 50's. Impressive sight up close as so realistic!
Later in the week we also took part in a special guided tour of the palace which allowed us access to secret rooms not open to the public. Parts of the architecture reminded us of Buckingham Palace and similar to our Queen's residence and similarly the current Prince lives behind the main building (away from tourists!!!).

The team are coping remarkably well with the exchange. They are a lively group of people, very keen to learn. They show a real interest in everything there is to learn here in Karnataka and are genuinely grateful for all that is being done for us. There is plenty of humour too; they really enjoy laughing together. All in all it is a very well chosen group of people, so congratulations are in order for the D 1190 GSE interviewing panel. David Simpson would be pleased to see what fun they enjoy.

Infosys Campus
A very impressive business model
Thursday 17 – Friday 18 January 2013

Thursday starts with a trip to Infosys campus. Infosys is a huge success story for India and the men behind the software company have created a global success story over the past 30 years. Infosys is a NASDAQ 100 company with offices across the globe. They employ more than 50,000 people and this Global Education Centre in Mysore is like a holiday village for the thousands of trainees who stay here every year. The company believes that staff will work better and train harder when they are well looked after so the site has its own accommodation, food court, bowling alley, gym facilities, cinema, swimming pool and even shops, housed across 110 buildings. It is similar to a Centre Parcs holiday camp in the UK, except top software experts are learning their trade here. It seems quiet on our visit and we are told this is the effect of the recession in the west. Despite this, the company still appears to be leading the way in training and client satisfaction.

At Mysore Palace, we get VIP treatment and are allowed to visit some areas which are closed to the public, including a
Roar...
room displaying all of the weapons used throughout the history of the palace and then a taxidermy room. The animals displayed here are amazing. The palace itself is beautiful and well maintained. The prince still lives in part of it.

For the meeting tonight, Anu, Nimisha and her friend all want to dress me up in a traditional outfit. I don’t mind at all as they spend more than an hour wrapping me in some beautiful silk, adding gold jewellery and a bindi for the finishing touches. Nimisha has also put mehendi on one of my hands. It looks fantastic and feels very elegant.

Early start for a Friday as I’m joining Nimisha and her friend on their daily walk around the local lake to watch the sun rise. It really is beautiful, though the girls are feeling the cold. We joke that they should try getting up on a January morning at home, then they will know what cold is!

Today we visit Jaganmohan Palace to take in the artwork on display. There are some beautiful pieces here, including furniture and trinkets, and many have links to the British history of India. We head onwards to
Mehendi
Bandipur Tiger Reserve, which turns out to be quite an experience for some of the group! As well as seeing hundreds of wild boar and monkeys playing and carrying their young, we see some tamed elephants working in the national park. The park covers hundreds of square miles of forest land and the team here are working to protect the area and increase the number of wild animals living here. Before we take our safari trip, we are given a lodge to relax in. After a tour of the information centre, we make use of the lodge. However, one of the monkeys got a bit too close to Angie for comfort and started hissing, before trapping Nicola on the balcony as it tries to make its way into the lodge. Luckily, a security guard came to the rescue! Honestly ladies, I leave you all alone for ten minutes and you can’t cope!!

On the safari, we are lucky enough to see a huge variety of wild animals, including a herd of elephants. It obviously wasn’t our day as one of the elephants also attempted to warn us off while protecting its young. Little bit scary to be honest!
Traditional dress
Me with Anu

Tonight we get a little bit of time with our hosts and I have a discussion with Anuradha about their local newspaper and the stories and adverts it prints. Todays headine is about a tiger attacking a local photographer! Some of the job adverts are very discriminative but Anu explains that it also works the other way too. She has campaigned for years to provide better employment opportunities for differently able people and it is paying off now and they are seeing results. It is hard to believe that it’s already our last night in Mysore! The Nandakumar family have been lovely hosts and it has been great spending time with them here in their home. The food has been particularly nice!

Mysore Silk Factory Shop
Company is owned by Government and only use silk produced in India.
For all those ladies reading this that like to wear silk scarves you might want to brace yourself for the inside story on how this amazing fabric is produced. In the UK we associate the Mulberry with very old bushes as depicted in the traditional nursery rhyme.

Today we were lucky enough to get a guided tour of the Mysore Silk Factory, which is famous for it’s intricate gold and silver woven patterns. It is actually protected with a Geographical Indicator which recognises the unuque product produced in the city and means nobody else can copy the designs.

The factory receives the silk yarn from the farms (more about that later!) and first needs to soak the yarns to remove the saliva from the silk worm who has woven the cocoon. This process is known as “degumming” and can take 3hours of soaking in water heated to 110 degrees centigrade. The chemicals dyes are added after this stage and take 2.5 hours to colour enough yarn for approx. 24 saris.The yarn is first woven by hand and then onto reels with a machine before heading to the loom for weaving.

Genuine gold and silver is woven into the
Saris come in beautiful range of colours
threads used for the patterns and contain 65%!p(MISSING)recious metals and saris containing these threads can sell for between 11,000 (£125) to 120,000 (£1350) rupees and the material is extremely high quality.

The beautiful thing about silk is that is waterproof, breathable, wrinkle free and even perfumed. The perfect garment for all round wearing! The material is even treated with Scotch Guard to resist stains.

Factory facts:

- 250-300 saris produced each day
- Approx. 420,000m per annum
- It takes between 5.5 and 6.3m to make one sari
- Factory produces around 80,000 saris per year

The factory is very safety and environmentally aware – they have a large number of ISO, EMS & Health & Safety standards and also try to conserve energy and water wherever possible. They have managed to save 15%!((MISSING)approx 2-4 tonnes per month) on coal consumption, but installing solar panel hot water heaters. There is fully traceability in the factory with each piece of material being printed with unique ID number which notifies which colour dye was used, which loomed it was woven on and date of production. A specific “100%!P(MISSING)ure Mysore Silk” transfer is also ironed onto
Harish showing us the silk worm harvest
each piece.

The following day Angie and I went to a silk worm farm about 40km east of Mysore accompanied by Harish who is an Agricultural Office with Karnataka State Government. It was very interesting to learn about how the silk worms are cultivated for their valuable threads.

Firstly the silk worm eggs are hatched and then worms are fed on finely chopped mulberry leaves until fully grown. They are reared indoors on large racks and fresh leaves are given every 4-5 hours to encourage growth. When the worms start to turn yellow they are taken outside to special circular woven nest (see photo) where they will start to weave their cocoons after 3-4 days. Unfortunately the beautiful butterflies never get to hatch and the worms are killed before the cocoons are dried, boiled and reeled in the factory. Cocoon yarn is then woven into the fabric of many saris in India and many other clothes across the world.

Silk worm facts

- 7.5kg of cocoons converts to 1kg of silk
- 90m of yarn comes from each cocoon
- Factory has capacity to process 20,000kg (20 tonnes) of cocoons each month

Bet you
Close up of silk worms
These worms have been fed on freshly chopped Mulberry leaves for 10 days and nearly ready to start the cocoon stage once they turn yellow colour.
won’t look at a Mulberry bush in quite the same light anymore!!! Hope you've enjoyed reading my latest blog and will be be back again soon!!!

While we are all enjoying meeting new people, especially with everyone being so warm and welcoming, we are trying very hard to remember names and to pronounce them correctly, not always successfully! We have noticed that this seems to be the case for our names too, over the last week we've come across a variety of new names so I thought share a few with you. Angie has been re-named Angela Briggs, and Di has been changed to Dina and Deyan. Emily is actually a word meaning Tamarind so she is naturally called that and has also had an Amelia. While I have taken to being called Nicole and had my last name changed to Oswald! Tracy seems to be the most awkward, she has gone from Tracky to Tacky to Tacy to Chesy but her favourite is Aunty!! What is simple to us seems to be surprisingly hard for other cultures, it's just nice to know it's not just us!!

Mangalore 1000 pillar temple
Fully hand carved from granite!
Upon arrival in Mangalore we are taken on a city tour and learn about the temple which Mangalore derives it’s name from – Mangaluru Temple and we learn a lot about the Hindu Gods. There are so many to pray to for different traits that it gets a little confusing at times, but the temples are very tranquil places and we spend some time sitting and reflecting on life before leaving each one (usually through the door backwards so you don’t turn your back on the Gods). We are also taken to the impressive 1000 pillar temple which is contructed completely of granite.

Devdas (our GSE Coordinator here in Karnataka) and his wife Reika host us for lunch (along with Devdas’s Mum and Dad) in their apartment and put on a wonderful spread of food. They are strict vegetarians and have taken great care over preparing food without milk products for Nicola.

I am staying with Anil Gonsalves and his wife Bina and their 13 year old daughter Kavya. The family have 2 dogs: 1 is a Dachshund called Toby and the other is an 11 year old retriever called Elise who is nearly blind. Yet another interesting host
Devdas Kamath and family
Devdas is our GSE coordinator here in India and done a fabulous job of arranging our programme!
experience as this time I am living with a Catholic family and spend a long time looking through Kavya’s First Communion photos, which were really interesting. Anil works in pharmaceutical distribution and his is conveniently located underneath the house. They are from Portugese orgin and have travelled the world a lot on family holidays, including a trip to Bethlehem at Christmas to visit the Church of Nativity, as well as Italy, USA and UK.

My vocational visits took place on Tuesday 8th January and I was well looked after by Herman Cornelius Joseph Farrar – amazing name!!! First of all we went to meet Dr Geeta who is an expert in coffee cultivation and studied her Masters in the USA at Pennsylvania. We had a long chat for nearly 2 hours about the markets for coffee here in India and how producers could come together and market direct to customers. It seems to me that we don’t see enough Indian coffee on our shop shelves and yet there are many benefits the coffee grown here could be sold for i.e. the environmental benefits of the multiple crop cultivation over that of the African and South America coffees which tend
7to7 coffee branding
Women owned coffee growing cooperative
to be grown in a monoculture. I learnt about a group of women coffee growers who have started selling their own product under the brand “7to7” and would like to find out more about this project once I am back in the UK.

I gave Dr Geeta a copy of Northern Farmer as I thought she might be interested to read about the agricultural sector in England and she was very kind and gave me a lovely silk scarf. I also tasted my first cup of coffee in about 2 years and it was rather delicious!!! It was made with Arabica beans from her own family coffee estate and had a little milk and some sugar in it – don’t think I could drink it every day, but I was glad I tried it!

Next we head to Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) where Nicola also joins us for the tour. This is a privately funded, cooperative milk processing company and are shown the fully factory from milk tanker arrival to final product. I was really interested to learn about the different products which have much higher milk fat content than in the UK. KMF produces 4 main milk
Death by butter!!!
Nicola couldn't resist a little nibble, despite her lactose intolerance!
products ranging from 3% fat to 6.1%. The plant has the capacity to process 480,000 litres per day and can pasteurise 30,000 litres of milk every hour. At present there is a milk shortage in Mangalore (as it’s a coastal region and more crops are grown than cattle farms) so the milk has to come from slightly further away and at the moment not producing to full capacity. After the tour we got the chance to meet the Managing Director and I didn’t stop firing questions at him!

Farmers are paid approximately 22.7 rupees per litre of milk received at the plant (based on 3.1% milk fat and 8.5% solid fats) and this equates to roughly 3p per litre! 634 farms supply KMF and the Government adds a 2 rupee subsidy to each litre processed and the company only keeps 4 rupees per litre of milk for overheads and business development to fund the cooperative in the future. I think this is a good system and what makes it even more intriguing compared to the UK is that the other subsidies available to farmers are funded by the cooperative itself – cattle feeding troughs, building loans and machinery purchase.
Kalbavi cashew factory
A lot of work goes into producing cashew nuts and I will never complain about the price again!!!
This is all funded via the cooperative mechanism and farmers need to supply KMF with milk for at least 180 days in the year to remain members.

Maria and his wife kindly took me for lunch at a lovely Chinese restaurant called Hao Ching and we shared chicken chow mein and BBQ pork. It was yummy...........

Afterwards they took me to the final visit at the Karnataka State Horticultural Board where I got to ask lots of questions about the subsidies provided to farmers. The “programmes” usually last for 12 months, whereas in the UK we normally have 3 – 5 year schemes. The intervention rate is usually 80% (35% from state and 45% from national government) which is a lot higher than our farming grants in the UK, which are usually around 40 – 60%. Mechanisation and irrigation seem to be the most popular types of grants as a lot of the fruit crops require a lot of labour to harvest and a continuous supply of water. The monsoon season here in South India lasts for 2-3 months during June – Sept and then no rain at all for the rest of the year. Capturing rainwater and re-using waste water are big priority for all businesses, not just agricultural based ones. We have seen a lot of solar panels on properties and energy saving posters on the roadside.

I also found it interesting to learn that the Indian Government farming subsidies provide 50%!o(MISSING)f funding in first instalment and then 50%!a(MISSING)fter completion of project or purchase of machinery , whereas in the UK farmers often have to pay out the full costs and only get reimbursed afterwards. Karnataka. There is also a push here in India to increase the size of organic land as well as encourage biogas plants and bio-digester systems.

So much more has happened in Mangalore that I can’t fit it all into one blog and some of the activities have been mentioned in other blogs, but in summary I’ve also experienced:
- riding a jet-ski on Mangalore beach
- Moodibidri Rotary meeting and then tour of University of Bangalore research farm
- Ice cream at Babba’s
- drank cardamom tea
- tried eating “ice apple” fruit for the first time
- riding passenger on a scooter
- eaten a lot of cashew nuts!!!
- successfully delivered our 3rd presentation (after we had to borrow a travel adapter for my laptop from the hotel!!!)
- drank whiskey and apple juice for the first time

A lot of the things we have seen or talked about in Mangalore have really made me think more about where the products we buy in the UK are from. I will never moan about the price of cashew nuts again after seeing how hard everyone in the factory works!

Will catch up on other blogs ASAP! Take care, Emily X

Gardens
Tuesday 15 – Wednesday 16 January 2013

Lack of wifi here means we can’t keep you all up to date as much as we would like. Some of us have it in some homes and others don’t so we are trying our best to use open networks in malls and shops when we get a moment. Thank you to everybody who has left comments and messages on the blog so far, we all really appreciate them.

Our first full day in Mysore kicks off with a visit to the silk factory which produces the world famous Mysore Silk. Unfortunately (like all the best places) we can’t take photos inside. The process of creating beautiful saris from the spit of silk worms is fascinating; especially the gold threads which make them appear extra special. At the end of the tour we get to take a look around the silk shop to admire the saris, scarves and shirts. We are all a bit like kids in a sweet shop looking through the beautiful colours and designs. Even the poorest people here are dressed beautifully and when we ask about second hand shops, they tell us that people simply pass on old
Crocodile!
saris to maids. However, the saris are so well made and durable that many of them last for years and years.

After meeting our new hosts and visiting their homes, we head to Srirangapatna, the land of Tipu Sultan, and we learn all about the history of his palace, the battles fought and the battles won on this land. My host Anuradha joins us for this trip. Anu is married to Nandakumar and they have two children who live at home. Nimisha is 20 and studies civil engineering at a local university and Nishanth is 27 and works in software production. Anu works for an organisation that aims to develop employment opportunities for adults with learning disabilities. Nandakumar is an engineer and has his own construction company. They are both heavily involved with Rotary, Inner Wheel and the local branch of the national union for builders.

Last stop for the day is Ranganathittu, a bird sanctuary, where we take a boat around the lake and see quite a lot of crocodiles basking in the sun. A quiet night with the family gives me a chance to learn more about them all and we watch the DVD of Mysore
The newsroom
festival so that I can learn more about the city too.

Day two in the city is my vocational day. A lovely Rotarian called Keshav takes me along to the Star of Mysore newspaper, the University of Mysore, and then a church and reservoir with a beautiful temple and hotel for lunch just for good measure!

The Star of Mysore newspaper is one of the best read in south India and a morning copy is printed in Kannada, the local language. The evening copy is in English. News Editor Meera shows us around and explains that there are three reporters and one photographer on demand ready to react to stories across the city. Today there has been a fire at a factory. Most of the news here comes from locals phoning the office. Very few press releases received ever make it to print. The reporters here don’t have any real qualifications. They just need to have good English and a flare for writing. They don’t use social media here, although they do have a website and some news can be found online. The most common news here is crime, major incidents such as the fire, news about religion
St. Philomena's
or community leaders and they have also recently started a column of feng shui. Other contributors do music reviews, columns and features. Local newspaper reach may be declining across the western world as more people go online to hand pick their news, but in India and China, circulation is increasing. As more and more of the population become literate, and as the country is constantly changing and developing, people want to be a part of it and reading a newspaper is an ideal way to learn more.

Next stop is the University of Mysore. They have a big Communication and Journalism Department which has links to Kingston University in London. Media in India is still male dominated but things are changing and the male to female ratio in the faculty is 4:3. The students here are Masters students, 60% of them without any background in journalism. Hundreds of students are applying for the course each year as media becomes a more popular subject. They must study both practical and theoretical classes each day and they produce a newspaper every 15 days, one in English, one in Kannada. Sapna shows us around the faculty. She is a former GSE member
1000 year old temple restoration
from 2008 when she travelled to Brazil.

As we have some free time, Keshav shows me St. Philomena’s Church. From the outside you could be mistaken for thinking you are in Europe. A wedding is taking place inside and the bride is wearing a traditional Indian sari in green and white, topped off with a veil. The church does not look like a traditional church from inside and the vibrant colours make it look and feel quite different. Keshav also takes me to the reservoir. It was created in the 1930’s to store water for agricultural purposes and a town was flooded to create it. However, around eight years ago, the water levels dropped and the 1000 year old temple was visible. A businessman, specialising in liquor, asked the Government to gift the temple to him and he would restore it and relocate it, brick for brick, on higher ground. Maybe his way for making up for his sins around encouraging alcohol consumption?! The reconstruction is still taking place and it looks like a painstaking job! However, as this temple is not yet in use, it’s almost deserted so we get a real chance to look around and enjoy
Chamundi Hills temple monkeys
it. People here are genuinely worried about the lack of water and what it will mean for them. The next state, Tamil Nadu, has an ongoing dispute with Karnataka about water as one particular river runs through both states. Neither has enough supplies and they hope that the water levels will rise in the monsoon season. There are daily updates in the paper about the feud and what might happen.

Next stop is Silent Shores Resort where we have lunch. This is by far the nicest resort I have seen in India and it’s not hard to see why this place attracts international tourists. It looks just like a Caribbean resort except the swimming pool and bar are deserted! And apparently it’s only around £60 per night to stay here. Bargain I think! The team spend the evening in the Chamundi Hills above Mysore. The view is beautiful. There is a mad dash to make it into the temple along with all of the locals so that we can see the idol they are worshiping. This idol fought on the hill and she should bring us good luck. There are monkeys all over the top of the temple and more cows than ever strolling around the streets. After the hills, we go along to watch some traditional singing which is part of a presentation organised by my hosts. The singing is quite unusual and somebody has explained that it is about giving women in India equality.

At home, Nimisha, a movie addict, shows me my very first Bollywood film, Three Idiots. It’s actually quite easy to follow as the languages here seem to have merged together and every third or fourth word is English. The subtitles help too! Nimisha has promised to paint some Mehendi on my hands tomorrow and let me wear one of her Saris too so I’m looking forward to that!

Paradise
13th jan 2013

It's such an amazing feeling.
To be excited. To be really looking forward to the year ahead, to your life ahead.
This is probably the only time I've been away and felt happy that I was going home, I mean I have 2 more weeks the time in the ashram, something I've been looking forward to since I last visited in 2010 but after that I will be back in London. Back to start my new full time contacted job, to start looking for my own place, to find a good salsa and yoga class, to appreciate the insane opportunities London has to offer.
Since I last wrote I've been distressing! I woke up on New Year's Eve to a lovely morning birthday breakfast from Tamzin Demant! 😊
I then surreally went to the boys home, and taught an English class on days of the week, I then went to a party on the family who runs peace child farm which is on the out skirts of Bangalore. All I can say really about that night is, I got chatted up by a 20year old, asked why there were so many white people and then pasted out on a roof.

On the 1st, hungover and bemused Tamzin and I took an a/c over night bus to Gokarna town.

We made our way to Om beach, where we spent 5days bathing in the sun, relaxing and playing cards.

No matter how many times I come to an Indian beach I douth i'll get use to cows on the beach, as I sunbathed one day, a mother cow stopped above my towel and started mooing, until a baby cow came over and began to milk, a strange, strange sight.

We then headed on an overnight train to Fort Cochin, its one of my favourite towns in the south, with nice coffee shops,art galleries and the luxury of brown bread 😊

while wandering around with two boys i'd meet in our hostel we ran into a advert shot, we were immediately accosted and asked to be part of a scene where westerners dance behind and cheer on Indian street dancers, the adverts for Clickon home entertainment, watch out Bolloywood!

A public ferry and a boiling walk brought Tamzin and I to the ladies carriage of a commuter train to Alleppy, paying for general means benches, crowds and a lot of men, not however if you get there early enough to get some room in the ladies carriage. Sat on the luggage rack above 6people on a beach for 3 Tamzin and I listened to our ipods and some became the subject of everyones conversation, we decided to liven things up a little and Tamzin broke out on her guitar, the carriage was alive with smiles, song and as much dancing as is possible on a over crowed train, it was possibly my best journey in Indian, made even better by our destination being my Keralan home, Mandala Beach Huts, Alleppy.

My favourite Sari
14 January 2013

Even though this is our one day off during the trip, and a national holiday, I still manage to wake up at 8am! It’s lovely to enjoy some sunshine beside the pool, read a book and listen to some music. We are staying at the Mysore Sports Club for two nights and we even manage to get to the local mall to do some shopping and use the wifi to update the blog. I think one of the hardest parts about being away is the lack of internet access. Most of us use it every day to access emails, instant messaging and news and information from home. I wouldn’t say that we are home sick by any means but it’s good to send and receive some messages from home now and again. I have seen some beautiful Sari’s, some very traditional and some very modern which appeal to me. The women who wear them here take great care of them and look immaculate when they wear one. In the bigger and more modern cities it is more common to see women in jeans or leggings and tunic tops, though they would wear a Sari for special occasions.
Even Angie wanted a Dominos
I have also bought some books about the history of India, the revolution in India and some cookery books. We take the opportunity to enjoy a Domino’s before we head back to the hotel. On the way we see a yellow cow lying close to a busy road, as you do! Apparently these cows are turned yellow during some local festival celebrations. We are all taking a well deserved break tonight to try to consolidate some of the items we have picked up on our way. There are even discussions about buying extra suitcases to bring it all home! We are not even half way through the trip yet. We are all looking forward to the next part of the adventure, the people we will meet and the sights we will see along the way. Just need to catch up on our sleep first.

India: to summarise so far, 14.01.13
To say that we have been welcomed is an understatement. In India a guest is like a god. Our hosts can not do enough for us. We have been piled up with presents much too heavy or bulky to carry home. One day last week I was taken to a large private school and asked to address the 1,200 students. That was relatively easy, since I could tell them about the Lake District and explain why we were in India. I was then asked to present prizes to the cutest tiny kids, all about five years old. To my surprise, I was told later that most of the students had gone home and told their parents all about me, even remembering my name. Imagine that in a British school! Later in the day I was taken to a meeting, where everyone had heard about me and milled around as if I was some sort of celebrity. This was particularly true of the youngsters. I felt like a pop star. I was followed all evening by a local journalist, who kept thinking of new questions to ask me. His English was really difficult to understand and my answers had to be translated to him. I haven't seen his article yet. It will be interesting to see how closely it reflects what I said. Our hosts have been at pains not to make their food too spicy, but I think they have offered us every type of southern Indian cuisine. They have been fascinated by Nicola, our chef, and she by them. Emily, as an agriculturalist, has also had a very interesting time, gathering all manner of information about a wide range of crops. As for what local Rotarians do for poor people in India, we have heard a lot. We visited a very well appointed school for the mentally challenged, who are hoping that clubs in District 1190 will partner the Mangalore North club in applying for a matching grant to help them to buy a bus to ferry students across Mangalore to get to school. If you could see the traffic and the public bus services, you would recognise how important this is. We in Britain wouldn't dream of letting such vulnerable children travel by public transport and their families are far too poor to pay for private transport. We have also heard about work in the field of health and helping youngsters with solar lamps for when there are power cuts, which prevent them from doing their homework. There is another difference, British children would just use that as an excuse for not working, but education is a high priority for young people here. Other clubs have shown us a home for special needs adults, funded by them, a cancer help initiative and a play school, where I was asked to hand out sweets. One tiny tot was so overwhelmed that he burst into tears. There are so many other initiatives, too numerous to mention. Suffice it to say that we have been impressed by their enthusiasm to help those less fortunate than themselves. To return to traffic, by British standards it is dreadful. It is hard to describe how unconscious they are of anything like traffic lanes. It is just an inexplicable mess. I'll try to take a video of it from the bus window some time. Almost no one wears a seat belt or a crash helmet. I think that's enough for now. Considering this is the IT capital of India, it is most surprising how few homes have Wifi, but I'll email this to you as soon as I can find it. To Tim Keegan and all at Kendal Rotary Club, Len Baseley, David Simpson, Vas (or Vasu, as they would say here), John Alderson and all at the Rotary Club of Upper Eden, Margaret Morrison and all at Kendal Inner Wheel Club Love from Ange

After spending a whole week in Mangalore, and a couple of days in Kushulnagar, it is about time I let you know what I have been doing. We have been kept very busy, as you will have seen from the other team members’ blog entries, so I will try not to repeat anything they have already mentioned!

My host in Mangalore is a laparoscopic surgeon and I was lucky enough to watch him perform two operations and attend his rounds at several hospitals and a private clinic. The main thing that stands out for me is the relationship between the patient and professional. At times, it almost seemed like they were part of one family, as they all spoke to each other with such ease, respect, and friendliness. Even when in pain, or simply concerned about their health, patients always had a smile on their face, and appreciated the doctor’s advice and reassurance.

Although many of the buildings and furnishings I have seen look dated and dirty (i.e. dusty floors, stained linen, etc.), and would not be deemed acceptable in the UK, I was informed that infection rates are lower than in the UK. I looked at a hospital’s infection control policy and was pleased to see its level of detail and clarity. At another hospital, I saw state-of-the-art equipment and facilities and was impressed with an intensive care unit where each patient had their own room and nurse.

The lengthy waiting times we experience in the UK do not exist here. I visited two casualty departments, one on more than one occasion, and I was surprised by how quiet they were. However, I was told that they do get busy, particularly with victims of road traffic accidents. Diagnostic tests and surgical procedures are carried out quickly. In the private clinic my host worked in, patients were able to just walk in and see a consultant.

With a population the size of my county (Cumbria), the vast number, and type, of hospitals in Mangalore is extraordinary. There are also several medical colleges and I caught sight of some students working on a cadaver whilst being shown round one of the colleges!

Aside from the vocational visits, I have enjoyed many activities: a short ride in an auto-rickshaw; a trip to the cinema; an ayurvedic massage; attempting to do the highland fling and play an Indian flute (not at the same time!) in Moodabidri; tasting different flavours of cashew nuts; drinking the best coffee I have ever had in Kushalnagar; and seeing elephants.

The food all of my host families and fellow rotarians have prepared for me has been wonderful and I have really appreciated all their efforts to make sure the food is not too spicy! I am looking forward to seeing everybody again soon at the rotary conference.

Golden Temple
13 January 2013

Our final day in Kushalnagar and it starts early in my home, with loud music, as it is Sunday, the traditional day of worship. I enjoy a traditional Kerala dish for breakfast, rice with green bean curry and then rice with banana and sugar. The bananas here are delicious. It is followed by a dosa and coconut milk chutney. Enjoying this food a lot! Jeny is at mass this morning so I don’t get a chance to say goodbye and Preeth is ill unfortunately.

We are taken to visit two of the towns 18 Buddhist temples. The Tibetans were gifted some land here after their escape in 1959 and they have a community of around 30,000, including 10,500 monks. The temples are beautiful and even though they are a tourist attraction, they are quite peaceful and me and Di spend some time sitting cross legged on the floor taking it all in. That is until we are approached again by locals who want their photos taken with us! This is becoming a regular occurrence and it is obviously because there are very few westerners in this area. It is fairly untouched by international tourists and only
At the temple
attracts local tourists from Bangalore and the surrounding area. When we go shopping, we come across a lot of beggars, including women with children, sitting in the red hot mid day sun. We have been quite protected from this sight up until now as we have not visited many tourist attractions. At the second temple, which seems to be closed to the public, we are able to visit the Dalai Lamas private residence which he uses around twice a year. It is very basic and peaceful. I didn’t know much about the Dalai Lama before but am interested to learn that he is now 77 and has been the Dalai Lama since he was two years old. I am told by a wife of one of the Rotarians that they Buddhists are looking for a new Dalai Lama and they choose a youngster with exceptional talents, who can teach, be knowledgeable and lead the community. They thought they had found such a gifted child but he turned out to be unsuitable. I find this quite hard to get my head around to be honest. How could a community choose a leader at such a young age? Lunch is at a
Mysore Palace
lovely Tibetan restaurant and when I ask for the wifi code it is freetibet2013. Very interesting!

We have to say goodbye to our hosts in Kushalnagar today and move on to Mysore. We have had a nice time in Kushalnagar and all of the hosts here, as well as their families, have looked after us very well. It takes around two hours to get to Mysore, which is a tourist area with a rich history and lots of royal connections. We are staying in the Mysore Sports Club for two nights to give is all some much needed rest. Tomorrow is a national holiday here so it fits in well. I think Nicola must know that I am tired and struggling little today so she has been feeding me ‘Gems’ which are the Cadbury equivalent to Smarties over here, and they still contain all of the E numbers that were removed from our sweets at home a couple of years ago! After being met by Rotary Club members, enjoying more food and tea, we head to our rooms, and then on to watch the lights at Mysore Palace. The lights are only on at the weekend so we have
Well deserved refreshments
to make sure we see it today. Between 7pm and 8pm the Palace is decked out with millions of lights and thousands have turned out to watch. It is very impressive and a brass band is playing British music. I think this is just a taste of what is to come in Mysore.

Tonight, we were able to enjoy some refreshments while watching Premier League football on a big screen outside. A little taste of home but with better weather! It doesn’t take me, Emily and Nicola long to get talking to some locals who engage in a very interesting debate about our very own Royal Family. The locals are very passionate and keen to learn why we are defending our Royal Family. We explain that they are good for our economy as one of our biggest tourist attractions and that their presence in 2012 helped to unite the nation during a difficult period. They seem to have other opinions and our attempts to change the subject don’t seem to work here! What they have to say gives us some food for thought at least!

Bath time
12 January 2013

Our first and only full day in Kushalnagar and we have a busy schedule. First stop is the Dubare Elephant Camp. The twenty elephants here are owned by the Karnataka Forestry Department and used to help move wood in the forest. After the initial excitement of seeing a forty year old daddy elephant and a two year old baby (too cute!), we are a bit shocked to see that they are chained together and struggle to walk far. Their eyes are also watering which makes them look so sad. They each seem to be assigned a handler; some are just young boys with sticks which have a metal hook on one end. They use these to drive the elephants and move them down towards the river. Some sit on the back of the elephants and the elephants helpfully raise their leg as a step to help the handler mount. We have been joined today by a large group of local Rotarians and their families and little Jefy is here too. She is quite a character and is very cheeky! She is a great dancer and also likes music. She tells us that she isn’t scared of elephants
Cooling down
but she is scared of crocodiles, there is one in her river at home apparently, so she chooses not to come into the water!

Me, Emily and Nicola brave the cold water and help to scrub down the elephants as they bathe. They are beautiful, timid creatures with hard and hairy skin. Despite the chains and sticks, they seem to be looked after well and we are able to help feed them some of their daily food intake (and they take a lot!). Instead of taking the boat back to the other side, some of us walk back across the shallow river. It feels great to be out in the sunshine! Although it’s 30 plus degrees here, we have spent most of the trip indoors so far.

The one disappointing thing about India is the rubbish which lines every street and roadside. It’s no different here and this beautiful river has its banks spoilt by litter. Next stop is a coffee research centre run by the government. I’m not a coffee drinker so it is strange to find out that coffee actually comes from a fruit. I had no idea! We head for lunch at Green Dreams, an

environmentally friendly farm retreat which is still trying to establish a reputation as a family resort which is sustainable in every way. They tents used as the accommodation are beautiful inside and this looks like a great place to come for a relaxing weekend away. The food we eat is organic too and cooked on traditional fire stoves.

In the afternoon we visit two coffee factories and some of the group get to taste the fresh coffee. It is a long process to create the coffee products. I had no idea about this. Visiting all of these factories really makes outthink about how the food products we consume make it to our plate and how many miles they have travelled in the process. We are all given some to take home as a gift.

Tonight we have given our third presentation to a Rotary Club and it goes well. We get some good feedback and many of the questions are aimed at Emily in the agriculture sector and Nicola in the food area. The club have made this a special event for us and they have brought their families along to enjoy a bonfire too. Rotary clubs here

have a much younger average membership and they provide regular activities for the whole family. It’s all a bit much for little Jefy who is sound asleep!

Rotary playschool
11 January 2013

Apparently I have an amazing knack for falling asleep almost anywhere! I slept for most of the ten hour flight from Heathrow to Bangalore, I got a good hour or so at the airport with my head in my lap, I catch 40 winks after lunchtime most days when we are travelling from place to place and today I have managed to curl up like a cat on the bus and have a couple of hours sleep on our long and bumpy (Indian roads are amazing!) journey from Mangalore to Kushalnagar.

I had a few tears again while saying goodbye to the Banker family in Mangalore. I managed to join Punit’s mum and dad for breakfast and they gave me a beautiful gift to send me on my way. Everybody is just so kind and I have really enjoyed my time with Punit, Rupal and their family. Hopefully we will get a chance to meet up with them again before we leave India. The hospitality I received from them was amazing and it was so kind of them to share their home and their life with me for the past four days.

On the road
My home for two days
to Kushalnagar (once I wake up!) I see my first wild monkey at the side of the road. Apparently they are as common as rabbits or pheasants to us at home. Wild Boar are also a problem here and they are protected by the government. Still a bit sleepy, we arrive in Kushalnagar, a much smaller town than the two places we have been already, and are welcomed with sandalwood garlands which smell amazing! We visit the play centre which is supported by Rotary and then meet our hosts for the next two days.

We are understandably nervous each time we are introduced to our hosts and head off alone with them to meet their families. So far, so good though! I am living with Shibu Thomas and his wife Swapna, their children Jeny, 11, Jefy, 5 and grandparents Abraham and Alice, as well as some dogs and a random cow strolling around outside the front gate. They live in a beautiful home at the end of a quiet track which sits just beside the river (which apparently has crocs so I’m staying away!). Shibu is a civil engineer and designed this house himself nine years ago.

Preeth
Refreshments
is Shibu’s cousin and she will also be staying for the next couple of days. Preeth recently married a British Indian man and he has left India today to return to work in the UK. He had been visiting for Christmas and New Year and Preeth, a doctor, will join him once her visa is approved. It is taking a while, considering she applied at the start of September! Preeth goes through her wedding photos with me and explains that she wore a wedding dress for the service but more traditional Indian dress for the evening reception.

The Thomas family are Christians and their house reflects this, including the nativity scene in the garden. Shibu is shocked when I tell him that I am not religious and that none of my circle of friends attends church regularly. I think that Indian people have a perception that the UK is a very religious country and are surprised to hear different. When I show them my photos from home, they find it hard to believe that people get married in hotels or on beaches and ask who is responsible for the marriage if it’s not the Church. Jeny, who is very
Lovely south Indian cuisine
fashion conscious and had four outfits on before we left for dinner, has her first Holy Communion soon and she must also start to learn about confession.

We all meet up at a lovely modern hotel to enjoy some dinner. Each member of the team is here with their host families and we are also joined by other Rotarians. The food is nice and we get to spend time getting to know the families. One of the daughters, who is 22, is explaining that she will soon need to start thinking about marriage and she wants her parents to arrange one for her. 75% of marriages in India are still arranged.

Even though I’m Scottish, I’m not a whiskey drinker as so many people here seem to be. But tonight, Preeth has me converted and I manage to enjoy a whiskey and apple juice. I’ll certainly be trying some of these at home too! Bed time for now, if I can sleep!

As we all got up early to go to the beach and paddle, we were all to chicken to swim! We had a typically English paddle, rolled up pants that always fall into the water. We looked at the beach huts and watched the jet ski's. Back to hosts for showers and breakfast and off to Moodabidri. Fantastic warm welcome, handshakes and flowers. We were taken to Soans pineapple farm where I had pineapple more tasty than ever before! A strange fruit called the miracle fruit that turns everything you eat after it sweet tasting, must take some home!! The timber yard was amaxing, the carving at inlays just beautiful, if I could have carried a door on my back I'd have bought one! We were given fantastic areca nut garlands which will be kept forever in my house. The medicinal herb garden was really interesting and the fermentation room smelled like beer and christmas cake!
The hospitality was heart warming and I look forward to seeing them again at the end of January!
I had a city tour last night and saw some places not quite on the map for tourists, I loved the mixture of the old parts sitting in between huge apartment blocks, there is so much to see in this city it would take weeks to see half I think! I was taken to get Mendhi on my hands, it took 10minutes and looks beautiful! The guys that did it should go into cake decorating, the speed they piped such intricate designs-wow!
Anyway, it's time for breakfast and another day out. Oh yes, Happy Birthday for yesterday again Dad x x

Ram in his office at the tile factory
10 January 2013

The traditional industries of Mangalore are clay tiles, cashew nuts and beady (not sure if that’s the correct spelling!) which we are told is a form of cigarette, rolled in a leaf. Apparently many of the men in the families used to spend their weekly wages on alcohol so the woman would roll beady at home to sell and support the family while she cared for the children. Today we are visiting a tile factory and cashew factory to learn more about them.

Ramkrishna has been looking after us for the past few days and we visit his family tile factory, UMA Tile Company, which opened in 1947. Ram used to work here when he was younger during his school holidays. He knows the business inside out and runs it now with his father. The first tile factory in Mangalore was opened in 1930 by the missionaries. Mangalore has much lighter clay which is used for roof tiles and building blocks. At one point there were 60 factories here but now there are just seven left. Tiled roofs are much less popular now as blocks of apartments with flat roofs are popping up all over the
UMA Tile Company
city. Ram has 30 products and his main market is in Mumbai and Bangalore and he mainly deals with direct customers and end users. Each tile is worth about 15 rupees (not much) and tiling the roof of a large house would cost around £300! The factory is impressive and I still can’t believe that we can come into these places and look around without any worried about health and safety. We even stand on top of the kiln and look down into it! The process is good to watch and one member of staff taps and looks at each and every tile to mark it into one of 11 classes. How he manages this I have no idea. They all sound the same to me! Poor quality tiles won’t pass the test as they will crack when exposed during the hot sun and then the rainy season.

Randomly, Ram tell us that the workforce in India sometimes choose not to turn up to work. All of his staff have to be trained in every area of the factory so that it can still operate when staff fail to show up. It seems that this is common and at
Working the kiln
the Cashew factory, owner Prakash tell us the same thing. He employs 225 people but on any normal day, around 200 will turn up for work. Employment law here always works in favour of the employee so this is acceptable it seems!

Cashews came to India from Brazil when the Portuguese wanted to test the quality of the soil. Not so long ago, the nut industry was struggling as people were worried about the fat content of cashews. Now, people are realising the benefit of snacking on them. Before the trip, I didn’t really like cashews but I have to admit that I’m a convert. We tasted around four flavours here, including honey, roasted and black pepper and they are all fab. I have lots to bring home!

Again, the process is amazing to watch and although the factory is modernising and new machinery is visible in every department, most of the work is still done manually. One cashew only has a 22% yield but the shell is never wasted and the oil is extracted to be used as fuel, which Ram uses in his tile factory. It is a seven day process from cooking the nuts to
Cashew factory
packaging and distributing. Again, nothing is wasted as the broken nuts are used in food and sweet products. Prakash sells his products mainly to Indian markets and the Japanese as they like quality rather than quantity. His business is booming but labour costs are increasing quickly and competition is rife in Vietnam and in India too. In the state of Karnataka alone there are 400 cashew factories.

After lunch, where we see a tattooed man (very rare to see here) and hear some English music, (old, but still, it’s music!) we head to an artisan village where we see people making traditional items using a hand loom, a pottery wheel and bamboo. It’s also a chance to buy some traditional gifts! I buy Dev and Rahul some traditional wooden toys which are good for hand eye coordination, so maybe I’m supporting the Indian cricket team of the future!

Back at home (it feels like home!) Punit and Rupal take me out to their favourite drive in restaurant. It’s strange to see people with cups and saucers in their car rather than disposable coffee cups. They are right though, the food here is delicious. Can’t believe it’s my last
Traditional skills
night with them here in Mangalore. It’s a lovely modern and vibrant city and I really like it. We have our second Rotary meeting tonight and we deliver our presentation which is received well. We also get a chance to meet two of the Indian GSE team who are travelling to Cumbria and Lancashire in April/May. They are both lovely and we offer them some advice about the weather! One man also approached me and Di to tell us that his brother works in the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle and he has been there for 30 years. Amazing!

Punit takes me for one final drive around town on the way home and we discuss the city, the fact that I am learning my way around already, and we have a discussion about the differences between Muslims and Hindus. I think that most people at home in the UK don’t understand the difference and associate all Asians with the worst side of the Muslim religion we read about in the press. Punit shows me his old family home which is now surrounded by towering apartment blocks. However, it seems that the house has also been sold for development land and

Pineapple juice bar
Didn’t think I could top the brownie last night but today Rupal gave me some of her aunts home made mint chocolates and then made her own brownie for desert tonight! Yum!

Our schedule today said that we were heading to a Jain temple at Moodabidri but the unexpected (or now expected!) happened again and we landed at a Rotary meeting in the town. The people welcomed us warmly with flowers and then told us the plan for the day; a pineapple farm, a wood factory, lunch and then a herbal medicine centre.

The pineapple farm has a long history and the family owners also grow lots of other plants and fruits on their land, as well as having a beautiful guest house. Farmers here really have to think of innovative ways to use their land and make the most of their crops as it is so dry most of the year but the land floods in the monsoon season. At the juice bar, we taste some fresh pineapple juice before having a tour of the site. It is so interesting to learn about where our food comes from! Eating the fresh fruit is an even better experience. It
Lunch
tastes so much better than our own.

We arrive at the wood factory and the company and house are owned by Rotarians. I have never seen so much beautiful wood in one home! We are invited in and given a garland of varnished nuts. We also make presentations to each of the Rotary members who are here. And there are a lot. After entertaining us with some Tulu songs, we are asked to entertain them. We haven’t prepared anything but Emily and Di come to the rescue with a cobbled together version of the Highland Fling. Di also has a go at playing a local flute! Go girls!!

Lunch is amazing and followed by more fruits than I have ever seen in one place. The highlight of my day here is watching the craftsmen at work in the factory. It’s great to see how an item starts and then the end product, all in one place. The attention to detail is amazing and these men are very skilled workers. Some of the pieces we see take around two months to complete and include brass and pearl inlays. I think we are all considering shipping some items home!
Workers carving the wood

Next stop is the Jain temple of 1000 pillars. Again the granite carvings are amazing and have stood here for hundreds of years. It is amazing to think about the history behind these places of worship. Last stop is the herbal medicine factory. The products here are natural and we see the fermentation process as well as the machines used to turn the medicines into tablet form. Many of the items here look like the type of things we buy in Holland and Barrett.

It has been a long day and I head home, back to my host family in Mangalore. Rupal and Punit spend some time explaining the area where they pray in their home. They talk about the various idols which they pray to and tell me that their religion has 30,000 different gods. No wonder I can’t get my head around it. They all pray here every day and ring a bell within the house too. Later, I spend some time outside trying to play cricket with the boys. I think its safe to say im not very good but the boys do try not to laugh at me! They learn cricket at school and Dev
Bat it like Botham
is particularly good. After a run around the town in the car and some snacks at a drive thru, we eat dinner and then I spend some time with the boys, who call me auntie. They tell me that they have eaten and thoroughly enjoyed the first stick of Blackpool Rock. I use Google images and maps to show them my house, my street, some of the sights in London and also tell them all about snow. They are fascinated. I hope I have made two pen friends here too!

Me and Dr. Ravichandran
8 January 2013

I’m learning lots about life in India, including the frequent power cuts. We have another while I’m in the shower this morning! The family are keen to learn lots about like in the UK too including jobs, the recession, minimum wage, cost of living, lifestyle, hobbies and family circumstances. Much of this is very new to them. The economy in India is booming and people here are not worried about jobs. From what people are telling me, the Government here don’t seem to be supporting some of the things you would think they would, like rubbish collection. The Government used to collect road tax annually but now ask for 15 years worth in one go to help fund projects. It is ironic really because on our travels we have seen countless half built bridges and road works which have been abandoned due to lack of funding.

The driving here leaves a lot to be desired! Apparently anybody can pass a test and there is not any real system of learning to drive. That is quite clear. It also seems to be ok to drive without a seatbelt and while using a mobile. We have almost killed
Shopping Mall
a dog already and have also been sat in the middle of a road tooting at a car opposite, both refusing to move! Yet, the only police I have seen are traffic coordinators. They can’t be doing a very good job!

On the way to the vocational visits, Punit shows me the local railway station. Its packed with commuters and school children. There are also a lot of people walking on the tracks and he tells me that they use it almost as a pavement. We pass the tax office and the newly renovated and very White House like council buildings. Despite paying 30% tax to the Government, the workers in India are yet to see much return. Most have private healthcare and pay privately for their schools. The Government are seen as corrupt and if too many people are too well educated, they might start to ask questions about where their money is being spent. Punit’s sons had to sit an entrance exam to attend their school, and as well as making a donation, fees must be paid. Parents do this willingly as education in India is one of the most important things for families.

Punit owns
The lovely Rupal and Punit
a plywood factory with his dad, a 67 year old who is yet to retire! They employ around 20 people from northern India as many people in Mangalore will not take manual labour jobs. It is very much an educated city and people work for banks or IT companies. Punit pays his staff well and provides accommodation for them. Most of them choose to work more than the usual eight hours so that they can make money to send home or support their families who have moved here with them.

Today I visited three companies based in Mangalore with Punit. The first is Diya Systems, a subsidiary of Glowtouch. They provide software solutions including, including application development and web hosting, to companies across the world. They have 980 staff, including 60 in Kentucky in the US. I love the story behind third company. And despite its humble roots and family values, it is an impressive building with fingerprint recognition for staff and a hotel attached to it for international clients. Dr Ravichandran says that the company started with just three people and one computer. Now, just over a decade on, they have more than four million customers. Dr Ravichandran
Yum.....
is a philanthropist and the whole ethos of the business is the support the community. He spends 40% of his own time and more than 100,000 rupees (£1000) each month on community investment. He employs local people and recruits local graduates for the specialist roles. He trains them and offers them accommodation, transport and a free canteen. There are incentives linked to service and quality and staff are recognised for their achievements. They communicate in a variety of ways and have an open floor. I am really impressed by his values and they fact that he is leading his staff in the same direction, including them in his projects. He even has the beginnings of a CSR report which is great to read. As well as employing disabled people, he also provides education for the children of his own personal staff. Dr Ravichandran tells me that he learned these values from his grandmother and he is passing them on to his own four grandchildren.

We also visit Flexiresources, a software development company, and Magnum, an advertising agency, both of which are local businesses performing fantastically in international markets. The graduates here are enthusiastic, positive and eager to explain the projects they are working on. I have found that while the standard communication methods are lacking, they make up for it by emphasising face to face communication. There are also lots of incentives for people to do well here and improve performance and output. These businesses tell me that they have not really been affected by the recession in the west as big companies still need their services to stay up to date with technology.

I am interested to read on the front of the Times of India that a spiritual leader has caused controversy here by claiming that the Delhi rape victim could have prevented the attack by holding the hands of the accused and calling them her brothers, asking them to stop. Much of India will be outraged by this claim, as the newspaper explains.

Punit drops me off at a local clinic and my time here could be described as fairly traumatic! Everything from my first experience with an Indian toilet (I have done well to avoid it for a week!) and then the ayuverdic massage I receive. I will keep this one for my personal diary! The shopping with Rupal afterwards makes up for this and I spend what seems like a fortune (but is actually next to nothing) on 100% silk scarves, bracelets, trinket boxes and other bits and pieces. Malls are popping up here all the time and are packed with fashionable clothes stores, bowling alleys and cinemas. Rupal is good at bartering the prices down for me. Rupal also gives me some traditional Indian earrings, a beautiful bracelet and some local cashew nuts. What a lovely family they are. I hope they like the delicacies I gave them; Kendal mint cake and Blackpool rock!

Tonight, we headed out to a local restaurant with the rest of the team and their hosts. I try lots of different dishes and even manage to sneak in some wine and an amazing chocolate brownie. Yum! I can’t believe that I was worried about what I would eat. I could get used to this cuisine!

View of Mangalore
7 January 2012

Before anybody mentions the spelling and punctuation, we are writing so much in the short time that we have, we don't always have time to proof read. Sorry!



After an epic breakfast with Mithra (about seven courses of Indian food, including two sweet courses!) we are sent off on the bus back to Mangalore. It is an emotional farewell and as soon as Emily starts crying, me and Nicola follow! I hope this shows our hosts how much we have appreciated their hospitality. They have looked after us so well that I have already told my mum I want to stay here! To thank Mithra, I gave her some Kendal Mint Cake, a Cumbrian slate coaster and a postcard of Ullswater. I also left a letter and some Blackpool Rock for Geethra, my ten your old friend, in the hope that she will write to me. Mithra gave me a beautiful candle made in Udupi and a book about acupressure, something she is very enthusiastic about. And if I can look that good at 73, I will be too. I might even take up her early morning yoga habit! Mithra has asked me to
A temple for every caste
come back for a honeymoon one day and I hope that I will see her again.

In Mangalore, we are taken on a tour of the city. First stop, a Church, hand painted inside by one man. It took him two years and five months to complete and the attention to detail is stunning. Unfortunately we can’t take any photos in most of the religious places here so you just have to take my word for it. We are then taken up endless flights of stairs to the top of the tower of the adjoining school. The winding and wobbly stairs are worth the panic as we see panoramic sights of Mangalore. It really is a beautiful city. We take in the ship building yard, hospitals, busy streets, apartment blocks, and even some very dodgy health and safety on a nearby building site!

We go onwards to two temples. Here, we have to sip holy water, have a powder applied to our heads and contemplate the rituals before walking out backwards. Many people come here each day to worship. Some believe that one of the shrines will boost fertility and we see women praying there. The second temple
Beautiful
is busier and brighter. It was built by a lower caste to offer an opportunity for everybody to worship. In the past, only higher castes of society were allowed to enter some temples. At the temple, children swarm round us, asking where we are from. They want to have their photo taken with us and then see it on the screen. These are not poor children. They wear nice school uniforms and are from middle class families. However, this area does not see many western tourists and they are fascinated by us and our pale skin. It feels strange to be the minority for once. Some of the children follow me into the temple asking for English coins. None of us have any but they are happy with the Rotary pens I give them. An older lady also asks us for English coins for her collection.

After lunch with Devdas and his family, we head to a school for children with disabilities. The school does not receive any Government funding and they are hoping that Rotary International will help to fund a new school bus for them. There are 90 children here of different ages. Some board here but
Angie swarmed by children
others travel miles to come and the current school bus is insufficient. The children are amazing and welcome us with music and garlands of flowers. We also have a bindi applied and a flame ritual is carried out by the school prefect. Inside the classrooms we are met with happy and well behaved students. Each class has no more than eight students and they are each involved in different activities. In one of the classrooms I am moved to tears by a girl, no more than six years old, as she greets the principal of the school. It is clear to see that these children are well cared for and are learning new and useful skills here. The money which Rotary could donate would perhaps be a small amount at home, but here, it really could achieve a great deal.

My second host comes to pick me up and take me to his family apartment in a nice residential area of Mangalore. Punit is married to Rupal and they have two children. Dev is 12 and Rahul is ten. They have a lovely home and welcome me with yet more Indian hospitality! This will be my home for the
A welcome party at the special school
next four nights and I’m keen to get to know the family. They tell me that they married 16 years ago. It was an arranged marriage and they met one year before the wedding. Rupal moved from Bombay to be with Punit and his parents, who live in a separate apartment in the same block. The children go to a nice co-ed school and take part in lots of extracurricular activities. They also love cricket! I get them on side by mentioning that I know that India beat Pakistan last night. (Mitra and Mr Shetty made a lot of noise during the game!)

Punit and Rupal take me to see a nearby Church which is more than 300 years old. There is a wedding taking place and Punit explains that his brother married a Christian girl from India and they had a wedding which celebrated both of their faiths. The day started with a Hindu wedding like we have seen this week, and ended with a Christian service in this very Church.

We go on to see the old port and I ask them to show me the local fire station too. This is partly because I am
In the classroom
interested in these things and partly to impress my dad, a former fire-fighter at home. There are about five machines here to cover the Managlore district of 600,000 people. At any time, there are 15 men working in the station and each machine needs a team of seven. They work twelve hour shifts here for 15 days at a time. They let us come inside the new and very modern building and explain that when somebody dials 101, it comes directly to the station. They ring a bell on the wall only once (They show me how this works!) and the fire-fighters can be in the machines and on the road in 50 seconds. I am surprised that they have to dress in their full uniform, minus the boots, as soon as their shift starts and ready to respond at any minute. Surely this must be hot and heavy? But it all makes sense when I see their uniform....a brown shirt and brown trousers. Not exactly safety gear! There are very few fires in Managlore and sometimes they sit and wait days before a call out. On the way home, we stop off for some coconut milk. Once the coconut
Happy children
is dry of milk, it is split open and the inside is offered to me. I willingly eat it when Rupal explains that it is good for your complexion!

Beautiful flowers
6 January 2012

We are quickly learning that plans seem to change as quickly as they are made. Today, we thought we were going to visit some temples. Instead we landed at a Rotary Club meeting about 15km from Udupi in Brahmavar where we received yet more beautiful flowers and were asked to talk about ourselves. The English here is different and it is quite difficult to understand what people are saying. I do understand when they take us downstairs to the cake shop and ask us to pick anything. Unfortunately it’s a case of ‘can’t eat, won’t eat’. Nicola can’t eat cakes, and I was advised to avoid anything from street caterers. It takes all my willpower to say no!! We are taken to a research farm, part of Bangalore University. The presentation and tour are great but my highlight is the cocoa beans. Our Brahmavar hosts choose to call me Chocolate Girl after this! The temples, one Jain, one Buddhist, are very interesting. It would be good to know a little more about the background though. Most of the signs are not in English.

While on the bus with our hosts, they are asking us about our
Mmmmmmm.....
personal circumstances and are amazed to hear that I don’t live my parents and I am unmarried. I explain my family situation and they say that we should all be living together, including my mum, dad, brother and other brother with his wife and two children! They continue to question me about it and find the situation hilarious! They even ask if perhaps my Dad will find me a husband? I hope not! This does start to worry me when they take us to our second wedding of the trip and I’m a bit concerned that it’s actually going to be my wedding. Tomorrow I’m wearing a ring!

At the wedding I come across my first Indian style toilet. I think I have done well to avoid even seeing one properly for four days! Although it’s clean, I decided to wait. Emily took the initiative to check the other toilets and we find two western ones beside the four Indian style loos!

We have some free time with our hosts and Mr Shetty takes me and Mithra out. I should have been staying with Mr Shetty and his family but due to a death in the family, my

host was changed to Mithra. We go on a rustic boat ride down the river which is fantastic. Very peaceful and serene. We then head to Udupi beach where families have gathered to watch the sunset. It’s like no beach I have been on before. Most beaches are either crowded with tourists or deserted. This is simply hundreds of locals from inland who come to fly kites and splash in the waves. There are camel rides, tight rope walkers, Muslim women in veils and also Indian men holding hands, a sight which is becoming more common to me!

It has been a fantastic final day here and I really love Manipal and Udupi, the people, the cuisine, the sights and the university town atmosphere. I have become very close to Mithra already and she has told me lots about her family, her life here in India, her arranged marriage and her interests. She has been an excellent host and I have loved sharing her beautiful home. I’m going to be really sad to leave tomorrow.

5 January 2013

So many things happen each day that it is hard to keep track of them all and write them in the blog, especially when we don’t have wifi to keep updating it! If anybody wants a real and honest account they will have to ask to read my personal diary when I get home!

Today has mainly consisted of food and learning.

The Indian people are so friendly and hospitable that they insist on feeding us, a lot of food, all of the time. Much more than we are used to, including breads and potatoes for breakfast! We have all agreed that although the food is lovely, unless we start to say no, we will all come back much heavier than when we arrived.

I was lucky enough to visit the Manipal Institute of Communication today where I learned about the courses, the students and how they are recruited, how journalism and communication works in India, recent changes and a social uprising being started by the youth via social media. I am told that this is especially common now that people are talking about the recent gang rape in Delhi. The younger generation of
Manipal University
Indians want a voice now, more so than ever. I also learn about how the university interacts with the community and discover that staff here have the same communication issues as we do at our UK universities. I meet a 91 year old professor who still comes to work every day! I hope I’m not working at 91. He is somewhat of a celebrity in Southern India as he has been a reporter and editor for some of the biggest newspapers. I also find that some people disagree with page 3 of Indian newspapers. I curiously ask what page 3 is and I am told that it is gossip and celebrity news, with some women wearing revealing clothes. If only they could see our version of page 3!

The printing press in Manipal is very impress and gets work from across the world, including Penguin and Pearson. JK Rowling’s book, Casual Vacancy, was recently printed here and the Hindu version of ‘The Secret’ is currently on the press. There are also school book, calendars, leaflets and the most recent copies of Indian Vogue and GQ. The factory is run well and I am very impressed. Although, I doubt that
Dancing at Asare Centre
I would be allowed to do this in the UK without ear plugs and a hard hat!

In the afternoon we all met up to visit the Manipal University’s main campus and watch the virtual tour. It is impressive but starts to feel a little bit like propaganda. The university is one of the top five in India and they are keen to instil pride in the students. We also meet the Pro Chancellor who gives us all a rose. I have had more flowers this week than ever before. We then travelled up to End Point, a beautiful hill overlooking the city of Udupi. It was nice just to get some sunshine, the first we have been able to enjoy outside! We seem to be spending a lot of time indoors and travelling.

The Astare Centre is a home for people with disabilities and it is an eye opener. The people here are treated very well and the centre is clean and tidy. Everybody welcomes us with more artificial flowers which are made by the residents to help them develop their life skills. The centre is funded by the university and Rotary.

Tonight we also delivered our first presentation to two rotary clubs. It went well and was received well. We were given lots of gifts and we are all wondering how we will get everything home!

Angie signing the register at Asare School
Just to prove we haven't hidden Angie in a cupboard somewhere here are a few photos of her taken today at the Asare School. We have all been looking after each other, but we won't let Angie be in charge of the presentation clicker again!!! 😊

Asare School is for mentally challenged people and is sponsored heavily by the Rotary Club in Manipal and was set up as a joint initiative with Manipal University.

Children and young adults live here permanently and have lessons and recreation time together. They also make synthetic roses and plates to sell and raise money for the school. The vocational training offered allows some people to go on and lead independant lives and find a job.

It was originally set up by Jai Vittal - Estate Manager at Manipal University and named after his daughter who attends the school. He showed us round today and we met his wife who is a teacher at the school and his youngest son who is in the final year of his degree in Computer Science.

Rtn. Karunakar Shetty
As ever here in India there has been LOTs of food and I managed to have 5 meals today!!! My stomach is ready to burst!!! I had a very large breakfast this morning which consisted of:

- bowl of cereal
- 2 dosas (pancakes) with coconut chutney
- 1 omlette
- 2 slices of toast
- glass of lyche juice
- cup of tea

Normally I don't have time for any breakfast back in the UK so this is a lot of food for me and could last me all day!

Today we started our vocational visits and Rtn. Shetty picked me up at 8.15am (early rise for me on a Saturday!!!) and took me to visit Kajane Agricultural Farm. I met Natraj Hegde who is a very forward thinking 2nd generation farmer/businessman who grows coconuts, cashew nuts, rubber, mangosteen, rambutan and peppers. He is experimenting with multiple cropping systems to get maximum yield from his crops and efficient use of water and land. Although we can't grow such exotic crops here in the UK the concept is something many UK farmers could adapt.

After walking round the plantations (which even at 9am this morning were approaching
Areca nut tree on Kajane Farm
35 degrees!!!) we sat in the shade and I drank fresh coconut water straight from the shell with a straw. It was very refreshing and afterwards they cut open the shell and I ate the soft creamy inside flesh -delicious!!! Natraj also has a successful online business called Vanilla Mart , based in Tumbridge Wells, Kent selling vanilla products to UK and European markets.

Lots of photos were taken on the farm of me with my hosts and this was just the beginning of the photograpgy!!!

Rtn. Shetty then took me to a local tile factory that is run by a close family friend as unfortunately the visit to the AMPC weekly market and office was unable to happen today. I met the mother of the family in their house and even though her English was non-existant she was very kind and welcoming to me, with lots of hugs and hand holding. It was here my 2nd meal of the day appeared in the form of more dosas with a sweet filling known as Chana Dal witha side order of freshly roasted cashnew nuts and chilli tikki banana chips. The very kind lady then gave me a packet of
Mangosteen and Rambutan products
Don't think we can buy these in the UK - very exotic fruits.
the dosas and banana chips to take away with me!

Next we were supposed to go straight back to the hotel in Manipal to meet everyone for lunch, but Rtn. Shetty wanted to show me his house and let my try some of his special fried fish (meal 3). It was absolutely delicious and just the right ammount of spice, but did make us cough a lot in the kitchen as he was cooking it! Apparently his wife makes fun of him and says he only likes people who like fish! I guess I am in the good books then!!! I ate 2 pieces and tried desperately not to think of lunch a mere 10 minutes away!!! Rtn. Shetty is a retired banker in his 60's who teaches English part time at a school in his home town that educates poorer children. He also goes swimming every morning VERY early is a member of a Laughter Club - I really like the sounds of this concept and think we could use some of these clubs back in the UK!!!

Lunch (meal 4) at the hotel with all the GSE team and their hosts was again delicious, but I
Tile factory
think we were all strugging with the sheer volume of food. We did of course manage mains, seconds and even pudding with some ""gentle"" persuasion from our hosts! Afterwards we headed on a tour of Manipal University which was VERY impressive - a very different place to any of our UK univerisities and I got the impression that students were more committed to their studies and appeciated the opportunities available to them following graduation.

A very busy man called Jai Vittal showed us rounf the campus and he was always trying to make us hurry up and move on, but we were all taking lots of photos!!! He even introduced us to the Pro Chancellor - Dr Ballal - who is second in command under Dr Ramdas Pai who is the son of the original university founder Dr PMA Pai and had a significant influence of the development of Udupi and Manipal in general.

We didn't have long to get changed before heading out to our first Rotary Club meeting in India which was a joint event between Udupi and Manipal clubs. We were all very nervous about delivering our presentation for the first time to an audience of nearly 100 people. The difference for us was the outdoor venue with bright stage lights and l lots of mosquitos!!! We got all the technology working (Eventually!!!) and delivered without any hitches. We got presented with several roses from the hosting clubs and we also exchanged banners. Lots more photos were taken including group photos for each club with all members on the stage. We then ate dinner in the same place and was a wonderful buffet which again went down only using the right hand to eat. Meal number 5 of the day done and definitely no more room today!!!!

Onwards now to bed for me I am afraid as it's not after midnight and I must be at breakfast tomorrow for 8.30am.

Rajyotsava Day is celebrated in the Karnataka State on 1st November every year. It is usually celebrated the full month. The state emblem is Ganda Berunda and the flag comes in red and yellow. The deity on the bullock drawn chariot is Bhuvaneshwari is decorated with flower garlands and the persons leading the procession, played Nadaswaram. They wore the same colors attire. The big drums are called ""dolu"" with other musical instruments to compliment the parade. Cultural programmes, congregations of artists and poets are part of the festival. At some places, feeding of the poor is also organized.

Here is my story:

While I was making my way to the Travel Agency, I saw some men clad in traditional costumes, yellow turbans, holding musical instruments and walking the same path as I am. Soon after my driver turned to the right I could not see them in sight anymore but my heart was racing because I do not want to miss this opportunity to photograph them and put into my album. I love to see cultures of many, particularly the Indian cultures and traditional festivals. It would be ashamed if I miss this festival moreover this is my very
IMG_8375
first trip to India, I do not want to live in disappointments. Being there on the second day in Bangalore, I am kind of lucky to have stumbled something like this but I had to walk about two kilometers down the road, checking with by passers where about is this people that clad in traditional costumes with musical instruments. “Down the road where Lord Subramaniam Temple is situated "" said by some who can reply in English. I finally reached A. Nanjappa Circle where the whole troupe was waiting for me. Thank God! They have not started the festival. They must have been waiting for me. I thought with a happy smile.

Many Bullock carts to head the parade, devotees on top of the chariot arranging what was necessary to beautify the chariot and the musicians clad in colorful costumes with colorful turbans. Bhuvaneshwari is the deity. While the swamijis in prayers and offerings, the artists who were busily tending their make-ups, some dressed in striking patterns cat costumes with black underwear on the outside, clowns on stilts (if you don’t look up, you might think they are flag poles), men in drags – they are beautiful, with heavy
IMG_8384
make-up, beautiful headdress, glittering costume jewelries, Hindu symbolic patterns on their foreheads, and the visible patch of unshaven moustache against the red full lips makes them very special.

Yellow turban drummers posed with their “dolu” drums, which I found them very friendly and corporative to my request. I am enthralled by the size of the drums and I also wondered “Do they rolled and played the drum as they parade?” It is a long road to reckon with, all because for the love of their culture, festival and faith traditionally believe in, that was carried out joyously every year, a tradition since their forefathers.

Rajyotsava Day is celebrated in the Karnataka State on 1st November every year. It is usually celebrated the full month. A colorful event one must not miss when you are in Karnataka state. It may be a small troupe but the celebration is great, knowledgeable, an insight to festival not known to my world.

I am happy and glad to have “caught” on them in time to enable me to add in to my album of Beautiful India.

My Dream to travel and see the whole of India before I strike Gold.

The wedding
4 January 2013

So much has happened today that it’s hard to know where to start! I was woken up by a mixture if dogs barking, train going over the bridge and chanting or praying from a nearby home. We experienced Indian time when the plans and timings changed, something which is common here but makes everything feel laid back and relaxed.

We have a bus to use for the duration of the trip and our driver Nagaraj is to take us into the city of Mangalore. As we are driving in, we are able to see lots of things we missed yesterday. It is amazing that there is so much wealth and poverty living side by side. I have seen wealth before and I have seen poverty before, but never both so close together without anybody batting an eyelid. One minute we have cows and goats grazing by the roadside, small fires and people looking through rubbish, then we have expensive advertising, shopping malls and people immaculately dressed n bright and expensive clothes. Everything is very loud and the main noise is car horns tooting and the whistles of road police and parking attendants.

We arrive at
Wedding meal
the venue for our first Indian wedding! The father of the bride is a Rotarian and his 24 year old daughter is marrying a 27 year old man. Although arranged marriages still happen, they are less common and Rathi and Rajesh met through work and they are marrying for love. Both have university qualifications and will work once they are married. Rotarian Sathish and his wife Sapna talk us through the ceremony and answer our questions. It was interesting to learn that the groom changes the name of the bride to match the same letter as his first name. In todays case, both names began with ‘R’ but Sapna was called Tara before she married Sathish. They also have children, a son of 20 and a married daughter of 26 with the same initial. Sathish and Sapna had an arranged marriage, with suitable partners picked by their horoscopes.

The wedding ceremonies here last for days, with lots of celebrations and rituals include burning, henna, (more common in North India) washing feet, giving beads and hundreds of thousands of flowers, used as venue decoration but also as a garland for the couple and in the brides hair. We learn that
Wedding car
best man must be younger than the groom and we are told that if there are two boys or two girls in a family, the younger cannot marry until the older has. Similarly, the sons must wait until the daughters are married before they can marry, unless there is an age difference of more than five years. They also tell me that there are far fewer women in India and for every 200 men, there are just over 130 women, meaning that many young men can’t find a wife. The maternal uncles deliver the bride to her groom and she is paraded to the guests, and lifted towards him before a blanket is removed to reveal her. I feel very emotional watching this and the loud music and smells sweep you away.

Everybody must have a full stomach to wish the couple well and we are shocked to see just how many people are being fed. There are around 1000 guests and while some quickly eat at the buffet outside, many are sitting down in a canteen. Here, we are given a banana leaf to use as a plate, as well as around ten small meals, eaten with our
Udupi Temple
hands. We are also given a box of Cadbury sweets, some I have never seen before, with a sticker noting the name and date f the wedding. (Apparently the bride’s father is a distributor for Cadbury!)

All of the guests who are invited will turn up for just part of the ceremony as it lasts so long and takes place on various days of the week. Many people go to around 30 weddings per year but they are asked not to bring any gifts as their presence is enough. Also, if the couple are given gifts, they must note what they were given and then in the future return something worth more. This could end up a bit pricy I think! What has hit me most is the fact that people in India are celebrating their marriage with so many people, making family and friends the most important part of their day. At home, this isn’t always the case and more and more people put on a show but forget the real meaning of their marriage.

Our GSE organiser in India, Devdas Kamath, invites us to his home and tells us that he and his wife had an arranged marriage and married two months after they met. His mother and father have been married for 52 years. They met on the day of their wedding! Devdas and his wife show us their wedding album from 19 years ago which is similar to the wedding we seen today.

We then travelled about an hour north to Manipal and Udupi where we met our first hosts. We were all greeted by female Rotarians, mine a 73 year old lady called Mithra Bhandarkar. Mithra has two children, her son living in California and her daughter living in Mumbai, and four grandchildren. Mithra has lived alone since she was widowed seven years ago. Her husband was ten years older than her and she tells me that when she had her arranged marriage, this was normal. Now women have a partner just four or five years older. Mithra’s house is beautiful and sits back from a main road through secure gates. The home was her husband’s dream home as he grew up in a house with just two rooms. The house features an indoor fountain as well as indoor and outdoor balconies. Mithra now just uses the ground floor so I have the top floor to myself! She also has staff, a young woman aged 27 who lives in quarters below the main house with her husband, a construction worker, and four year old son. He is delighted to see a foreigner! Mithras helper only works in the mornings to clean and wash. Her own mother worked for Mithra for more than 20 years and Mithra greets the little boy like he is one of her grandchildren which was very nice to see. She also tells me that she had a driver for 22 years but she sacked him two years ago because he was stealing from her.

Mithra takes me to her ladies club, Manipal Mahila Samaj. She spends a lot of time between here and the rotary club and the hall where the meeting is held was named after her late husband. She also tells me that she is a donor to the rotary foundation and so far she has donated more than $60,000. During the meeting, Mithra unexpectedly grabs my hand and takes me up to the stage where I have to explain to all of the guests who I am and why I’m here! After introducing her friend Nandita, 42, they take me in the car. Although Mithra has said we might go some places, plans change quickly and they speak to each other in their own language so much of the time I am at their mercy, jumping in the car and wondering where we will arrive next!

They take me to see a car festival, which are basically floats or a parade. We are in Carstreet, ironically a street with no cars but eight small community temples and one large temple. Although I’m finding it hard to keep up with all of the religions and community names, I gather that each of the eight compete to take over the larger temple for two years. This celebration today happens twice a year and everybody crams inside to watch the rituals and catch a glimpse of the idol through a grate in the wall. He is decked in diamonds and there are candles everywhere. The bell ringing, chanting and praying is quite overwhelming and although I understand hardly any of what they tell me, it feels like a very spiritual place. After leaving the temple and visiting some shops selling many idols, I get a chance to see my first elephant. It dances for the people before blessing them!

We also bang into some friends of Nandita and Mithra and the children are fascinated by me. One of the children, Greetha, 10, is very intelligent and asks me what I think about the protests being made in Delhi and if I feel safe. I am shocked that she seems to know so much but she goes on to tell me how she feel about this and being a young female in India. Greetha is intrigued by my life in the UK and asks a lot of questions. She is sad to leave when we head back to Mithras. I have also spoken to a lady about family life in India and we discuss adoption and why it is not so common here. I have learned so much already!

Dr Gowri in her office at Sonia Clinic
It's so hard to believe that just over 48 hours ago we hadn't left UK soil and hadn't met any Indian Rotarians!

Everyone we have met is SO friendly and it would be impossible to name them all. People are so genuine and friendly out here and go out of their way to make us welcome.

Today we experienced our first Indian wedding and if I had to describe it in one word it would be - colourful!!!! More photos to follow in other blogs as I very unhelpfully left my camera at Devdas Kamath's house in Mangalore!

We were taken in our personal minibus this afternoon to the district of Upupi where we are staying for 2 nights and met our first set of hosts - who are all female Rotarians, many of them doctors. This is the first night we've not been staying as a group and although we were all aprehensive at initialy parting it only took a few moment to be in the host home to feel welcome and part of the family.

My host is Dr Gowri who is a very respected padeatrician in Manipal and Nicola is staying with her sister (also a doctor, but specialising in gynaecology) Dr Girija. We were both taken round the hospital which their father founded - Sonia Clinic - and saw their offices and consulting rooms. We also met their 86 year old father who still lectures at the medical college and lives right next door to the hospital.

Both our hosts are members of a local Ladies Club which meets once a fortnight and we were lucky enough to be invited to their first meeting of 2013 and greeted once again with open arms and many ""Happy New Years"". We were fed (again!!!) and watched the new committee being sworn in for duty.

Men at work
Once I had arrived again and spent a day alone in the office, It began to sink in how much has happen the past 4 years...

Peace Child was my first step into the world alone, my first adventure, the time when I first realised what was possible.

I think sometimes in England we lose what is possible and just do what is expected.

I'm not sure if by escaping every January, I am running away, recharging my battery’s or discovering something new, I guess its a mixture of all three.

Sometimes I wonder what it all means, deep I know but with the Ego and the voice inside our heads it so difficult to just be, be present be in the moment, I think sometimes when I’m lost in my thoughts, tight chested and anxious “Breath, let go and remind yourself that this moment you are living right now is the only one you know you have for sure” Sometimes it releases a little pressure,sometimes it make me smile, but honestly, I can remember the only time I’ve even completely been in the moment, it was here in India on the 11th of February 2010, I
The lovely Emily
was in Kanukamuri, the southern tip off India, the meeting of three seas, the home Hindu's say of Devti the female spirit of Hinduism. I was sitting on a wall on the coast looking out to sea, unimportantly Matt was beside me... The wind was blowing on my face, its strength, wild and free... suddenly, somehow my mind complexity cleared all I could feel was my breath, then I began to cry, no emotion had cause the tears it was I think a trastion to letting go. That moment was by far the calmest most peaceful moment of my life.



Sometimes I think maybe I’m hedonist, constantly searching for a perfect; life, moment, partner, feeling, job, home, state of mind.



So after that first day of just being on Friday the ….. I returned to the boys home, the interns at the moment had organised a Christmas meal for them all, all together they our 70 boys in the home at the moment,I wasn’t sure if returning was a massively good idea, I mean my last experience had been a whirlwind of emotions, the treatment of the boys had been something I had really
Boys home
struggled with but for some reason I hoped my boys were still there... for me maybe? I feel its because I was worried if they weren’t there where would they be... the boy I was hoping for the most was J avid, a shy undeveloped 13year old we had shared moments and story’s without words. As we approached the building a strange feeling overwhelmed me, fear I think.



That morning we made decorations, paper garlands, then at 1 o'clock the food arrived. The boys were made to stand in line as we organised the massive pots of chicken curry, rice, dal, chapit and sweets. Usually they would only eat dal so the chicken was a real treat for them.

After handing out the final plate I entered the room in which they were eating. Sat in lines they all wait until the last boy had sat down, then they chanted, maybe like a pray of thanks, it was such a beautiful moment, and sound. We sat and shared a plate of the food.



Straight after lunch we left and headed to Bern’s the director of peace child, it was a surreal experience a
Boys home on my 23rd Birthday
difficult one to comprehend straight away, none of my boys were still they, a partly there is a new law that they need to be sent home or somewhere else before 3 months is up.

The end of 2012... It had been such a difficult year in some ways, but so amazing also! I love new years and the start of a fresh calendar. Well, I dislike the last minute party plans and people making a huge deal out of NYE but I think it is important to take a moment to reflect on the past year and what you have accomplished. I remember a piece of paper I wrote with my goals that stared at me every day. If you don't make any goals, you certainly won't reach them. I set absurdly ridiculously huge goals...and guess what? If I had that little piece of paper with me right now, I could draw a line through everything I wrote down. That being said, ok, yes I wanted to travel for a year. Here I am, siting beside rice paddies hear a monkey pounce on the roof while I'm drinking terrible instant coffee in the middle of India. Be cautious of what you wish for because what you get will most likely exceed your own expectations 😊

Enough of my self introspective... Once again, I've waited too long to write a blog. Picking up where I left off, I arrived in Agra where the Taj Mahal is. Wow oh wow! What an incredible building. Made of solid, white marble and all of the inlay designs are from other stones. And guess what...when you step inside, it smells like roses. I woke up for sunrise to take some pictures and to see it. I didn't really have much of a choice because I had to leave that afternoon so sunrise seemed the best option. There is just something so special to watch the light change and the day begin...and it is just a bonus I get to do that while looking at some of the most beautiful buildings/sites in the world. After such a peaceful morning, I was all ready to travel down south for Christmas. Good thing I was rested because the 28 hours of travel was some kind of stressful adventure!

So I go to leave and apparently, the rickshaw drivers are on ""strike""...come on! Basically just a way to ask 5x the price and get it. So I'm in this rickshaw and he pulls over and gets a little guy missing one of his eyeballs on a bike to get me the rest of the way to the train station. Ahh at this point, I knew it was going to be an interesting trip...

I arrive and my train is delayed 7 hours. Normally, I wouldn't care, it's India...delays and things going not according to plan are expected. Trouble with this particular train being delayed is that it was connecting me to another train which was taking me all the way to Mumbai. My 2nd train had been booked solid for weeks (I booked it first day in India) and at one moment the wait list was over 800 people. So, crap, I can't miss it. I asked about my delayed train and the response I received was ""just jump on a train passing through and keep walking from car to car to avoid the ticket collector"". I am up for that challenge but not that day. So I race outside the train station and got a taxi to get me to the connecting station. And here is something fun, when you tell a driver in India to go as fast as possible...they most certainly do! I think the guy had his horn and gas peddle pressed all the way down for 1 hour of the 1.5 it took to arrive. I get out of the car at 5:13...my train was supposed to leave at 5:15. I was running through the station, which is not that easy because people are laying on the ground etc. hah ok so needless to say, I found the platform and no joke, as soon as I walked up huffing and puffing, the train pulls up. I heave my bag on, jump on the nearest car and zoom, the train is gone. This particular train was not late (shocking) and it paused for 60 seconds at the station (which is also rare because normally they sit for a long time in each town). At this moment, all i could do was laugh with relief and pray I was on the right train.

It only got more interesting because I was in a car with 49 men and myself. As luck would have it, all the seats face forward but at the very end of the car they are opposite so you are sitting facing everyone...guess where my seat was? So not only do I have to squish between two strange men, I provided some sort of entertainment for all the men to look at for the next 17 hours. Sorry to elaborate on this story, maybe it is not that interesting but it is an experience I will never forget.

I arrived in mumbai and had contemplated going site seeing for a couple hours. But let me tell you, the 1 hour I was out on the street and getting to the airport...I think that city does not need to be on my list of places to explore. I will watch it in slumdog millionaire and be content.

Within 10 minutes of landing in Goa, it felt like all the stress of the past 3 weeks just melted away. The beaches are beautiful, no pollution, and only the occasional honking of horns. So relaxing! It was the first Christmas I spent away from family, snow and festivities. I can honestly say, I didn't miss it TOO much. I feel horrible saying that, because obviously I miss my family and friends but Christmas time has become so focused on gifts, food and it is so built up that it was such a beautiful feeling just sitting on the sand with nothing, and simply being grateful. It also helped being in such a cool place. I went out on a boat and saw dolphins. How awesome is that??!!

The south of India is much more relaxed and easier! That is a relief because I was so close to booking a ticket out of India. So close! But I am really thankful I didn't. I met a group of travelers and have been moving from town to town with them. This town I'm in (Hampi) is one of the top destinations in India and I now know why. It has a mix of natural beauty and ancient beautiful temples. Thousands of years ago, a volcano erupted spraying massive boulders over the valley. So you can just stroll through banana plantations and come across rocks the size of two storey buildings. It is a really chill place and no alcohol is allowed, which really tones down the crazy backpacker scene. The group of us went for a walk yesterday and jumped in the river and floated back into town. I wish I could paint the picture but there was not a soul around, just palm trees, rocks and the water (which I accidentally swallowed some...oops). I can understand now why people fall in love with India (after a very rocky beginning 😊

3 plane flights

...........and here we are in Mangalore!?!

India is an amazing experience for the first time visitor - colourful and busy are the two words that immediately spring to mind. Along with all the beeping and cars on the wrong side of the road and stray cows we made it safely to the Mangalore Club where we are staying tonight. Air conditioned balcony rooms with fantastics views are a welcome sights after a 9 hour overnight flight!!!

We have lots of exciting experiences ahead of us over the next few days and hopefuly after a good nights sleep we will all be raring to go. We are all doing remarkably well on severe lack of sleep, but need to get our body clocks back to some normality soon!

Tomorrow we have been invited to attend a Hindu wedding in the city and witness the main part of the ceremony. There will be about 900 guests present, which is small for this part of the world. Normally weddings have over 1000 guests, which a far cry from the traditional church wedding in the UK. This is a surprise addition to our agenda
DSC_0038
and we're really excited to experience this part of Indian cullture. The wife of one of the Rotarians we met today will shaparone us at the wedding and explain/translate the ceremony for us which will be extremely useful.

Let's just hope we don't melt in the 32 degree forecasted temperature!!!

The food is a LOT spicer than any of us were expecting, but all of it is delicious and cooked from fresh. We are all learning to scoop up the food with our right hand (left hand for cleaning only!) which is a challenge for me as a lefty, using the chapati or naan bread. I think we will all increase our spice tolerance over the coming weeks and looking forward to trying the difference regional variations in dishes.

Well, the end of our first day here. I'm full of lovely food, what a fantastic way to start!
I've been given a new suitcase, Thank you very much again! I've also managed to break into Di's to rescue her computer.
If I can ignore the huge black spider that just ran in front of me, I might be able to get to my room to sleep!

The internal flight.....
After a very early start at Manchester, a short trip to Heathrow and five hours in Bangalore, we have arrived in Mangalore!

We were waved off this morning by District Governor David Simpson and his wife Janet, who both came to wave us goodbye. Despite some heavy suitcases and too much hand luggage, we all made it here in one piece. My nerves were nowhere near as bad as I thought they would be and I managed to say goodbye to everybody without any tears!

The first things that have stuck me are the amount of adverts in Bangalore airport for green and environmental initiatives. It seems naive but I didn’t consider that this would be a priority for people in India. Being in Bangalore still felt like being in an airport at home, except for the beautiful Indian jewellery in the duty free! I was also very surprised to see copies of Fifty Shades on sale within the airport, obviously Twitter has spread the word over here too.

We have all withdrawn some rupees, witnessed some sunshine (something we don’t see much of!) and also had our first experience of an Indian toilet. Nicola was first to
View from my room
The rail and road bridges to and from Mangalore
go and was shocked to open the toilet door at Bangalore airport to be faced by a small drain in the ground and a hose attached to the wall. Once she pushed the door further she did see the western toilet right beside the drain! I’m sure we will see worse during the next month! After crossing my fingers through a flight on a propeller plane, we have just been met at Mangalore airport by a large group of our hosts. They decorated us with a bindi each and a garland of fresh flowers.

We travelled to Mangalore Club hotel for a relaxing evening before the work starts. The hotel was occupied by the English and the names of the honorary secretaries since 1876 reflect this; Brown, Black, Morgan, Davies, Jackson........ We were all welcomed to the club with coconut juice fresh from the coconut but the lunch we enjoyed with the hosts from D.3180 was very spicy, and I had to keep remembering to use my right hand. It is certainly different!

The view from my room on the top floor is fantastic, not sure about the beehive though! We are going to spend tonight relaxing and catching up on sleep. We are all a bit excited as we have been invited to a traditional Indian wedding tomorrow. Around 1000 guests will attend a ceremony which will last throughout the day. I am looking forward to seeing Indian culture up close and personal and sharing in the couple’s special day.

The kind moustasted man with the newspaper sign with my name splet wrong probably made it a little easier last time, after 18hrs of travel, no sleep and an emerging sore thoat i was once again where i had stood almost 4 years ago, bewildered and praying not to be ripped off i threw on my pack and walked into the crowd of taxi men, my ill spoken Hindi and his inability to read made the location difficlut to get across and as the journey progressed i tried desperately to recognise something of the town i'd spent over a month in...
When i arrived at the peace child office i was once again greeted by Viji, a famalir face, she is the interns house mother she cooks, cleans and looks after you.
It was now 5am and without sleep and a qucik glace at Tamzin i flopped down on to the same wooden bed and prayed for sleep...
I woke at 12 to the sound of voices in the kitchen, Juile another intern and Sammy who works full time for Peace Child were having there lunch inbetween teaching at two local primary schools.
Tamzin and the other intern Emily were at the boys home and wouldn't be back until 6.30pm.
Half asleep i tired to strick up conversation but as i began to realise how much things had changed, my thought wandered and i kept myself to myself...
While i waited locked into the office i lay in bed listening to the sounds, breathing in the smells and feeling the heat, it was only a few weeks before that i was stood in a marque in Emmbankment Gardens on the South Bank planning a party for 1700, full face of make up and a smart black suit, yet here i was laying on a plank of wood in baggy green silk throues and a purple salwa.

People have asked me over and over again ""Why are you doing this documentary Loretta?"" After all, you already have a non profit that does this work and you're about to start your masters degree, you're coaching clients and have a little startup. Is it really worth it?! How is this documentary really going to impact in the world?

After being here in India I can tell you exactly why we are doing this and why it's so important.

If you haven't seen it yet (in the past couple posts from this trip) we are uncovering some beautiful gems who are going to be the fortune we need for a brighter future. They are girls and young women who are strong and making a change in the world. They are young women who are ready to make change. They are girls who are ready to shine and ready to dust off the debrie of systemic pressures and old belief systems that result in child marriage, sexual violations, misconceptions and views that females are a curse not a blessing. They are ready to fight for their freedom. They are ready to share their voice with the world.

If you've
O07A0972
been watching the news you might have seen that we've been in India at a time where girls and women's rights are being rallied for after a young woman was raped on a moving bus and thrown out the doors in New Delhi. There have been rallies across India to press the govenment for change. Unfortunately that 23 yr old girl died today. This has to stop.

In the last 12 days here in Bangalore, we've worked with 20 girls, ages 11-18. Girls who's safety challenges are no different than that young woman on that bus. In their slum alone women are trafficked and assaulted daily. At least one woman a month dies or is killed. Almost all go unreported because they are female. The girl child is the most vulnerable.

We've feel privileged to have provided these girls with leadership training skills and asked them questions that have challenged some norms. We've talked about safety, body development, communication, and carrying themselves with confidence. We've learnt about their dreams and their values. We've danced with them, we've made art with them, we've sang with them, eaten with them, laughed with them, and today shared some sad good byes.
O07A1575


We've been invited in homes. We've interviews girls, boys, women and men about their lives, their views, and their opinions about equality. We've heard some extremely sad stories and some very powerful ones. We've cried while filming. We've tried really hard not to laugh while filming (apparently I'm not a great sound technician cause I can't keep quiet).

We, as a team, have had some really interesting and intense conversations. We've been able to provide 25 girls with a Pads4Girls kit (so they dont need to stay home a week a month), over 12 hours of Passion Project leadership development training, and we've collected some inspiring stories that we believe will have a larger impact on those who will watch our film. We've also taken our mascot Passion (the sock monkey) on her first global trip, and used her to engage girls with laughter and create a diverse sense of community. (see pictures on our Facebook page )

I can't even put into words the impact this will have and has had not only on us but also on the girls.

Thank you to all our amazing supporters, without you, this would not be possible.

The
O07A2768
journey has just started and we need your continued support and energy. PLEASE help us make our Global Giving campaign a success. If we reach our goal we get to expand our outreach and become a vested program with Global Giving in the USA.

By Tia
We've now been in Bangalore for 6 days and already I know I'm leaving a piece of my heart here with the girls in Vivek Nagar slum that are connected with Global Concerns Leadership India .

Alot of international workers will say ""Once you've seen one slum, you seen them all."" I've heard that many times since starting international humanitarian work in 2008. I bet though they have not been here or met Brinda Adige. Here in Vivek Nagar slum, imparticular the area where Brinda created the Global Concerns India office (a small 10x20 sqft room with a metal garbage pull down door), the energy and the people are a little different.

Groups of women meet each month and share their concerns about their community, their health, their wellness, and that of their children, especially their daughters. On a regular basis their daughters, their neices, and neighbour's daughters go missing.

On a weekly bases a woman dies or goes missing. Abuse and violence is ramped. These women though, do their best to find and hold jobs, they tend to their children, they tend to their often abusive or drunk husbands, they care about their neighbours, and come together to talk regularly
Brinda
about the issues of violence, poverty, and spousal abuse. They want change and they want to be involved in the process. Brinda the founder of Global Concerns makes sure they know their rights. She fights for their freedoms. Brinda and her staff go out and find the missing children and ensure their school fees are paid for. They have created an effective leadership program like I have never seen before. Tia, Robyn, Reem, and I have been blown away at the devastation these girls and women face yet are in awe of the powerful community that Brinda has created.

In order for the girls to be able to be part of our program, the mothers needed to agree and they needed to sign our film/photo release forms. Brinda called all the women together. The mothers were quite concerned about the material we were going to cover because they wouldnt know how to answer any of their daughter's questions. We held a discussion, asked alot of questions of them, and they of us. It was such a moving circle. The women all agreed and actually insisted that Brinda also learn the Elements Of Sucess coaching program, so she could also
Mothers meetup
teach them. Brinda thanked me for creating more work for her. Before I leave I will be giving Maria and Zeena (Brinda's staff) a crash course on Passion Projects to add to their already amazing programs. I feel pretty honoured.

With the support of Maria and Zeena translating to the girls (most understand a basic English level) we have taught over 8 hours of Passion Project leadership training. We needed to break for Christmas holidays but will complete our training with an awesome art project that Tia created that ties into Passion Project leadership training (we'll post another blog before we leave). We will also provide the girls with a Pads4Girls kit and talk with them about honouring our bodies, our female energy, and hygiene. For maybe of you ""honouring our female energy"" might sound strange or airy fairy but the fact is that many girls here, when we asked them, would rather have been born a boy because it would have caused their families less troubles.

After all the interviews we have done, all the workshops, all the questions, all the observations I feel I could write another book (and perhaps I will after this documentary is completed).
Tia and Loretta with some of our training group
Until then we'll keep at it, with your support and energy.

Speaking of which we have 10 days left on our campaign for Vietnam and the Philippines . If we make our goal of $5000 and 40 unique donors we become a vested program that can grow and gain charitable support in the US.

There are a good number of you who read this blog and offer your support to us in many ways, today, we need your support to make this happen. For as little as the cost of a movie ticket you can make a difference.

Temple
So after travelling up the Western Ghatts through the mountains we took a 9 hour bus journey to Bangalore, which is one of the craziest cities I've been to in India, and then a 13 hour train journey to one of our target destinations Hampi. It was definatly NOT what we expected! after travelling around the cities and towns of India Hampi was a welcome break from dusty roads and extremely busy city and town centres.

Hampi is famous for its temples and the amazing rock formations that surround the area. We stayed across the river from the main town and after a 9 hour bus journay and a 13 hour train journey we were gladly met by the first person who offered us accomodation across the river. We stayed in mud huts for 3 pound a night and they had a restaurant attached that over looked the river with temples in view.

Hampi has got the feeling of Goa, is really laid back and you can easliy lose a day just doing nothing! there is a local resevoir that everyone goes to for swimming and we rented scooters for the day to have a look about. On our
Temple
last day we took a Tuk Tuk tour of some of the temples, which are pretty amazing to say the least (Check the photos below 😊 ) and packed our bags ready for our last stop in India for Christmas . . . we are heading back to Goa 😊

Sometimes best communications happens when you're on separate bikes.
I Still remember that drizzling cold midnight, it was in the end of year 2012, winter probably. I had a shower that late night and then got my bull ready, warmed up the engine, held the helmet in the hand and slowly started riding bullet in a zig-zag way on the empty outer ring road of Bangalore humming an old hindi track,

"" Pukartaa Chala Hun Main
Gali Gali Bahaar Ki
Bas Ek Chaaon Jhulf Ki
Bas ek nigaaah ho pyaaar ki
Pukaartaaa….“

I was on my way to my friends' room to join them for a whole new chapter of ‘Motorcycle Diaries’ on my Royal Bull. The worst thing happened as I reached friend's room, could not wake my friends up from their dead sleep as they hear neither my voice nor my mobile call.

Since they stay at third floor, they should have at least kept the ground floor gate open, which locks anyone in entering inside the apartment, they forgot that as well. So, now I can’t even knock their door on the third floor of the apartment. I lost all my cool and dropped the food I bought for them.

I called
Breakfast Break :)
them again and again, almost a hundred times (exaggerated round-off), I did even throw stones to their window, no use! Can you imagine this scene around 1.30am? I was on my way back to room, and my blood became as hot as engine crank.

Finally, around 4.00 in the morning, My cell phone started ringing! I picked the call, No response from either side.

First a breeze of Silence, then small spark of lightning, and then the thunder explosion...,I exploded like anything over the phone!Finally cooled down after a while, after all what’s friends for all?

May be after an hour or so, I stretched to their room again and we left early in the morning at 4.30 am after knotting bags tightly on the 'bull'. We had to keep engine idling in neutral for a while near outer ring road for Ravi to join. He was a colleague of Niyas & Majeed then. Some moods can only be understood by riders. If racing is sport, riding is art, the machine itself is art, hence the rider must be a ‘poet’ while starring. You can almost forget what you do for a living when your knees are
Into The Wild
in the breeze. On the way we had morning tea near Mandya and then set off again. We had breakfast in the second break.

Afternoon, we reached Coorg!

Green Coorg, Nestled in the western ghats is essentially a place for the nature lover, with a rich eco diversity and ever green trees like teak sandalwood. Their economy is mainly based on agriculture & forestry, coffee is a key contributor there.The people seems to be simple and friendly, we heard that the homestay culture is very well rooted over there, because we had a plan of going to Abbey Falls or Dubare elephant camp, but not sure whether we would be able to make it.We took breaks from riding, sometimes in any coffee estates, sometimes near agriculture fields or under some teak tree forest.

In the evening after a long ride, with lots of twists and turns, reached Madikkeri, a small town and had our tea, then changed the gear to Kabkabe, near our final destination Tadiyandamol. In between we lost our way, and the uncertainty added little more flavor in our ride, and somehow finally reached to Kabkabe.

If I remember correctly, we came like this
Trek it with a Snicker bite :)
: Bangalore > Mandya > Sreerangapattanam > Kushal Nagar > Madikkeri > Kemod > Kabkabhe > Thadiyandamol
Our plan was to setup a hut somewhere on the hills, and we even had the items required. But after chatting with some guys there who were running resorts, it happened to be a discussion of stay deal.They pulled us back with all of their might explaining the presence of Elephants, Forest Guards and the consequences. Finally we dropped the idea of hut in the forest hills .

By the time we knew that’s typical Resort business strategy, it was too late.

Then we went for a shot walk , it was late in the evening . But if you were a person woke up that time, you would not know whether it was early morning or dawn. The noises in that deadly silent area gave us a unique feeling.

By then, I fell in love with this killing beauty, The misty and husky Coorg. At night, after finishing heavy resort meals, We set the alarm ready and slept.

Got up at 5.30 am and set-off at 6.00 in the morning from the resort room, after 10 minute ride
Up in the clouds!
we reached a small plateau above the coffee estates by bike. No more ride possible from there, we locked the vehicles and got the backpack on our shoulder. And yes, drank some sweet forest water from the tiny falls. The trek looked easy first, Views are awesome with many a layers of hill after hill forming waves of ridges somewhere in the distance. The stream above the plateau and a few big boulders offered a good place to rest and fill water for rest of the journey. Trust me you hardly get that kind of sweet, pure and cool water.

I have got a shock in the beginning itself by seeing low battery signal in my Nikon dSLR, forgot to charge it, still I managed to capture with my Canon digital. Two of my close friends were busy in making use of their iPhone at the max with poses and clicks.

The next three kilometers were not all the simple and it took some time and effort. It gets steep and tiring but the views and the surroundings makes the walk a pleasure. Last stretch goes through a ‘real’ forest, another quick steep ascent and we are already
Niyas finds Inner Peace
at the top. It's around 8 Km and takes no more than three hours to make the journey, give or take an hour based on your fitness levels, all the way I was exasperating my friends by telling them to be fast.

And once on top, there is nothing else you would desire in a trek life, you are up in the spongy clouds with the majestic beauty of tremendous landscape around!

Thadiyandamol is the highest peak in Coorg. Its windy peak offers unhindered views of impressive mountain ranges and valleys of Coorg and beyond. Neatly stacked layers of hills align one behind the other, extending to the horizon and gently merging into the blue sky. Sensuous curves of the ridges lead down the peak and further up to the next one and the next, eventually disappearing into the mist somewhere faraway, inviting the beholder to walk along them and lose themselves in the mystery that the depth of the hills seem to convey.

Beholding the tremendous natural beauty of the scapes by all my senses, I praised The Lord of all the worlds.

While coming back, after filling our ""Bull' tanks full, we took a
Inside Namdroling Monastery
turn near Kushal Nagar to Namdroling Monastery; The Golden Temple at Bylakuppe in Coorg District, where Tibetan have the largest settlement in India, who mainly belongs to Sangha community.

If we go back to history few decades back, many monks (led by Dalai Lama ) fled to India in 60’s and continued in subsequent years to escape the wrath of Chinese forces, One of the respected monk Penor Rinchoppe put the platform for the monastery with the aim of helping those relocated monks. Over the years with every ones support it has developed a lot. Late 90’s the establishment of Golden temple became a reality. Here Buddha’s preachings are preserved for worldwide propagation .This monastery is known as a center for pure upholding of the teachings of Buddha, which is a lineage of Tibetan Buddhism in the world.

When I saw the architecture design, it reminded me of some Kun-fu marshal ads movie ‘gurukul’ set. This Tibetan architecture has enough space to host congregation of hundreds of monks. Once you’re inside, bring your attention to three imposing golden statues, Buddha in the middle, Rinchoppe to right and Amitayus to left(all Deities). There were some kind of prayer going
Temple inside the monastery compound
on and they used some instruments to make sounds at each interval , When prayer is in session, the chanting of mantras accompanied by sounds of drums and cymbals etc. resonate the place. Pillars and walls are very much decorated with designs and murals. Some sub-junior 'monks' were playing here and there.

There is one small temple in the front, completed recently which rises vertically with tires of artistic golden turrets and a golden semicircular arch on top. I forgot to tell you, An inevitable part of Buddhist temple are prayer wheel, here you may find hundreds of them, in different sizes, turning the wheel in clockwise direction during prayer considered as an effective way of supplication.

Other than agriculture, they also find time in handicrafts tradition, souvenirs sold thru stores, and of Corse you can get some Tibet style cuisine prepared there in canteen. Besides, this monastery also features a retreat Centre for monks for intensive training with food and stay. We took some clicks and packed back to Bangalore with two bottles of coorg honey, unfortunately later found that the honey was not as pure as they promised while selling.

The journey was a memorable
Golden Statues in Namdroling Monastery
one by all the ways and means, all of us became iron-butt associates due to the continuous ride on the bikes even though we took enough breaks, those who has experienced the burning can only understand it. We had dinner at Empire Restaurant, newly opened then on Mysore road, reached Bangalore around 11.30pm.

(We never know how and when misfortune would hit us,so never be afraid to slow down.)

Mamallapuram high street
Almost without exception the initial exposure elicits a profound feeling of wonderment and awe, mixed with a certain amount of repulsion and bewilderment. That first encounter with any of the possible ports of entry is an assault on the senses: the myriad colours of the disparate mass of milling humanity; the cacophony of sound; the jostling, jousting multitude of vehicles; roaming beasts; heady aromas of incense, cut flowers, spices and sandalwood battling the astringent stench of urine and stagnant effluent; and, unless arriving in a Delhi winter, all bathed in a stifling, oppressive heat. Juxtaposed, like nowhere else on earth, are tarmac and dirt, wealth and poverty, the mouth-watering and the repugnant, the hi-tech and the medieval, suited businessmen and loin clothed or naked sadhus, ladies in stunning sari/choli combinations and filthy rag-wrapped old crones, munificent kindness and indignant rudeness, trendy iphone-sporting youths and desperate broken and twisted beggars, the obese and the starving. India: our first love; the one country – to date – that we can never imagine tiring of. For the western traveller it defines culture-shock. That said, like all gut-churning, head-spinning infatuations the passion – the frissance - is inevitably tempered by familiarity. This, our sixth extended
Taxis outside Chennai airport
visit since 1990, felt more like being reacquainted with a dear but unpredictable old friend, one who you can never quite define – and therein lies the magic of the relationship.

We flew from Colombo to Chennai, lucky to be chasing the tail of the cyclone and having avoided its brunt. Previously one of our least favourite Indian cities, Chennai immediately welcomed: simple rail-links to the city centre, good cheap accommodation and excellent food. Chai stands are once again everywhere (although seemingly always referred to as tea stalls these days) and real masala tea (ginger and cardamom-infused) is well worth the few extra rupees. The amalgam of boiling milk and steeped tea is still – magically - mixed by the elaborate repeated pouring from one elevated, head-high vessel into another at waist height.

Certain changes were immediately evident from our last visit six years ago: where once all women, regardless of age, had long plaited hair, now - in Tamil Nadu at least - many boast short pixie-cuts; whilst the aging man is apparently less likely to think it a good idea to dye his hair/beard a violent shade of orange. It is also much cleaner, street-side bins
Chai vendor, Tiruvannamalai, Tamil Nadu
are common and people use them. Predictably there are far fewer bicycles, almost no peddle rickshaws and many, many more motorbikes (far more common than mopeds) and cars.

However, street-side urination for men (and children) is still common place – some of this is pure laziness as there are far more public toilets now available in cities. Nevertheless, more than a quarter of a billion (250,000,000+) Indians still have no access to any form of a toilet and much common/derelict/in-development/simply semi-private land are the only places available for the purpose. Meanwhile, following rain, black horrors continue to bubble out from beneath the man-hole covers of inadequate sewage systems – those that are actually covered.

Power was constant whilst we were in Chennai, but in the rest of Tamil Nadu it remains erratic to say the least – in Mamallapuram, forty miles from Chennai, you’re lucky if it’s on for six hours a day.

Predictably, like the rest of Asia, mobile phones are everywhere. In fact new 3G phones with their internet access are commonplace which may explain the dearth of public wifi; really it is almost non-existent, being far more common in Laos or Myanmar. Bizarrely, whilst
Maharaja's palace, Mysore
the majority of Indians still speak only a smattering of English, they and just about everyone else in the world – except the Japanese – now answer their mobiles with “hello”.





Anyway, Mamallapuram, a mere couple of hours down the coast from Chennai, was hit hard by the tsunami which took and temporarily gave: long forgotten monuments associated with the shore temple were, momentarily, exposed by the waves only to be steadily reclaimed by sand and sea. Town is no longer scarred and has advanced well beyond any resemblance it had to back in 2004, let alone the 1990s:once mud lanes are now sealed and lined with restaurants, shops and guesthouses.We enquired at half a dozen of the latter, the cheapest of which offered us a room for 400rp ($8). Then a wizened old man appeared - don’t you just love them – and offered a place for 200rp. We went. The Hotel Five Rathas, tucked away in the residential area to the north of town, has several smallish, basic rooms to one side of a very private courtyard garden (beware the coconuts – whilst sitting chatting one crashed
Sultan's tomb, Bidar
into the table missing my head by inches). They’ll happily provide anything you may require, although most extras can be bought at a more reasonable rate independently. That does not include food – which is cheap, excellent (fish curries, tomato masalas and some of the best home-made chapattis you’re ever likely to encounter) and the longer you stay the more you’ll receive. Mother is not nearly as stern as she initially appears. Meanwhile, if you’re lucky, you may experience neighbours (most are long-stayers) like Dian (a talkative one-eared Slovenian author), or John (a 76 year young, Aussie tepee dweller – from Norfolk via Nimbin) who will, if nothing else, provide a different outlook on life. These guys did far more than that.

And then you stroll into town, passing the majestic bas-relief boulders and the stone masons squatting in the dust, and witness a whirling dervish. It isn’t quite the outpost it used to be, but it’s still… some place.





With the exception of certain rare re-visits this trip to India is all about seeing as many previously neglected destinations as possible. Consequently, they’ll be no Kerela, no Hampi, Agra and the Taj, Rajasthan’s
Arunachaleswar temple
more famous cities/forts, hill stations such as Darjeeling and maybe not even mystic Varanasi (oh, the missed photo ops). Fortunately, we’ve hardly touched the far north in prior visits – but these States will have to wait until after Bangladesh, Nepal and the start of spring as they are already snow-bound and we intend to do some serious trekking this time round. Whether we’ll have the patience and resolve to obtain the permits necessary to gain entry to the Eastern Tribal States remains to be seen.

So, after a sojourn in a familiar old haunt we set about meandering through Tamil Nadu. Nearby Auroville was a tempting start due to its bizarre credentials: a new age community of several thousand (70% Western) built on land donated by 124 countries (I’m guessing these countries all bought adjoining plots of land) and on which exists a cross between a kibbutz and a hippy commune. John was heading there, but, in all honesty, I think they’d have little demand for molecular biologists. Instead we headed west to the grand Hindu temples at Tiruvannamalai and Trichy. Both had these in spades, with soaring pyramid-like, rainbow-coloured gopurams covered with intricate figurines providing access to

ever deeper sanctums. Painted sadhu devotees bearing Shiva tridents lurkat every turn (a photo will likely set you back a cup of chai); and rich-sauced curries, accompanied by the longest-grained rice imaginable, await you at dinner. These certainly aren’t must-visit destinations (indeed Trichy is down-right expensive: cheap lodges shooed us away as soon as we approached), but were pleasant enough nevertheless.

Inside Arunachaleswar temple at Tiruvannamalai there was the sad spectacle of a performing elephant. It was surreal to witness an elephant inside a building, but also distressing to see it pacing-time, head swaying back and forth, as the faithful presented it with coins. These the elephant passed to its handler and the donators were then “rewarded” with a tap on their heads from its trunk. I had visions of the great pachyderm deciding enough was enough, hurling the crowd aside and crashing blindly through the maze of pillars. Actually, there have been a large number of deaths recently at the hands of wild elephants drawn close to towns by shrinking water holes, so much so that in certain States the locals have been warned not to walk jungle paths at dawn or after dark.

Maybe after two months in Sri Lanka – where they are also staunch proponents – we are becoming immune to the ubiquitous Indian head waggle. I’m sure we go days without witnessing/receiving it; saying that, Ali reckons that I’m a bigger user than most locals. As I am totally unaware of having adopted it – let alone what I mean by it – I now feel it is unfair to expect the Indian’s usage to convey any set message.

From headshakes to handshakes; and this note really should have featured in the Sri Lanka blog as that is where Ali first experienced it. Rarely, and it was (is here) pretty rare, Ali received/s some weird bastardized handshake where the middle finger mysteriously curls, mid-grasp, to be pressed into her palm. She feels it has some unpleasant sexual connotation (and I’m sure she’s right, although I was also treated to it once; either that or the Masons have started recruiting women) and she has long since mastered the art of quick release accompanied by her sternest, withering, Paddington bear stare.





After a week of buses we finally had the option of a train: Trichy
Bas relief, Mamallapuram, Tamil Nadu
to Mysore in Karnataka. These days the ticket classes have been re-jigged. Seven years ago there were first class sleepers and first class chairs (luxurious, possibly even with AC – we were never to take one), second class sleepers with two or three tiers of bunks; second class seats and finally (and most certainly a last resort) wooden-benched third class seats. All grades could be reserved in advance with the exception of third class and some second class seats. Our target, for a journey of any real length, was always the two upper, facing bunks in three-tier second class. During the day the middle tier is dropped so that all passengers can sit on the bottom bunk. The top bunk always remains in place, giving the occupier the choice of lying down at any point during the journey – it is also closest (indeed beware if you have long hair) to the ceiling fans. Today there are air-conditioned compartments comprising just two bunks (1AC), four bunks in two tiers (2AC) or six bunks in three (3AC). Non-A.C. is limited to an open carriage of sleeper class and the new lowest grade, second class seats; apparently there is nolonger a third
Diwali, Trichy
class.

Certain major railway stations have tourist reservation offices (I’m presuming they still exist), negating the need to jostle with the masses; Trichy doesn’t. We queued (really, this does seem to be catching on) at the reservations window and were eventually informed that the train we sought was fully booked. Did we want to join the 362 people on the waiting list? This didn’t sound too promising. As we stood pondering our next move a kindly gentleman, overhearing our plight, suggested the “emergency quota”. But, I reasoned, we don’t have a valid emergency. “You’re a tourist” he smiled. So, we bought a waiting list ticket and, sure enough, on finding the appropriate office and filling the appropriate form, sleepers miraculously became available: a little shard of paper was tucked into one of a huge stack of ledgers and a beaming head shimmy confirmed that we were sorted. It isn’t fair, but the “tourist quota” of tickets on certain trains still exists, just semi-hidden behind the “emergency quota” façade (at least local people can use this in an… emergency).

As the train rumbled into the station (clean; non-smoking ;
Looking towards Om beach, Gokarn
with minimal homeless curled up for the night; far less red-jacketed coolies than normal in evidence; and – tragically – chai no longer served in handmade, unglazed disposable clay mugs) we waited by a post flashing a digital “S3” (supposedly our carriage). Indeed the sleeper carriage number three ground to a halt in front of us. The Shinkansen-esque precision parking was in no way reflected in the train: a dirty, noisy diesel engine hauling rickety wooden carriages with barred opening windows. Thankfully, as per forever, pasted to the side of the carriage was a list of all passengers and their berths - including us. As if we ever doubted Indian paperwork.

The journey, sadly only twelve hours, followed typical Indian railway standards: got chatting to friendly engaging locals (Ali obviously got to hold a baby); attempted – in-vain – to refuse proffered contents of tiffin tins; dashed off at stops/pauses for additional snacks, chai and crafty cigarettes; slept soundly and arrived early (ok, so the latter was unusual).

We didn’t really plan on staying in Mysore, but being Diwali (festival of light) there was only a skeleton staff working at the station and that didn’t include “emergency
Muslim girl, Bidar
quota” personnel (onward trains were all fully booked). Serendipity because Mysore is charming: leafy, tree-lined thoroughfares;roundabouts and squares with impressive monuments and arches; friendly, helpful people; a stunning – particularly when illuminated by its 100,000+ light bulbs (Sundays and public holidays only) – Maharaja’s palace; the Devaraja market, a narrow perfumed maze selling mountains of flower heads (for garlands), precarious conical piles of kumkum (coloured powder used for bindi dots) and benches overflowing with bottles of essential oils; plus it has a rather good roof-terraced restaurant.

On arrival we had stalked the streets seeking a reasonably priced room. Help came in the delightfully unexpected form of a young rickshaw driver: no lift required, no commission extorted, just simple directions provided. We bumped into him several times over the next few days, always declining his offers of cheap prices to the sights (it’s actually a good hearty walk to Chamundi hill for its panoramic views over the city). However, on hearing how we could earn him in excess of 400 rps commission and a new jacket (standard rickshaw issue) at no cost to ourselves we felt compelled to return the favour. And so with the aid of our smartest clothes,
Sunset at Om, Karnataka
his cousin’s taxi (for impressive arrivals) and convincing touristic buying-heads on, we toured the swanky silk/carpet/artifact emporia. We took pictures of the pashmina that our mothers would select between, weighed up the bronze statues, drank some wonderful gratis teas, promised returns and bought diddly-squat. He and his cousin must have done well as they later treated us to further teas.





From Mysore to Mangalore; just an overnight stop, but worth it if only for the souvalaki-style chicken shwarmis and then on to the fabled Gokarn(a) and Om beach. Somehow Om missed our radar twenty-odd years ago. We learned of it through Steve Carey and his ballad “Chai Chillum Chapatti” (recited live to The Usual Suspects most – inspired - nights at Felix’s in Benaulum, Goa) in the late 1990s, but still we hadn’t partaken.

The dusty town of Gokarn is not without its visitors, western and local alike (it has several important, mainly Shiva, temples). It does have tourist flotsam, but is still an independently functioning town and definitely retains soul. And then you walk the forty minutes to Om (the lazy can now rickshaw almost the entire way) and
Gopuram detail, Trichy
are transported back to that fleeting period when India’s beaches hit their tourist zenith: dispersed and discrete enclaves of beach huts that are almost invisible from the lustrous bays and yet serve all possible – backpacker - needs. Yes, you can advance further along the wooded coastline to the very rustic Half Moon beach (15 mins) or yet further to Paradise (another 20 mins) where it is still primarily camping and self-reliance; but really, Om is paradise: Sangam’s is on our short list for best guesthouse in Asia. In the words of Steve’s song: “Dolphins in the magic sea, coconuts among the trees, smiling faces, life is free – internationally; half past six time slips away, as day and night revolve we play, watch the sun set from the rocks….Chillum”. We dragged ourselves away after fifteen days; it could have been fifteen weeks. We missed it instantly.

Obviously, two weeks spent throwing a Frisbee, browning to a crisp, chilling, following the first two Test matches, devouring books and anything from Sangam’s excellent kitchen, supping ginger-lemon tea, cold beers and the odd old monk rum doesn’t make for lengthy prose – hurrah, I hear you say
Garland vendor
– but, and here I really am loath to promote: go before it changes. There is (surely) no finer beach scene in India. Big thanks to the mystic Israeli, the Bangalore crowd, Mr. Bhang and particularly the wonderful staff of Sangam’s.





Wow, and that brings up a year. How time flies…

We advanced up the coast to Christian Goa where saris are largely replaced by printed dresses and alcohol is at its cheapest and most accessible. Rurally, haystacks resemble giant muffins, pigs roam freely and the cow is no longer revered, indeed it may also end up in a tangy, vinegary vindaloo. We stayed in Palolem, at a quaint, quiet, family-run place set back from the – now ruined – over-developed beach. This was a great spot twelve years ago and, to be fair, still isn’t a bad place for a holiday: the sea food is good, but… it isn’t what it once was. Moved onto Panaji, supposedly one of India’s most picturesque State Capitals and it really does have a lost in time feel, very much like Malaysia’s Melaka or Georgetown with old colonial relics and dreamy winding backstreets. Nevertheless, the
Inside Bidar fort
only budget option found us in a grim hole with me sleeping on a rattan mat on the floor. Aging bones forced us to upgrade for the second night to a pleasant enough room, but with the spitefully mean (not yet Tracy) check-out time of 8.30 a.m.

Margao has replaced Vasco De Gama as the train hub of Goa and has modernized rapidly. It also epitomizes the problems, reported in the press, that Goa is having with alcohol. Our hotel – there are no guesthouses to speak of, only local flop-houses that patently would not have been either secure or safe – located near the train station was surrounded by wine shops and grotty bars (many so grim that even we would not consider patronage) and by mid-afternoon the streets were littered with prone drunks. It’s heart-rending enough to be surrounded by poverty, but even worse when a sizable proportion is obviously linked to alcohol abuse.

Nevertheless, we did take advantage of Goa’s cheap alcohol and purchased 6 small bottles of Old Monk which we know will prove invaluable for upcoming dry States such as Gujarat. What we didn’t realize is that transporting alcohol out of
South gate of Sri Ranganthaswarmy temple, Trichy, TN.
Goa requires a license and that regular checks are made at the borders with other States. Failure to produce a license (easily obtained from the bottle shop if you are aware of the necessity) can result in fines and/or confiscation. We packed the contraband wisely and ran the risk – successfully.

Leaving the beaten track we headed north east to the fort town of Bidar. This is not an easily accessed destination (trains via Hyderabad, the simplest route, were fully booked for days and there is no emergency quota) and saw us take a train to Hubli (5 hrs), another to Bijapur (6 hrs) where we stayed overnight, then buses to Gulbara (4 hrs), Sirdoan (30 mins) - walk over the bridge here as it too weak to take heavy vehicles, and finally another to Bidar (3 hrs). This region of Karnataka is very agricultural and we passed golden fields of thirsty sunflowers with heavy bowed heads, green fields of squat chenna (not sure if these are soya beans or chickpeas or something more exotic) and great expanses of sugar cane, much of it in the process of being harvested and hauled off in oxen-drawn carts or towering lorries.
Watching the sunset from the rocks... Om
Meanwhile, Goa’s muffin haystacks have morphed into concave teepees.

Contrary to what we were expecting, getting away from the tourist trail (we haven’t seen a white face in a week) has not seen a decrease in accommodation prices, in fact quite the opposite. No habitable rooms exist in Bijapur for less than 500 rp and Bidar is only marginally cheaper. The room we took in Bijapur was tiny with peeling walls and the odd cockroach (no problems with that at all), but a filthy encrusted toilet and dirty sheets at $10/night is peevishly shoddy indeed. Remove the bloody television – saving on electricity – and pay someone to actually clean the room.

Thankfully, Bidar proved to be worthy of the effort: a bustling town with friendly inquisitive locals including a sizable Muslim population, mosques outnumbering Hindu temples; atmospheric, crumbling sultan’s tombs (packed with burka-clad visitors – we were attractions in our own right); and the wonderful ruins of Bidar’s 15th century fort spread out over undulating hills with its winding, triple-gated entrance, 5.5km of encircling battlements inside three moats hewn from solid red rock.

Rasganga pure veg restaurant deserves a special mention for its delicious
Garland vendor, Mysore
and dirt cheap special thalis.

Western tourists are obviously a rarity in Bidar and the usual questions of “What country?”, “What’s your name?” and “How many children?” were typically replaced with – in the nicest possible way - “Why you come here?”.





Anyway, from here we will head to Nagpur where we hope (subject to ticket availability) to attend several days of the last Test match – we’ll be wearing the Burmese hats (keep your eyes peeled for us on the television).

Oh, five weeks into India and (I am touching wood at this point) not a single stomach bug – how times have changed.





And finally….

Yes, I can’t resist a quick mini resume of the last twelve months: Hong Kong, China (very superficially – back there next year), Laos, Cambodia, Thailand (just passing through), Malaysia, Indonesia (seven islands), Myanmar, Sri Lanka and India (on-going).

It has to be said that this doesn’t seem like a lot of countries for a year and, for that matter, it is only four new countries for us. Still, it has been a fantastic year and one we’re very
Tomb, Bidar
grateful for.

Highlights:

a) People: ha, now that I have a list of countries in front of me I see that few wouldn’t merit special mention; however, for us the Cambodian’s, Sumatrans, Myanmar and Sri Lankans were very, very special indeed. Hell, the Laos were delightful; whilst the Chinese are far friendlier now than we remembered them. On a negative note, many touristic areas of Bali and Lombok in Indonesia should be ashamed of themselves; whilst the Thai’s seem plain jaded.





b) Sights: China (and so much more to see); certain Indonesian islands (Sumatra: almost everything we were privileged to experience, Lombok’s Mt. Rinjaniand Suluweisi, not to mention the sunsets, orangs, dragons and snorkeling); and Myanmar’s Bagan.





c) Food: Every country has provided something exceptional (save Hong Kong where we know they have it, but price prohibited enjoying it – they do have great Maccy Ds though). Laos for banana flower and rattan salads and Tai Dam food (Papaya restaurant was magnificent); Cambodia for their special – and at no extra cost – pizzas; Melakain Malaysia for sublime noodles; goes without saying anything cooked by Mark;
Bombay Badam milk, Tiruvannamalai
Indonesia for the gorengan and Warung Bambu’s pelecing kangkung and bakso; Myanmar for its Shan and Mon cuisines; Sri Lanka’s veggie curries – yes, I am thinking of Mrs.Bawa’s; and India is just simply food heaven.





d) Alcohol: It has to be said that China can out budget anyone in South East Asia in terms of beer (lager), although both Laos and Cambodia (and Malaysia’s duty-free LangKawi) have notably cheap brews; Indonesia and Sri Lanka for their variations on palm and rice wines – the latter in particular for the ambiance of the drinking experience.





e) All round backpacker price-friendliness: current thinking would beLaos but we’re still saying India, although it is no way as clear cut as it once was. The big surprises were that Myanmar and Sri Lanka really can be experienced on a small budget (both cheaper than Laos for us, plus Laos didn’t have to absorb any flights). Indeed South East Asia is still backpacker heaven pricewise (just don’t rely on Lonely-sell-out-Planet for any bargains) - even with 16 flight tickets and 16 visas we are still averaging a fraction under $40/day ($39.96 as

I type) between us and we weren’t expecting that.

Vinceya at the Speakers
December has shown its face, and my Travel Blog countdown is nearly to the single digits.

I will likely put up a couple more blogs before my India Adventure concludes (We still have a Christmas celebration to document!), but I wanted to take a moment to reflect on my time here, and on what December brings for me and the students.

I know that I've mainly written positive things for my blog entries, and I know that many of you are probably asking, ""Is it really that great over there?"" And the answer is that I guess I've been a little dishonest in my writing. It hasn't all be great. There are days (especially recently) when I want to run to my room screaming, ""BUT I'M NOT EVEN PAID FOR THIS JOB!"" I am often confronted with ""surprises,"" like a fundraising concert where the choir had to brush-up/learn seven songs in eleven days (more on the concert in a moment), or when the 12th graders are suddenly thrown into a block schedule of studying and testing that not only conflicts with half of my time with the 11th graders, but makes it so I am working virtually the whole

school day (and before and after for prep, choir, voice lessons, and PT). I don't do well with scheduling surprises. I need 24 hours to process, and that has often not been given to me (or my supervisor, for that matter).

But, here's the thing: Even after a truly dreadful day, like this past Monday, where the 12th graders are sleepy and I'm so stressed I can't make decisions, something beautiful happens. On Monday, this came in the form of Creative Writing with the 8th graders. I was just given this class the week previous, to fill a gap created by a departed volunteer. I was not looking forward to ending my Monday with them, as my first class with them the previous week had been hellish: I had been so excited to talk about archetypes with them by sharing one of my favorite concept albums (Light Chasers by Cloud Cult...so beautiful) and having them write a story inspired by the archeypal events the music follows, but they did not understand and continued interrupting me before I could explain. And then, when I came to pick up the first part of their stories on Friday, not a single one
Supria
of them had done the homework because they were ""too busy studying for exams."" When they told me this, I had to walk out of the room before I said something I'd regret. Instead, I vented to Lizzy, and I know she and several other staff members reprimanded them, so I was also wary of how the 8th graders would react to the project (the album was only about half-completed) now that they'd gotten in trouble over it. But when I came in this Monday, the students were apologetic and then, after we listened to a few more songs, legitimately involved in the project. Of course, I also made some adjustments to clarify things, but they met me halfway, and by the end some were singing along. Some stayed after class to listen to the final song. Where I (and perhaps they) had least expected it, we ended up having a wonderful time.

I think this is one of the reasons I like teaching. You can take it on a day-to-day basis and, although something may go horribly, you are forced to either face the issue or determine it is negligable the next day and move forward. Either way,
Waiting
This picture reveals so much about my students. Sujatha, the one behind her hands, is a mischievous 11th Grader. Nickhil, in the red, is always very chill. Shrimathi, smiling, loves attention. And Vijay, in the stripes, often looks a little tired (especially in class) :-D
I have learned that humans of any age have ample capacities for forgiveness. If only it could be exercised more outside of the classroom.

In any case, this past week has also felt insane because we have been preparing for a fundraising concert. A group of 34 choir members has been rehearsing with me an hour every night, losing some of their precious studying time for exams (starting December 3). I am so proud of the work they have done, but rehearsals haven't been without their struggles. The performance space doesn't have any piano, so we had to record the accompanist, and I don't think the students understand just how much their accompanists have been adjusting to their fluctuating speeds--I cannot tell you how many complaints I've received about the speed of the recordings. They also are not used to actively watching a conductor, which is more necessary than ever now that we don't have live accompaniment. But, except for ""Memories,"" which the students found either too fast or too slow, depending on who was talking, we brought everything together nicely for the performance.

We all packed onto a bus and rode for 1.5 hours to Rainbow Drive,
The Choir
a gated community outside of Bangalore. Apparently, SB students don't travel very much, and are prone to terrible motion sickness. In light of this, each student was given a ""vomit cover"" (cover being the word used for bag) and some chewing gum. I was lucky to be sitting with some folks who were decidedly not carsick. Lizzy brough her speakers and ipod, so we listened to music and danced and played a (slightly unfair) game of ""Never Have I Ever."" When we arrived, we set up and then were given delicious food. We didn't have enough time to rehearse anything on the stage, which was unfortunate, and the audience didn't really finish arriving until 30 minutes after we were supposed to start, which was also unfortunate. The kids were antsy, as we had already seated them in front of the audience, and so they were put under scrutiny for an extended period of time.

When the concert finally did begin, we had several problems with sound, and at first I could not hear the music from my conducting spot. I changed location, which improved my hearing significantly, and although the choir was clearly nervous and unused to singing in large echoey spaces, they were extremely attentive, and we managed to pull through. After the concert, we were given cake and juice boxes, which are very special treats for the kids.

And now, here I am, sitting in a hotel room in Bangalore on Sunday morning, taking what I've deemed a ""Me-Weekend."" I only have twelve more days left in India, so this will likely be my last chance to explore outside of SB. It's strange, to roam a city alone after spending most of your days at a secluded school. When I return to SB, it will be time for exams and more choir rehearsals for the ""German Party"" next weekend--another event in Bangalore that SB students go to each year because the attendees are some of our biggest sponsors. But for now, I'm just going to relax, meet a friend of a friend for lunch, and take some time to reflect.

Lakshmi the Elephant
Rubba dub-dub.
I made a promise in my last entry that I would dedicate this entry to ruins and the movie Up, and I have no intention of disappointing (I know you all must be sitting at the edge of your seats, dying to hear about both). First, some ruins, and then I'll move on to this Upbusiness when I get to that part of the story.

Our ruins exploration took several different forms over a couple of days: One day, we walked to one end of the Bazaar and wandered around, and the next we went to the other end of the Bazaar, where the Virupaksha Temple is, and Peter and I took a bike tour from there (Ally doesn't bike so well, so Bitsy agreed to walk around with her instead of touring with us).

(Before I get too far, I want to give a little disclaimer: I was inundated with a lot of interesting information over this week, but I wouldn't be surprised if I wrote something down incorrectly. If, by any means, I misspeak about a tradition or concept, I would like to apologize in advance, and invite you to bring light to the mistake. the last

thing I want to do is provide everyone with a ton of misinformation.)

A little bit of background regarding the ruins, and why they are where they are, surrounding the little town of Hampi: The ruins are from the 7th c.-16 c., and display the growth of an empire that at one time covered half of India. Hampi was the hub of this empire, and the Hampi Bazaar was once filled with vendors selling precious jewels. Hampi's golden age was from around 1520-1560, but ended when it was invaded and subsequently occupied for a grand total of 6 months. After that time, the invaders moved on, but took Hampi's wealth and any chance of rebuilding the empire with them.

When you walk to the end opposite the Virupaksha Temple, you are greeted by this fantastic monolithic bull. In Hinduism, bull-statues are called nandi, and they are a symbol of Shiva. The monolithic bull is impressive, but can no longer be considered holy because it is broken. Hampi is actually home to a one-of-a-kind nandi (a very small one, but memorable all the same) with three heads, which is believed to symbolize the unity of the three main gods:
Monolithic Bull (aka Nandi)
Brahma, the Generator; Vishnu, the Operator; and Shiva, the Destroyer. Get it? Generator Operator Destroyer. GOD. My tour guide's, Hanuman's (yes, just like the monkey-god), face lit up when he told us that trick to remember the key Hindu gods.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Back to our un-guided ruin-wandering.

After you passed the monolithic nandi, you descended into a large temple, complete with deteriorating columns and doorways. Bitsy and I sat and admired the architecture for quite some time, enjoying the quiet, the rest (this was the same day as the Hanuman Temple climb), and the shade.

And then, all of a sudden, I heard it.

At first, I didn't believe my ears, but then it happened again, and I told Bitsy, and she listened for it too. It happened a third time, and there was no denying it.

We found Kevin.

Okay, so that was enough drama for a not-so-dramatic moment, but I will be perfectly honest that this made my day. For those of you who are not familiar with the movie Up, or for those who need a refresher, Kevin is the large fictional bird (called a ""snipe"") that
Holy Water Tank
resembles an oversized, colorful dodo. She has a very distinct call--one that cannot be mistaken--and we definitely heard her many times somewhere in the rocky distance. I did some research, and found out that she was designed to resemble the male himilayan monal pheasant, but when I listened to the call of said pheasant, I was disappointed to find it completely different from Kevin's. So, in short, I have no idea what type of bird I heard, but I like to imagine there is a giant chocolate-loving snipe roaming among the boulders of Hampi.

And while I'm on the subject of boulders: One of the things that baffled me when I first started walking around Hampi is that there are many boulders with a thin line of square holes across its face. It turns out that this is evidence of harvested rock. Quarriers would make little nodules in which they would squeeze squares of wood. When the wood got wet, it would expand, and break the rock.

The following day, when we went into Virupaksha Temple (before the bike tour), we were told to go to the river to see Lakshmi the Elephant get her bath. She later

blessed Peter and Ally (put her trunk over their heads). Peter was then approached by a couple of tour guides, both with whom he had agreed to go on tours. They were from the same company, but what Peter didn't realize was that they worked independently during the same hours, so they decided to ask him to choose which one he wanted to be our guide. He chose Hanuman (to whom he had spoken earlier than the other), and we certainly were not disappointed.

Hanuman took us to a bike rental place and outfitted us with some really nice 1-speed bikes (no, really, they were well-kept). He led us to about eight or so stops, mostly temples of various sorts. We learned that Virupaksha Temple was considered a very holy place because Vishnu's symbol, the lingam (which is a cylindrical, basically unmarked slab of rock), was naturally found there without human alteration. We visited a couple of Ganesha temples with broken monoliths (""Peanut Ganesha,"" named after the shape of the dent in his belly; and ""Mustard Ganesha,"" named so because the man who built it made all of his money as a mustard seed vendor). Across from Mustard Ganesha

Somewhere in the direction of Kevin.
was another large bazaar, with what looks like a beautiful pool. Turns out that it was actually a tank used for holy water, and was blessed at least once a year by a procession walking around it clockwise (you always do this at Hindu temples).

We also visited the Hazara Rama Temple which, if I remember correctly, is supposed to be on the site of Rama and Sita's wedding. In any case, the temple is covered with a series of pictograms that tell the Ramanyana, and after Hanuman (the guide) was finished giving us a brief description and showed us the very beginning of the story, Peter found the pictograph of Hanuman (the god) showing Rama's ring to Sita (see part 2 if you have no idea what I'm talking about). That made us feel like quite the accomplished students.

So, that's all for ruins and Kevin...but WAIT! There's more action-packed adventure to come! Filled with bicycle accidents and train-chases and McDonalds!

But, for now, much love from India!

Yoga Paradise
Okay, friends. Now for the second installment of my holiday adventures (or, should I say, ""Now to our featured presentation!""):

The second morning at Hampi, we decided to go to the Hanuman Temple on Anjaneya Hill. This temple is still-functioning, and is one of about four places that claims to be the birthplace of Hanuman, a very important monkey god.

Some background on Hanuman: He plays a huge role in the Ramanyana, the epic tale of Rama's (one of Vishnu's incarnations) battles against the 10-headed demon king of Sri Lanka. The tale begins with the demon king's abduction of Sita (Rama's wife). Hanuman becomes one of Rama's followers and, when Rama is unable to cross a large body of water to get to Sri Lanka, Hanuman leaps (or ""flies like Superman"" according to a tour guide) across with Rama's ring to show Sita that he is a friend. Of course, there is a lot more to tell, but that gives you an idea of Hanuman's devotion.

To get to the temple, we had to take a rickshaw to the river, then cross the river by boat because there is no functioning bridge in the area. The boat was

small and cramped with motor-bikes, but it was a short ride and the morning air was lovely. We then had to take another rickshaw by lush fields and through small towns to the base of Anjaneya Hill.

So, the temple is up about 570 steps, and even in the morning sun, it was a difficult climb. But once we reached the top, we were welcomed by a beautiful view, prayer-chanting in a small shrine, and monkeys. For a long time, we kneeled in the dark shrine and listened to the chanters, who were doing a call-and-response. Then I went back out to enjoy the scenery, while the others stayed inside.

When they came out, they each had bindis on their foreheads, and they directed me to another small room where I could be blessed by Hanuman. As soon as I entered the shrine, I wished I had seen someone else perform the blessing ceremony first. There were several local women and a boy kneeling in the room, and a small table spread with various dishes and items, and I had no idea where to start. The women looked at me expectantly for a moment, then, realizing my panic,
The View
made a gesture to the boy. He took a small spoon and put holy water into my cupped hands, which the women then gestured for me to drink. I tried, but it basically just touched my lips because I hesitated too long and the water was already falling from between my fingers. Then the boy gave me a handful of sugar, and I was told to eat that, which I did readily. After that, there was a long awkward pause, in which I figured I was supposed to put the bindi on my forehead, but I could not figure out in the dim light which bowl held the powder. The boy seemed hesitant, too (maybe he was not allowed to help me with that part?), and eventually one of the women stood and put the bindi on my forehead. I thanked her and the others as best I could, but I have to admit that I came out feeling like a fool. Hopefully Hanuman understands that I had the best intentions.

When I reemerged, I noticed Peter disappearing over a big boulder behind the shrine. When I looked closer, I realized that there were man-made steps at the base,
The Lonely Tree
and so I decided to do some climbing, too. It turns out that there is a path laid out to a small man-made pond and a single tree among the rocks, straight from your favorite kung-fu movie. The view from was amazing, and the openness at the very top of the hill made you want to stay up there forever.

I'm going to save my ruins exploits from this day and the next for my next entry, but I also wanted to point out that we discovered another fabulous restuarant in Hampi called the Bamboo Tree. It is a roof-top place, with low tables and cushions and pretty darn good naan. It would be a great place to sit back and read a book, though I never got the opportunity to do so.

Next on the docket: Ruins, temples, and how I found a little bit of ""Up"" in India.

Holiday Travels
On Saturday night, we took an overnight bus from Bangalore to Hospet, which is next to Hampi. On Wednesday we took an overnight train to Hyderabad. On Friday we took another overnight train back to Bangalore.


Fancy Meal in Bangalore
Red snapper and rice pilaf.
Well, this week has certainly been quite the adventure. There is quite a bit that I'd love to tell you all, but I'm getting the feeling that it may take a while for me to sprinkle all of my impressions into my various entries. I certainly can't put it all in one, because it would look a bit like a novella in length. So, I've decided to break certain ideas/observations into specific topic-entries. But I thought it'd be nice to give a general overview of my travels here and in a few subsequent entries.

Our adventures began in Bangalore, with a fine mediterranean meal on the roof of a nice, clean mall. It was the most lavish meal I've had in India to date, but I am finding more and more that I don't really crave fancy food here. I'm far more interested in trying the local dishes. In any case, we arrived at the bus station full and happy.

Allow me to give some background: ""We"" refers to the five intrepid travellers who set off for Hampi. There was my roommate, Ally, my On-Site Administrator, Lizzy, and two other coworkers, Bitsy and Peter. Lizzy left our group on
Bus to Hampi
We look more comfortable than we are.
Monday night, and Bitsy went back on Wednesday night, leaving Ally, Peter, and me to the mercy of Hyderabad (more on that later :-) ). The intended itinerary was to arrive at Hampi on Sunday morning, and to leave for Hyderabad on Wednesday night (arriving Thursday morning). Hampi (pronounced ""Hum-pee""--the kids told us to think of humming while peeing) is known for its ruins and rocky vistas. Hyderabad is a large city known for its pearls, but also with some recommended museums/areas.

In any case, the night bus to Hampi was dreadful. When it comes to public transportation, I am pretty relaxed, but this bus made me realize just how uncomfortable transportation can be. All night buses without beds are pretty bad, but remember how I said that honking was the only mode of vehicle communication in India? Well, that doesn't change when the sun goes down. Even in the country, you'd just start to nod off and the bus horn would stab you through one ear and out the other. And I was lucky enough to be next to a vertical pole, so when I jerked my head up in surprise, I'd wham it against the pole. The

frequent sudden braking caused similar discomfort.

And then there was the bathroom incident. The bus stopped about four times total for an 8-hour drive, and the first one was nearly 1/2 an hour long. Bitsy, Lizzy, and I thought that the second stop would be about as long, so we got off to use the toilet. It was my first pit toilet experience, but I got through it well, and came out of the bathroom very proud of myself. Bitsy was there waiting for me, and we walked out together. But when we got out, the bus was already moving. Lizzy was nowhere in sight, but we ran and one of the bus drivers was out there calling to us. Luckily, Lizzy got on the bus before us to point out that we were still in the bathroom. We laughed it off, but I can't help but be grateful that we were not left at a toilet in the middle of nowhere at night. That would be a whole different adventure entirely!

Needless to say, we arrived at the Hospet station (30 minutes from Hampi) intact, and after evading some very pushy rickshaw drivers, managed to catch the

first bus into Hampi. I made the mistake of letting my guard down at this point--I imagined that we would get off the bus, get breakfast, and stroll around to find a nice hotel. But, as soon as we pulled into the Hampi Bazaar, a mob of business owners surrounded us, pushing maps and business cards into our hands (and taking them back away when we did not agree to follow them). They followed us for about fifteen minutes, bombarding us with recommendations every time we stopped to discuss a possible plan of action. Eventually, they began to trickle away, but two or three stuck around for much longer, most notably the owner of the Gopi Hotel and Restaurant (which looked like a good enough establishment, but in which I swore I would never step foot because of the owner's overbearing pushiness). There were guest houses everywhere in the little city proper and it was the off-season, so we had our pick. The problem was, the hotel that we arbitrarily picked from the guidebook in the frenzy of being followed turned out to be recently demolished. Tired, unbathed, and hungry, we finally allowed ourselves to be guided to the Moon

Light Restaurant to regroup.

I have come to understand that it doesn't matter where in the world a small town is; the small-town web of connections exists in Hampi as much as it does in Morris. The restaurant owner picked up on our dilemma pretty quickly, and kindly recommended his cousin's guest house. His daughter even made some calls to make sure there were two rooms available. Grateful for the guidance, we checked it out (Manju Guest House--I highly recommend it), and were pleased to find it clean and spacious.

And so--though the prologue to our trip was rather stressful--began the amazing visit to Hampi.

By the time we were all settled in our hotel, it was only about 10 a.m., so we had a whole day to look forward to. We started wandering the streets and looking in the little shops. The streets in the town proper are small, with colorful buildings and wash hanging on the lines. There is no doubt that Hampi is a tourist town, as there was a travel agent, cyber cafe, bike rental, and guest house on every block. But, as it was the off-season, it was not too crowded (even
Ganesha
The Ganesha statue that was eventually immersed into the river
with the dozens of cows roaming the narrow roads), and although the shop owners were very vocal in asking us to look at their wares, we were no longer harassed or followed. The typical Hampi response to ""No, thank you,"" was a smile and, ""Maybe tomorrow"" as if there would be enough tomorrows to satisfy every request.

I stumbled upon my favorite little shop toward the end of the afternoon. It was basically unmarked, but had walls coverred with figurines and postcards and secondhand books. I found a pile of ""singing bowls"" on a bottom shelf, and asked the store owner about the purpose of the different tones. Before I knew it, I was sitting on the floor with the shopkeeper, trying to play various sizes and shapes of bowl. When water is put into an unblemished hand-made bowl, it will begin to sparkle and leap when the bowl is played. The shop keeper was very good at it, and patient when I had trouble figuring out how to hold the bowl and stick. Eventually, Peter joined in, and we were all playing an atonal symphony. Absolutely beautiful!

That evening, we determined that we wanted to go to
Palak Paneer at Mango Tree
Meals served Mango Tree-style, on a banana leaf.
Mango Tree, which came highly recommended by everybody we talked to. We had some trouble finding it, though, and ended up on the Hampi Bazaar. Good thing, too, because nobody would have been at the restaurant. Turns out that it was the fifth day of celebrating Ganesha's birthday, and we were in for a treat.

Some background on Ganesha: He is the elephant-headed god of good fortune, and the son of Parvati, wife of Shiva. While Shiva was out, Parvati bore a baby god to protect her while she bathed. The new god did, but was thought an intruder and beheaded by Shiva upon Shiva's return. Parvati was distraught and insisted that Shiva find a new head for her child, and he brought back an elephant's head. In remembrance of this story, stautes of Ganesha are immersed in local bodies of water on an ordained day (which varies depending on who you're talking to).

So, we stumbled upon the Immersion procession on Hampi Bazaar, and were almost immmediately greeted by a crowd of locals and a sprinkling of foreign visitors like us. The Ganesha statue was in a trailer on the back of a tractor (again, some small town things are strikingly familiar), and people were passing by, giving their respects to the deity. Soon, there was drumming, and dancing, and kids started running around to slap red or yellow chalk on people's faces. At first, I was wary of joining in the dancing, because it seemed to be mostly local men and children, but then male tourists and eventually female tourists joined in, and by sunset, the procession was underway. A small local girl asked me to put her on my shoulders, and we had a blast bopping around. Ally was carrying the girl's friend, so they would grab hands and dance together on our shoulders.

The procession took a total of about 1 1/2 hours to get to the riverside (1-2 kms.), because we'd take a few steps, and then the drums would start up again and people would get swept up in the dancing again. Eventually, the road became a rocky path and Ganesha had to be carried by several men. As we moved down to the river, the drumming stopped and the chanting began. We walked by haunting ruins in the rock-face, and through a small cavern to the bank of the river. Once there, we sat and watched by flashlight as Ganesha was immersed in the water. Beautiful.

We capped off the night with the long-awaited visit to the Mango Tree, which served us delicious food on banana leaves. It was a perfect ending to an eventful, wonderful day.

Stay tuned for more on ruins, monkeys, and trains, coming soon to a computer near you!

Love,

Lynn

Bangalore building
Bangalore has a slight traffic problem. The city has turned into an Indian powerhouse, and is the hub of the IT and telcoms explosion that is driving unprecedented growth in southern India. However, I'm sure the founding fathers never imagined their native town would become a major city on the subcontinent. As such, the streets of Bangalore weren't designed on a grid, and the city centre is a mishmash of one way streets that wend their way around town like a sinuous snake. The traffic is the worst I've experienced in India, and the inevitable result of the chaos makes for some prodigious traffic jams. So what does an Indian do when their car or bike has their progress impeded, yes you guessed it, it's time to lean on the horn. Bangalore is a cacophony of noise and traffic, but the centre of the city based around Cubbin park is pleasantly clean and modern.

Let's perform a quick reboot, constant reader, to bring you up to speed. We left off in Goa, with your humble correspondent feeling sick as a dog in a Goa resort town. It's not an ideal situation, to be sure, but it is the situation nevertheless.
Lalbagh botanical gardens
I farewelled the staff and travellers from the guest house, and jumped a taxi for the hour long drive back to Dabolim airport. From there I hopped on a Go Air jet for the one hour flight to Bangalore, and then jumped a further taxi for the long drive into town. I booked into the recommended Sumanjay homestay in the heart of the city, and had a few days to explore this excellent city. There's a long term guest from Switzerland staying at the homestay, and the friendly Indian owners made me feel very welcome. I'm still feeling quite fragile, but am well enough to get out and about to explore the sights.

It's amazing how illness dents one's confidence, and my first morning in Bangalore I was nervous as a racehorse before heading out. However, it's simply a matter of getting back on the bike, and as soon as I left the guesthouse to negotiate with auto (tuk tuk) drivers it all started to come together. I spent the first day exploring Cubbin park, and the famous monuments in the vicinity. It's likely you will become hopelessly lost in this city of one way streets, but once I
Central Bangalore
gave in to the situation and just asked the locals for directions at crucial intersections I was able to find my way eventually. The parliament and high court buildings are impressive, and Cubbin park itself is great for walking around.

There's one daily ritual I seem to go through on the subcontinent, where I say something slowly and clearly to an English speaker. They reply with something weird, sometimes not even related to the topic as far as I can discern. I look confused, then repeat myself and get the answer I was seeking first time around. But the important thing is that Indians are an engaging and friendly nation of people, who will do what they can to help travellers get by in this complex country. I spent a pleasant first evening over dinner with the Swiss guy from the homestay, where we traded stories about India over a beer and an excellent meal. It was great to get out to a quality restaurant in the heart of the entertainment district.



I set out next morning to explore Lalbagh botanical gardens, which is around five kilometres further out from the city centre. The park is
Central Bangalore
super impressive, featuring a vast variety of species set in luscious grounds. The gardens are so big I spent over two hours exploring the park, and bumped into several friendly Indian people who were happy to stop and chat. It's hard to believe you are in a bustling Indian city when strolling within the grounds of Lalbagh, and the park is highly recommended as a tourist destination. At the end of the day my auto driver was driving me back to the guesthouse when we got stuck in a traffic jam ... again! Anyways, a tout was selling genuine rayban sunglasses, and I beat him down to 200 rupees. That's incredible, I thought, only four dollars for the genuine article when they cost a fortune in Australia. My driver scolded me after the transaction, and said I should only have paid 100 rupees. Come on, I thought, two dollars for genuine raybans surely cannot be possible? So I handed over my old pair to placate him, and he sported them with pride while driving me home, often taking the time to style it up in the mirror.

During my final evening in India I packed up, farewelled the owners,
Lalbagh shrub
and jumped a taxi back to the airport. I had a flight booked to Colombo, and the only way to get there is to fly north to Mumbai, and link up with an international flight. I arrived at Mumbai domestic terminal around midnight with the plane thirty minutes late, feeling pressed for time, tired and sick. It was left to our friend's from Mumbai's unregistered taxi industry to administer a final kick up the arse before leaving the country, and they didn't miss! I was surprised there was noone around to help, and the sharks starting circling within an instant. I tried to fend them off, stating this wasn't a licensed taxi, where is the meter, why are there two of you in the car, how much etc but they were just too good for me. I was worried about my connecting flight, and they kept pressing the issue with rapid fire talking. Before I knew it I was in the car, they drove me a little, then stopped and produced some ridiculous brochure with prices on it. I was up for the equivalent of $65 to get to the international terminal, and had no idea how far it was.
Locals pose at Lalbagh
The only 'facts' I knew were the non stop lies spewing from their mouths. I had less than $40 cash in total, which they relieved me of in a flash, then fobbed me off to some poor sap who had the unpleasant task of driving me the 15 minutes to the airport. The sharks told me the international airport was 45 minutes away, and even a fare for that distance costs less than $10 dollars in India. On arrival we queued with tuk tuks, which the shysters swore were not allowed at the international terminal. I was furious, and told my driver in no uncertain terms how displeased I was with the unethical, exploitative and immoral behaviour of his associates. I think the guy was genuinely uncomfortable with the situation, as he's just a pawn in this well organised criminal racket!

Anyways, I maintained my rage all the way to Colombo, but eventually cooled off for the final day staying at Marine Tourist Guest House on Negombo beach. I was pleased to greet the friendly staff again, and gratefully climbed into a bed for several hours to have a kip. I took the opportunity to go for a long
Steps to High Court
walk along the beach in the afternoon, and dive in the water for a final swim before my flight home tonight. My trip to the Indian subcontinent has been unforgettable, including it's fair share of trials and tribulations. But what else can one expect visiting this unique region in the world, basically all of you should be here now!

It's home time, so until next time I'm signing off for now

cottage industry
rattan mat making by the five foot path under the canvas
Walking back from the restaurant, after a hefty meal, decided to take a walk down the streets of a small Indian vicinity, where I could see many shops, busy with people at the last minute shopping for groceries, getting their SIM cards, having a treat of Pani Puri by the five foot path whereby I have no guts to try, banana and corn sellers, and the rattan mat makers which I found it most interesting and unusual because this is supposed to be a cottage industry product. I thought BIG when product like this comes with skill involved. They have a canvas over their heads on the five foot path, making money with no rental incurred, working from morning till night, through rain and shine, having all three meals at the same place, just simply marvelous that made me smile with wonder. Yet they could do it in humility since the time they started. I guessed India is one place where you can do anything anywhere as they wish just to earn the humble living to feed the family.

I laughed most when I saw some cows waiting outside the Canara Bank with two Indians. Were the cows’ queuing for
the norm and the unusual clientele
cows and indians awaiting at the bank for banking transactions
the ATM? Certainly not, as there is no ATM machine at the bank. My mind became more naughty and cheeky, probably awaiting for the bank to open to do some banking transactions with milk and cheese. They are not cardholders, that’s for sure. This certainly is for good laughs.

Maybe Canara Bank should come out with slogans, “We Foresee The Banking Future”. “We Accept All Form Of Collaterals” or maybe “We Make Banking Easy”

Mysore, Hampi


Mysore
Disclaimer: no Abreva or latex was used in the making of this blog.



Ariel teased me that I would write a few entries in my blog and then neglect it for the rest of my trip... He was partly right. But I am back! So put down the pitchforks and torches.



I'm going to recount my two trips I've had so far within India: Mysore (sometime in July) and Hampi (this past weekend). Let me start by saying not all trips are created equal. Mysore is first up.



Last minute another expat here for only a few weeks invited me to go to Mysore, about a three and a half hour drive from Bangalore. As there was low Malaria risk, little cost involved, and I had been spending all my time in Bangalore, I signed up. Since it was quite a few weeks back, and I am struggling to care enough about this trip to recount it, I'll just sum it up below:



Mysore is only 88 mi away from Bangalore. In NY/NJ, you can cover 88 miles in just over an hour. In India, it takes three times
Hampi
as long. And there is a lot of fucking horn honking. Even when there are no other cars around.

There is a palace at Mysore. It is actually rather beautiful and breathtaking. However, you can't wear shoes inside and the floor is about as clean as a Rodeo. And there are a lot of tourists bumping into you. And you can't take pictures. Why? I was told they don't want the secret beauty of the palace advertised. Uhhhhh.

We went to the Olive Garden for lunch. Funny thing: I checked the corporate website, and the Olive Garden doesn't have a location in Mysore, India. Go figure.

Mysore, when translated directly to English, means ""lackluster"".

Our driver's ring tone on his cell was Justin Bieber's ""Baby""



Alright, now that Mysore is out of the way, Hampi time! Hampi was absolutely fantastic. This trip was also planned last minute, however, whereas Mysore was just three of us poor souls, Hampi was thirteen! Nine expats and four locals from work. To give you an idea of the adventure: the trip started out with thirteen people with luggage piling into a twelve person van. Luckily, we are all rather agreeable individuals and decided that it would be OK to take turns sitting on the floor. The driver had laid down an astro turf matt that ran the length of the van and, when padded with jackets and towels, wasn't all that bad. It was actually preferrable to some of the seats. I, being the lucky bastard that I am, was blessed enough to pick a broken seat. Before I go any further, let me disclaim that most everything so far, if not broken, has had a funny way of working. My seat in particular had a nice reclining function; except, the mechanism wasn't functioning properly, and everytime we hit a pot hole (which was approximately everything 3.5 minutes), my seat would go from a 135 degree recline, to 180 degrees and straight up to 90 degrees. This made sleeping a challenge on the 8.5 hour overnight trip.

Okay, now to the juicy stuff (and when I say juicy, it was literally juicy. Ready?). About 2.5 hours into the trip, the driver stopped for a potty break and some coffee. No, silly, we did not stop at a rest stop; those do not exist on the particular highway we took (and I doubt they actually exist on any highway in India). Instead, we stopped at a roadside stand, made of twigs and palm branches, and inhabited by other weary travellers and local animals (like, cows and dogs) alike. A bit sleepy and disoriented (it was now ~1:30 am and the driver had just made us watch Apocalypto) we all piled out of the van, looking for a place to relieve our bladders. The ladies scurried behind a hut, and the gentelmen searched for their own trees. Several guys were ahead of me and I struggled to find my way to the ""men's room"" as it was rather dark and I didn't have my glasses on. After finding my way over some rocky terrain (a product of dried mud and tractor wheels) I reached my friends. And, just as fate would have it, during my struggle to squint to see what was ahead of me, I violated the first rule of mobility in India: always watch the ground below your feet; you never know A. when there will cease to be ground there or B. what that ground is made of... And, so, as these things go, wearing my Cole Haan slip-ons, my right foot descended into what I can only imagine (hope) was a puddle of grabage mud, of a smell that, I promise you, YOU CANNOT IMAGINE. Holy fuck, it was disgusting; and not the regular kind of digusting, it was the most disgusting type of disgusting you can imagine. To this day, I still refer to that puddle of deplorable rubbish (I think it actually was rotting garbage mixed with mud and other ""things""), as mud, while my colleagues maintain that it was a mix of... well... I think it's time I move on.

After the ""mud"" incident, everyone hopped back onto the bus and ""passed out"" for the remainder of the trip (again, do not question my use of quotes. They are very deliberate). We arrived in Hampi at approximately 7:00 am and checked into our rooms. The ""resort"" we stayed at had absolutely magnificant grounds. The rooms were just alright, though they smelled like sweaty socks and farts a bit; nothing we could not bare after an 8+ hour drive. We all napped for two hours, caught our complimentary breakfast of North Indian cuisine (fluffy rice pancakes that kind of looked like uncrustables, chickpea stew, and COFFEE), showered and got dressed for a day of guided tours. Our tour guide, Raj, was extremely knowledgable and did a great job of dealing with 13 sleep deprived types-As. He brought us through the ruins of what was the Vijayanagara Empire's ancient capitals and gave us all a little bit of much needed history. We saw temples, road in boats, took plenty of pictures (check Facebook) and had an overall great time. And, surprisingly, no one got on anyone's nerves; somehow thirteen personalities seemed to mix just fine. Maybe we were all too tired to care, or maybe we were all so starved for something other than Bangalore that the sustinance that Hampi provided was enough to keep us all in good spirits. Either way, the long drive there and back, ruining my favorite shoes, and the sweaty sock-fart smell of our rooms were totally worth it. Hampi was just was the doctor ordered for all of us.

Hampi
Karnataka


We stop by Bangalore on our way to Hampi (only briefly - it is not a nice place - it's a big dusty noisy and unappealing city, we arrived at night and left immediately the next day!!)

The bus journey from Trichy to Bangalore is 8 hours. We took a private company KPN. The rickshaw bring us to a recommended place (by him).Some rickshaw drivers can be trusted but you have to get lucky. Most will recommend a hotel who will give them a commission for bringing customer and you will see the price of your room increase! Bangalore is just a short stop for our next destination: Hampi.


16/08 to 22/08 : Hampi


We embarked on Hampi Island (Viripur Gadi) to settle down at Shanti Guesthouse for few days before moving to Shiva Guesthouse (recommended by friends).

Shiva is owned by Olgan and family. There we lived in a very basic way but which shows to us that you don't need much to be happy in life.

The volcanic landscape is a bit mad around here. Some talk about a magical and spiritual forces, others about aliens and some with a
Hampi
geographical explanation. (Indians believe the Monkey god Hanuman placed the stones in Hampi) Either way whether by nature or a Hindi god - the scenery is otherwordly....

As a World Heritage Site, Hampi is very green surrounded with the rice fields on one side and desertic landscape and Ruins on the other.

It is a good start to try to understand the Hindu religion and history about the country itself. We took the service of a Rickshaw-guide to visit the Ruins who explain the Hindu religion and the history of the place. We did learn that the Arabs conquered Hampi during 1635 and destroyed some sites and temple to build their own legacy: Queen's palace - Lotus Palace - Elephant Stables.

A lot of places can be visited on your own as to be honest the Hindu religion is a bit complex (more than 3 millions names - reincarnation, avatars and divinations to remember).

On Hampi island, we visited the Hanuman temple monkey on the top of the mountain accessible by a 570 steps climb.

There is a nice contrast of colors between the green of rice field and coconut and banana plantation and the
Hampi
reddishness from the arid landscape(lava stone).

The current situation in Hampi is difficult as they are destroying people's home built near or using part of the Heritage walls. The State want to restore the site as a World heritage monument. To enable them to do so and to have more visitors and more profit we expect, they move people away , give them a land (3km away from Hampi) and 130.000 Rupees. Of course for people who had a business, this may not be a compensation for the loss of profit but one can understand that some houses were at risk and it will have been not safe for any one to stay under some very old stones...

Hampi is definitively an interesting place to be, full of history and mysteries. We were looking for something original and authentic... this is it! Incredible India...

Lord Shiva 1
Years back in 2003 I saw this wall poster of a white Lord Shiva statue in one of the Kodak Shop in Puchong, Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing picture I ever saw and I asked the owner of the shop where about is this place. She said India. I don't even know this God at all or his name so it was kind of difficult for me to search him in the internet those days. I shelved the whole idea until in 2005 I decided to visit Batu Caves, Kuala Lumpur only then I recalled and asked the Indians around who actually he is. I have constantly wanted to know him, doing researches on him, Indian friends of old and new like to tell me stories of him. The more stories I hear the more I want to see this statue in India. And so it happens in 2011 just before my birthday.

On my first day in Bangalore I visited this beautiful statue of Lord Shiva. Shiv Mandir is the name. My driver swerved into a car park. I asked where we are going. He said “To Shiv Mandir, the Lord Shiva Temple”. “Do we have to walk

far?” I asked. “No” he replied. It was just a few feet away into an exit and there stood the same statue I last saw in 2003. Exactly the same. I didn’t realize the Total Mall and Shiv Mandir shared the same car park. Any foreigner would have missed this place if not for the help of the locals. Remember it is on Old Airport Road.

The temple reached its completion in year 1995 was set on an auspicious day Maha Shivaratri as the inauguration day. The Lord Shiva statue is 65 feet high with River Ganga flowing out from his matted hair. In 1997, the Mount Kailash was added as backdrop behind the statue making the whole scenario more magnificent. The first Linga was founded in Mount Kailash(Tibet). It contained a natural Linga. On the whole of India, there are six natural Lingas discovered in six different states that marked these temples sacred by the Hindus.

In the Shiv Mandir, I saw statue of Lord Ganesha, the Elephant God as The God of Wisdom, a gallery of the seven Lingas, a long narrow path with probably about 3 feet wide, dark, wet and cold, contained its history
Lord Ganesha
and some words of wisdom for those believe in Lord Shiva. I like one particular word of wisdom, hope and encouragement he quoted. “Faith has Magic - When doctors gave up hope, you should not. If you have health problem, have faith in God, He can solve it.”. I was thinking of people suffering from Cancer, HIV and AIDS the moment I read this. I believe everyone has their own beliefs and miracles do happen.

I am glad I made this trip to see this Shiv Mandir. In reality it was better than the poster. The feeling is so nice and calm, thinking of the founder who had a dream to build this temple was not easy for him. He has no money to buy a piece of land and to build this dream place. But it was God’s blessings all that came to place, one after another; part by part with new statues, the gallery and the artificial Mount Kailash that took so many years was finally paid off. During the Maha Shivaratri, thousands of devotees throng to this place for this auspicious prayer and celebration. Thousands came to visit this Shiv Mandir throughout the year. Thanks to

Celebration? Yes, they should celebrate for having a place like this.

Aha...I'm a bit delayed in writing these next couple of posts. As the program progresses I'm getting less and less motivation, as it often goes with experiencing new things. At first it's really exciting and everything you do is new! and wonderful! and you want to use exclamation points to end all your sentences! But eventually you start to get used to things and don't try to learn as much. I think part of it, too, is that I haven't been able to get much exercise here so I'm losing my eternal endorphine high. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!

Anyway, back to actually reporting on the fun stuff. On Sunday we got the day off from hours and hours of lectures and got to go visit some sweet temples in Belur and Halebidu, Karnataka. Just as in our trip to Mysore, the bus rid was gruelingly long--a whopping 5 hours to get from our hotel to Belur. What changed, however was the space. Since a lot of people heard of the length of the bus ride and remembered the underwhelming trip that was Mysore (too much shuffling, not enough sights) a lot of them skipped out rather than get onto a bus at 4:30am. What this translated to was the entire back row of one of the buses--all 5 seats--reserved just for yours truly. So, of course, I went ahead and flopped my pillow down, plugged into my ipod and got ready for a few more hours of REM. Such a better ride than that to Mysore.

Not only was it a better ride because it was more comfortable, but the countryside was gorgeous. I slept for a couple hours then woke up to peer out the bus window. That part of India is mostly rolling hills, with coconut palm trees everywhere. I think most of the world's coconut product must come from there, because there were obscene amounts of palm trees. Sometimes off in the distance I'd see a rise of rock that could be considered an aspiring mountain, but mostly you could see to the horizon (over the palm trees, of course). I liked seeing this part of India much more than the cities, probably because I'm more of a country girl than a city girl. The towns were smaller, much more farms right up next to the road, and the occassional roadside food- or drink-stand. I really liked some of the houses we saw on the trip; the roof is usable as a patio and they have plaster outside that's been brightly painted so it looks wonderfully cheerful and nicely put together. Looked like a great place to come home to. Occasionally we'd pass through larger towns, that might be considered really small cities, but for a lot of the ride we were basically out in the country. I loved it, and really wanted to just get off the bus and go trekking (what they call backpacking) through the woods.

The main attraction in Belur was the Chennakesava temple. Because it is a hindu temple, you must take off your shoes before entering. Some leave them at the door, but rather than risk ours getting stolen we left them on the bus and walked barefoot from the bus to the temple. (Some of the other kids not used to walking barefoot had some trouble.) To be fully polite, you should also cover your knees and shoulders when entering the temple, but they seem to be a little more lax about letting foreigners in with shorts or tanks. The layout of the temple was similar to the one I saw at the Mysore palace, but on a much grander scale. Once you pass through the main tower-gate-thing you are confronted with an obelisk and a small statue that rest about 100 feet in front of you. I'm not sure what it signifies, but it must mean something because it's placed directly in your way in what otherwise would be a gigantic courtyard floored in stone blocks. In fact, pretty much everything except the doors are made of stone. That's what has made these temples so famous and attractive to tourists, is their stone carvings. And, honestly, I think they deserve the fame.

So, let me try and draw a map of this temple for you. The whole area it covers is roughly rectangular, surrounded by a stone wall about 10 feet high, sometimes higher in places. Let's say that the main gate is in the southern side of the wall. Then the obelisk and small statue are about 100 feet north of the gate. In the southeast corner there sits a ""tank,"" a 100ft-by-40ft green pool of water sunk about 40 feet down into the ground, with fish occasionally breaking the surface to grab a bug. Not sure what it was for, either, since the text on the sign had worn off to indecipherability. But there was a short wall around it and the entrance had a locked door so I figured I wasn't supposed to go closer. In the southwest corner there was an overhang that covered what looking like the makings of a parade in storage, wooden horses on wheeled platforms and suchlike, all painted gold, probably for some festival or another.

If you continue north past the obelisk you get to the main temple, a star-shaped stone-carved building that is elevated onto a star-shaped platform about 4-5 feet off the ground. As you climb the stairs to the temple you are supposed to touch them, to petition the gods to allow you to enter the sacred domain. The outside of the temple is covered, I mean literally covered, in stone carvings of the gods. There are thousands of hindu gods, if I remember correctly, and each one has bunches of incarnations as well. Some I remember, like Ganesh with the elephant head, and Shiva and Vishnu, but it would take a lifetime to remember them all. Our tourguide was very knowledgable, using a small hand-mirror to reflect the sunlight at a particular carving he was focusing on as he told us of the god-story that led to the carving. ""And here you see an incarnation of Shiva destroying a demon with just the fingernails of one hand, see how the carver made her fingertips pass through the demon's body and back out,"" or ""and here you see Ganesh lifting an entire mountain over his head, and you can see the hunter on the mountain and the farmer,"" and so on. An entire anthology of lore is contained on those wall, and it would be easy to miss without a guide.

There are three doors to the main temple building, two on the east and west sides (as I have designated, not sure of the true directions) and the main one on the south. The hallways from the doors converge on a round dais that is raised about 4"" off the ground. In the ceiling above the dais is a circular carved dome with more ornate carvings of the gods, and to the north of the dais is a small room where the priests keep care of the deities. People can leave offerings and take blessings there. The door was guarded by two incredible god statues that were carved from single pieces of stone, but carved so that the sprays of stone above her head almost look like lace, and it's raised up enough from the back wall that you can slip your hand beneath the stone and see your fingers through the many delicate holes. It's pretty nuts, the level of detail present in these temples.

I didn't stick with the guide for much of the Belur temple, because I hadn't found much use for our guide at Mysore and I wanted to try and interact with the local people at the temple and I figured that wouldn't happen surrounded by a group of foreigners. So, I wandered off and snapped photos of cool statues that I liked. My idea turned out to be successful, a couple times people (mostly children) would say ""hello"" to me and giggle when I smiled and said ""hello"" back. A duo of girls came up again after going through the hello-giggle performance and shook my hand, asking me something that I eventually construed to be asking my name, then where I was from, then my mother and father's name. After deciphering their accented english and answering their questions, they then asked for 100 Rupees, which set me laughing as I told them no. The way they asked it was really funny, because it felt like they'd been told stories about how foreigners were free with their money and wanted to see if it was true. They didn't badger at all like some beggars or vendors may do. They just asked, and then left when I laughed and said no. Another lady asked me where I was from, then wished me a good stay. And once you start taking pictures with people, man, there is no stopping. I saw a couple of boys trying to take surreptitious photos of Fae and I from around a corner, so I leaned over and mimicked a camera and asked if they wanted a photo. Of course they said yes, but what I didn't realize was that there were about eight more of them around the other side of the corner, so then I had about four rounds of pictures with two or three boys on each side. It's wicked fun, to have a lot of people asking for their picture with you. ;D

The other notable thing we saw at Belur was an engagement party! In the northwest corner of the temple there was a sort of elevated patio that was crowded with men and women, just sitting. I avoided it myself, not wanting to intrude on whatever was happening over there. Eventually I met up with Naveet, Sumedha, and Fae, and the two Indian girls explained that it was a wedding (we later learned it was just an engagement) and Fae wanted to go and see. Apparently it was okay, so we wandered up the steps and crowded near the back of people. The bride and groom were sitting on the floor in an open space, next to each other and both facing the crowd. They both had red dots on their forehead and there was some sort of ceremony going on as a women holding a plate with cups and a candle on it was passing in front of them, but I couldn't see what she did. Fae wanted to give her blessings to the bride and groom, so she got some advice from Naveet and permission from someone from the wedding party and went up to the front of the crowd. I stayed in the back, not wanting to draw more attention away from the bride and groom then I already had. Apparently, to give blessings at an engagement you sprinkle rice on the head of the bride and the groom, dip a finger in tumeric and press it to the center of their foreheads, then dip your finger in red and mark the same spots on their foreheads. I heard people laugh while Fae was up there, apparently she dipped her thumb in the red and pressed firmly to the groom's head, who leaned back in surprise, making it look like she had poked him very hard. I asked Naveet afterwards, and the proper way to do it seems to be to stick out your ring finger, using your thumb to keep your other fingers back, and dip the finger into the dye lightly and mark lightly. So if I ever make it to an Indian engagement, I'll be prepared. ;D

After the temple at Belur we hopped back on the bus and traveled a short distance to the Halebid temple. The temple was different from the Mysore and Chennakesava temple in that it was not surrounded by a gigantic wall, and there were grassy areas surrounding the temple that made it seem very peaceful. The carvings there were just as impressive as those at Chennakesava, if not more so. This time I stuck closer to the tour guide and got to hear more stories about the carvings of the gods. But, there's not much more to say that I didn't say above, so I can't embellish any more...

After seeing that temple we went to lunch at a local resort, where we got to have a tasty buffet lunch. I got to have my favorite dessert of all time, gulab jamoon. I can't remember if I've written about it before, but it is so glorious that it deserves some more words. Perhaps a poem. An ode. A sonnet. A thorough and solid declaration of my love for the deliciousness that is gulab jamoon (with ice cream) and for the man who first made it. Gulab jamoon is some sort of dough that has been rolled into a ball and then cooked in a sugar syrup until it has reached a level of tastiness that places it upon deity-status. It is usually served with ice cream, and if you are blind and get two scoop of ice cream with two gulab jamoon and a little extra syrup sprinkled on top you will see once again. If you are lame, you will walk. If you are deaf you will hear. It is that freaking good. They also had fruit trifle and stuff, but I don't really care about that. After that, we piled back into the bus to come back to Bangalore, with a stop for snacks and tea along the way. So, would I recommend Belur and Halebidu to others visiting India? In a heartbeat!

August 2nd 2012
Published: August 2nd 2012


Yesterday we got a day off from lectures and instead we got to go sightseeing! We woke up early and piled on the bus at 5am to take the ~200km trip to Mysore. In a car or on a motorcycle it probably wouldn't have taken too long, but on a huge trundling bus the trip there took around 3 hours. NOT my favorite way to spend the morning, but I'm pretty flexible about where I can sleep. And, in fact, I would have slept quite well on the bus since I smuggled a hotel pillow out and planned to prop myself up in a corner and snooze and drool until we reached our destination. (Okay, ""smuggling"" is a bit strong. I kinda just walked out with it...) But, there was something that I did not account for. The roads here have a lot of speed bumps, and they are BIG speedbumps. Add that to the fact that I was sitting in the back of the bus and you get quite a rough ride. The driver was relatively good at slowing down, so on most of the bumps you just felt your stomach and brain lift up but nothing big. One bump, though, left all of us in the back at least a couple inches off of our seats. Better than coffee for waking up, that.

Our first stop was in Mysore, outside of pit stops, was at the royal palace. I learned a lot of history of India on this trip, and much of it from someone other than our tour guide. I spent some time talking to Professor Sriram, who grew up in India, did his undergrad in Thailand, and is now professing in New York. He was a walking fount of knowledge, I tell you. But I digress! In the early days (before Indian independence) India consisted of a collection of states: Karnataka, Kerala, etc. The British didn't rule so much, as just trade with the maharajas and sultans. (Both maharajas and sultans are kings of a certain area, but I think one is muslim and one is hindi. I can't remember exactly. Google it if you're curious. :D ) The British provided the rulers with soldiers to enforce their authority, and in return the maharajas et al over-taxed the people and gave a large portion of that to the British. I'm not sure why, but India was rolling in dough back then, something about the country got them a lot of money. That's also why a lot of Indian artifacts are chillin' over in Britain right now.

So, you may ask, where does Mysore come into all of this? There is a palace there, a huge wonderful palace where the son of the last maharaja of Karnataka now lives. At some point they restructured the government to remove the political power of the maharajas, and so when the last maharaja died in 74 his son did not become the next maharaja, but remained a prince. And since the prince is in his late 50s and has no children it's not looking promising for the royal line. I don't think this prince is complaining, though. The last maharaja agreed to let the public tour a small portion of the palace in exchange for 20%!o(MISSING)f the fees acquired. That's a crap-ton of money, because that placed is jammed with tourists. Apparently the government is refusing to pay his son, though, and there's a case in court to figure out if the prince gets royalties from the tourism. (Ha, royalties, get it? 'Cause he a prince, and all.)

The palace is pretty grand, bigger than the Palacio Real in Madrid but a bit more worn-down. You can't wear your shoes in, so you get to put them into a bucket and prance around barefoot. Well, I pranced. But that's me. The floors were mostly tiled, apparently with tiles from England, with stairs of concrete near the entrance. The ceilings were plastered with colorful designs, and there was some beautiful stained glass from Glasgow. In fact, a lot of the palace features were imported from other countries. It was that fact that prompted me to ask Professor Sriram how these maharajas could afford such glamour, and that was when he started telling me the history of India. My favortie feature of the palace was a courtyard, about 25 yards wide and 35 yards long, near the center of the palace. There was nothing really interesting in the courtyard, no fountains or statues in the center, and we weren't even allowed to go in it as all the entrances were blocked by nets. But I really liked the feel of it. There was a small stair set at one edge of the courtyard, about 6 stairs or so, with statues of snarling leapords on each side facing inwards, and a spiral staircase on another wall up to the second floor. A breeze would occassionally come from the open sky above and ruffle the nets, or my hair as I leaned out the windows that lined the edges and it was really easy to imagine the maharaja standing on the stairs, surrounded by attendants and holding court between those two leapord statues. Also it looked like a great place for a bollywood dance scene. :D

The palace grounds also featured a hindu temple which I got to wander around in. There's a sort of entranceway into the temple where you leave your shoes--you're also supposed to cover your knees and shoulders in deference to the gods. The main temple sat in the center, a building made out of granite pillars with ridiculously ornate carvings at the top. The wooden doors to that temple were shut and locked, so I'm not sure what deity/cod/goddess resided there. There was another building with a pooja room near the back corner, and this one was open and accepting supplicants. You can walk into the small room, stand on a table covered in rangoli-like artwork and the preists (or whatever they're called) will wave some incence in front of the statue and offer you some sacred water to splash on your mouth and head. I did not partake of the ceremony, but we were with Professor Sriram and got to watch what he did. The priests offered a silver platter with a burning lamp on it, he put down some rupees (not sure how much), then they offered him the bowl of sacred water.

Part of the fun of Mysore was what happened outside the palace grounds. I mentioned above that Mysore is a huge tourist attraction. Well, there is nothing foreigners are better at than paying to much for useless junk. So there are all sorts of peddlars right outside Mysore, and they are aggressive. I wasn't interested in buying anything, and I knew the rules: stare straight ahead, ignore them even if they're in your way or your face, and give them no reason to think that you are interested. Don't justify why you aren't going to buy their things. Don't stop, just keep walking. I found their flutterings hilarious and soon enough they left me alone. Some of the other kids, though, showed a bit of interest and were BOMBARDED. Reggie asked a fan-seller how much one cost when going in, and the man even followed him when we were coming out. To get to the bus we had to get through a narrow walk of stalls, and we temporarily lost a lot of kids as we were inundated. After I got on the bus the first time we realized one of the kids from China was missing, and I'd seen him interacting with the sellers before and knew he wouldn't be good at just walking through them and saying no. And if I knew, then the peddlers knew. It's like blood in the water, and you know they'll buy something from you just to get you away. So I left the bus to go escort him back, trying to use my body to get in between him and the peddlars. It was super-fun, like being a body-guard. And even once we were on the bus they didn't stop! They stood outside our windows and waggled their products at us. Sam thought it was ridiculous so she started making faces out the window, much to their amusement. I thought it looked like fun so I joined in, too. Some fan-seller in Mysore has a picture on their phone of Sam with her cheeks puffed out and me cross-eyed.

We ate lunch in the basement club of some fancy hotel, and it was wicked. The entrance to the club looks like a barrel, then you walk into this short tunnel with lit crystal in the floor, and then you get to the club-turned-restaurant. They set up buffet tables on the slightly elevated dance floor, and there were tables and cars around the outside for eating. That's right, they had two cars set up with tables in the club. It was super-fun. The decor was chic-western, with black walls and blue LEDs to simulate the night sky. The food was super-tasty--six types of desserts! Pulab jamoon (I think, I can't remember the exact name) with ice cream, ""bread pudding,"" a fruit-casserole thing, some sort of fruit-pancake-pastry thing, and some tasty cookie-things whose name I can't remember. I didn't keep very good track of what I was eating--I was too busy snarfing it down and wishing I had a faster metabolism. I'm pretty sure I've gained at least 5 pounds on this trip already. Too much eating, not enough unicycling! But I'm not worrying about it since I'm only getting this chance for a limited amount of time. I'm also getting really good at eating with my hand properly--I've realized the trick is to scoop the food up with my four fingers, then slide my thumb from my palm towards my fingertips to flip the food into my mouth. I'm an Indian-food-eating pro, man.

After lunch we moseyed over to sultan Tipu's summer house, also in the Mysore area. The story behind that was interesting; Tipu did not like British sovereignty so he opposed them and fought. It didn't turn out so well for him, though. After winning one bought with the British they came back en force and razed the huge fort that used to be near the palace and killed Tipu. There are some impressive wall paintings in the summer house that depict the battles with the British (before Tipu was killed, I think) and other famous people that I really didn't pay much attention to. After that we hung out on the grounds for awhile, and that was quite peaceful. I met two new Indian guys, Surya and Sasi (whose name means sun and moon, respectively. they should be friends for life.), and chilled with them on the lawn. I think they weren't quite sure what to do with me; even though I ate lunch with them and Kiri and they smiled whenever I wandered around it looked more like one of the nervous smiles I see when people don't know what to expect of you here. I was nice, though, and didn't chatter or anything. Just sat and enjoyed the breeze and the wonderful weather they have in this part of India. Our last stop of the day was a collection of stores on the outskirts of town that were arranged almost like a city square. The complex was absolutely deserted, though, so it was obvious that our tour program had some sort of deal with the owners that they would bring in batches of tourists on a bus. I was a bit bummed; I had hoped for something like the insanity outside of Mysore. Ah, well. Can't win 'em all! After that, we piled back on the bus and made our slow way back to Bangalore. Fun day, in general, but I would have loved to tool around by myself for several days. Maybe I'll tour India on a motorcycle one day. :D

I can tell we're all getting tired of this break-neck pace, here in India. It's getting harder to convince myself to blog every day, which is why I've gone and missed one yesterday. Sorry everyone! But not really much happened yesterday, so there's not a whol lot to report. I convinced Bala to order me a ""cheese burst"" pizza from Domino's, non-veg. It was delivered to my room in less than 30 minutes just like they promised (I was really surprised) and was pretty tasty. The sauce is more BBQ than tomato, and the toppings are similar to a supreme pizza. The difference is the ""cheese burst"" part--they put a bunch of melty cheese between layers of crust on the bottom. It's pretty darn tasty, though ridiculously rich. I should not have eaten as much of my medium pizza that I did, but I finished the rest the next morning anyway.

Tonight we had a girls' night in my room, which meant snacks and Bollywood! Naveet has a super-nice hp computer with ridiculously good sound, so we set it up on a table in front of my bed, plopped into comfy positions and started watching! The movie in question is called ""Jab We Met,"" a romantic comedy from 2007. The story centers around an energetic, bubbly girl who meets a heartbroken guy on the train. She then gets all up in his business and, of course, hilarity ensues. We only got through the first half, but already the romantic sparks are starting to fly. (You see, it took that long because she has a boyfriend she plans to elope with. We haven't gotten that part resolved yet.) The male actor is good at brooding and occassionally flashing glimpses of teeth in a small smile while sneaking glances at Geet. One of the kids from China in my program, Chen, looks a bit like the actor, so it was a lot of fun comparing the mannerisms of the two. I'm eager to finish, though it will be a couple days.

Onto my second topic: women in India. Honsetly, I don't fully understand the complex dynamics that occur here. On one hand there is the traditionalist side of things. The large majority of women wear traditional clothing, like saris or (more commonly) kurtis with loose pants, leggings, scarves, etc. I've been warned not to wander the streets alone, though I'm moderarely sure I'd be okay before 11am. Women and men are not friends; I do not think I have seen a women and man walking the street together unless they were married. In Jab We Met, Geet gets stranded at a bus station and almost immediately starts getting harrassed by a group of men. The buses have trouble with men sexually harassing women. I read in the paper about a case in Mangalore (a city in the same state as Karnataka but pretty distant) where groups of young men considering themselves moral keepers gang up on people who are partying in the city, and probably harass women for wearing non-traditional clothing as well. The state's getting slammed because the officials in Mangalore are traditionalist-minded as well, and therefore are not as diligent about catching the ""goons"" as they could be. When I told Prakash that I drove myself to school he was surprised; even something that we consider as meaningless as driving could be an unusual privelage here. I don't fully get the picture of women in India, I need to ast Naveet and Sumedha for some of their experiences. And probably some of the Indian guys, too, since they see the other side of it. As a foreign woman I am in a unique position, since I can interact with both groups freely.

Whew! I'm tired. I think I've been fighting some sort of sickness for the last two days or so. Perhaps that sore throat that's been going around has caught up to me. I was doing really well up till recently but I think this lack of sleep these last couple days is what tipped me over the edge from 100% to 90%. I'm still fighting it and hope to get to bed soon so I can sleep and recover, but I had to write blog posts for the last three days since I've been so busy. I was supposed to do work for my advisor today, as well, but it took me this long to get the posts written that now I am just going to go to bed after this. Whoops.

Nothing very exciting today, no adventures, just an evening jaunt to a close restaurant named Al-Bek that I wanted to write about. I went with Tim, Sumedha, Naveet, Jeyandran, Prakash, Ganesh, and Hussain. The place was packed, but we got lucky and a table opened up about 5 minutes after we got there. Tim says it's been packed every time he's been there, and he's been there several times for dinner on varying nights. Like a lot of the fast-food restaurants on our street there are two floors, which is necessitated by the lack of real estate in the city. Things are much more spread-out in the states, there is space and areas and parking lots between buildings. Not here. And since they can't build out, they build up. So the second floor is basically a wide balcony with several tables that overlooks the standing area below.

We ordered several curry dishes and a couple noodle dishes, not to mention some roti (flatbread). I practiced eating like a proper South Indian, with my right hand only and no utinsel. I spooned some chicken fried rice onto the plate, topped it with some masala (sauce) from one of the dishes, mixed the whole thing up with my fingers and went to town. I'm still pretty bad at successfully getting the rice from the plate into my mouth without getting extra rice on my face or dropping it into my lap, but I think I did okay overall. I had a slice to drink, which was a good choice because some of the dishes were a bit spicy and Slice is the best thing to cut spiciness, outside of curds, which I didn't think they offered. After dinner I washed my hands and face in one of the washbasins they offer in South Indian restaurants, copying Sumedha by only rubbing my right hand by itself, not with my left, and copying Naveet by cupping water to wash and rinse out my mouth. I'm torn on how I feel about eating in a South Indian style. On one hand I love the idea of eating my food with my hands. On the other, I'm not sure if I like getting my hands messy. Then again, if you round off the meal with roti and then a napkin your hands come away surprisingly clean. And the washbasins are provided in almost all restaurants, even if a washroom is not.

Some of you may ask, ""Why Jenni, how could you possibly have seen lions and tigers and bears at the ANCRiSST workshop you were supposed to attend today?"" Well, my dear readers, there are two likely possibilities. The first is that the workshop hosts decided to bring a menagerie at lunch to entertain us guests--not an unlikely scenario considering the immense hospitality I've seen here--and the second is that I skipped out on the conference. As you may have already guessed, I did indeed play hooky today! After talking late into the night with Bala, Hussain, et al. I heard their plans to skip out on the conference and go see some tigers at Bannerghatta National Park. Naturally I was thrilled at the opportunity to a) get some extra sleep, b) have another adventure in India, c) hang out with my new friends from various countries, and d) see some wicked-cool animals.

My plan was to sleep until 9:30 or so, since we were up until 2, but that didn't pan out. Unfortunately the front desk called around 8:30 to tell me the bus was ready and that they wanted everyone to get on it. Ooh, side-track here. Another example of how India is different from the U.S.: on the first day Dr. Ramaswamy, one of the main organizers, told us not to be late and not to miss the bus. The problem is that they count the number of people on the bus and they won't leave until there are either 50 students on the bus or they've called every single room. This means that, now that people have figured out that they can skip lectures and not really miss anything, we often end up waiting for at around 30 minutes on the bus. Just another example of what I am beginning to affectionately refer to as ""India time.""

Well, I didn't get my precious beauty sleep because of the hotel call and I was not really able to get back to sleep after that. So there was nothing left but to stagger up, take a shower and go grab some breakfast upstairs. I then hung around for awhile, watched some TV, and waited for word from Bala and Tim about when we were going to go see some giant cats.

We ended up leaving the hotel around 11:30am: Yuuki (nickname: Shimapu), Bala, Hussain, Tim, Rodrigo, and myself. Our method to get there was bus to the central transportation area, then switch buses to get to Bannerghatta, which I would never in a thousand years have tried without Bala. You see, Bala grew up near Bangalore (in Mysore, I think) so he speaks Kannada, the native language here. This makes him invaluable because even though the national language is Hindi, not everyone speaks Hindi. And Bala also speaks Hindi, just in case, so we had an excellent companion to chauffer us around.

The buses were a fascinating experience. Apparently there are three classes of buses: the cheap, the slightly-less-cheap, and the not-really-cheap. I think we took the middle-class bus for both legs of the journey on the way there, but honestly I'm not really sure. We just all gave Bala 100 Rs at the beginning and let him do all the talking. When we got onto the first bus I stood with the guys near the door, but before long the conductor tapped me on the shoulder and indicated a seat near the front of the bus. That's right, the buses are gender-segregated here. I'm not exactly sure how much of it is out of respect and how much of it is to prevent harrassment. I had read on wikitravel before coming that if a woman sits on a bench or a bus seat where a man is sitting, the man may get up to give you the whole seat, and that in that case the man is being respectful and not rude. But then Tim told me that he had read in the paper that there was a huge problem with men harrassing women on the buses here. I think it's also a problem for women walking at night, because when I talked about walking about a block to the hotel by myself the Indian guys I was with told me to wait and they'd walk with me. I'm honestly not sure if I'd get harrassed walking alone on the streets at 8pm, since I'm not Indian, but even if it was a possibility I wasn't really concerned. I mean, what could they do? If they tried to verbally harrass me I wouldn't understand since I don't speak Kannada or Hindi. If they tried to physically harrass me I'd knock them ass over teakettle since I am usually at least 4 inches taller and 30 pounds heavier. I waited, though, for they guys' peace of mind.

Anyway, back to the buses. I sat up front with the girls, occassionally accompanied by Shimapu who had to give up his seat anytime ladies came onto the bus. When people get on the bus they stand around until eventually the conductor makes his way to you, asks where you are going, then takes your money and gives you a ticket. You don't bargain for bus tickets, just like you don't bargain for food. In India, there aren't little bell pulls on buses to indicate you want to get off the bus. If you're a lady I suspect you make your way to the front door and tell the driver or conductor that you want to get off. If you're a man you whistle to tell the bus to stop. It's the same whistle Indian men need to develop if they want to stop an auto. Apparently foreigners can make do with waving their arm, but Indian guys need to whistle to get an auto to stop. I had heard that whistling is rude, and Bala had told me a couple days ago that they did it to call taxis or tease girls. So as I was sitting on this bus, facing backwards because that's how my seat was, I heard a lot of insistent whistiling and thought ""great, someone's harassing the blond chick on the bus."" I didn't want to encourage the person, so I insistently stared out the window. At one point I tried to sneak a glance around the bus to see if I could find out who was whisting at me and accidentally made eye contact with a man standing about halfway back. Of course I went back to staring out the window and of course I heard the whistling again after that. So then I did not bother sneaking glances inside the bus, I just stoically stared out. I even thought I heard someone giving the whistler a set-down in some non-English language because I didn't hear any whistles after that. But when I asked Bala--who'd been sitting in the back of the bus, facing backwards as well--at Bannerghatta if someone had been whistling at me on the bus he laughed and told me no. The whole time it was people whistling to stop the bus. Aaaaaaaaaand since I'd stared out the window I couldn't have known that. Whoops.

The trip to Bannerghatta took about 2 hours total because our second bus stopped at basically every stop. We started getting excited when could look out the window and see what looked like a forest. The park was definitely a tourist trap: there were food stands, kids selling bubbles, and a ferris wheel, just to name a few. We purchased tickets for the bus safari--about twenty people squished onto a bus that drives through the enclosures of different animals--for 210 Rs per person, which is a pretty decent price (about $4). We then walked over to the waiting area, which was a square area surrounded by a waist-high wall with a granite-topped bench to sit and a roof with clay tiles. After waiting for around 5 minutes we were ushered onto a green bus lined with two-person seats on each sides, with holes for cameras on the grates that covered the window. Somehow in the maneuvering it ended up that Bala, Tim, Rodrigo, and myself were in the front, and after awhile we got Shimapu and Hussain in the front as well.

As it turns out, this was no accident. Anytime we stopped to see animals, from the spotted deer in the beginning to the lions near the end, the ""guide"" (in quotes because he didn't do anything but accompany the driver) and driver would take our cameras from our hands and lean out the windows to take pictures for us. I ended up just laying back a lot, or looking at the animals with my own eyes rather than on my camera screen. It seems that this happens all the time, they seat the foreigners up front and take their cameras to take pictures, knowing that a lot of Westerners will feel guilt-tripped into giving a tip at the end of the safari. It's how Fae lost a bunch of money at the Mumbai airport: guys kept taking her bags and carrying them places without her asking, then indicating that she needed to give a tip. And Fae, being nice Fae, gave all of them 50 Rs tips, even if it was one guy carrying her bag and accompanied by three others. So it seems this is a common scheme: do something nice for the foreigners to make them think they are obligated to pay you. Obviously it's a good scheme and it works. That being said, I did not tip the driver or the ""guide"" at the end of the safari. Rodrigo did, though.

The safari started off with the more tame animals, like spotted deer, alligators, and some other hooved creatures, and progressed to more and more exotic. The first animals are all in one really large enclosure, since the alligators probably get fed and are unlikely to want to eat the deer. The bus then passed through a double-gate into the bear enclosure. The bears in this enclosure were sloth bears, and they looked kind of like shaggy black bears with dog-like paws and goofy muzzles. As soon as we got into the enclosure there was a bear right next to the bus, and a bit later one of them put his paws up on the side of the bus to sniff. I would guess that sometimes people feed the bears out of the bus and this one was hoping to get a snack.

After the bear enclosure can the lions, which were my favorite animal of the safari. I'm not sure I've seen a lion up close like this, and these guys are beautiful. Their heads are gigantic--as big as my unicycle wheel--and their golden eyes are rimmed in dark so that when they turn their heads to look at you it seems like they can see straight into your soul. One of them was pacing next to a gate that either held food or a lionness, and watching him pace back and forth was amazing. He was so quick, so powerful, it was exhilirating and I was glad the guide had taken my camera because it meant I could just watch him move. After that we saw Bengal tigers, then Siberian tigers, but to me they just couldn't compare to the lions. They're definitely pretty, and I definitely decided that anyone who hunted tigers should be slapped in the face with a fish, but I still liked the lions better. Though I did not get to see a pair of lions mate, as I did with the tigers, since I think they keep the lionesses in a separate enclosure from the lions until they choose to breed them. Nor did I get to see a lion take a bath, as one of the siberian tigers did when we were near.

Once the safari was over we wandered around to scrounge up some lunch. Bala bought two ears of corn from a vendor-lady, one had been boiled and one had been cooked over an open fire. Both were very good; the boiled corn was basically the same as in the states except for the tasty spice on it, and the fired corn had harder kernels, almost like unpopped popcorn but not quite. Tim and Rodrigo did not partake, fearing the possible digestive repercussions that could come of eating street food, especially with a 2-hour bus ride back to Bangalore. We ate lunch at a restaurant in the park, but I didn't check its name nor would I have likely remembered it anyway. I ordered chicken noodles, since it was something I'd never had before, and was a bit dissapointed when I got something similar to what I might get as chow mein in a Panda Express. Turns out the noodle dishes here are approximations of Chinese food, just like we have back home. So I know now to not eat the noodle dishes if I want something exotic. I did get a Fanta, though, which is popular there. In fact, the most popular sodas that you see offered everywhere are the main labels you'd see in America, like 7up, Pepsi, Sprite, Coke, but also Fanta and the delicious non-carbonated mango drink Slice. I think the carbonation is lower here, which I really like, and the drinks are in glass bottles that look beat up and are fun to drink from.

The bus ride back to the central transportation hub was much shorter because we picked a nicer bus that didn't make as many stops. Another nice thing about it was that it was not gender-segregated, so I got to sit with Bala and the other in the back. Once we got to the hub we took an auto the rest of the way, because it was peak traffic hours and a bus would a) take FOREVER and b) be ridiculously crowded. And that was just the first half of the day.

That night we went out with a couple of professors to The Tavern, a pretty nice bar inside the Inn at Museum Road. I think it was made for foreigners because it felt almost exactly like any nicer bar back in the states and also played American music like stuff from The Fray and Pearl Jam. I had a chocotini for the ridiculous (at least in India) price of 330 Rs post-tax and got to hang with everyone. Sumedha had us play a game, basically charades where you chose what you want to act, and it was a lot of fun playing with kids from all over the world. We even got a little nerdy, too: I pantomimed a mode shape with my hand which someone guessed correctly, and someone else tore up a napkin to show the finite element method and someone got that, too. It was really fun! And since most of the bars in India close around 11pm, I still got back in time to get most of a good night's sleep. :D

It only took two shopping trips, a trip to a back-alley tailor, and a couple hours of chaos but we finally got to wear our saris! It took the three of us (Sam, Fae and myself) a long time to get ready because we didn't know how to put on saris at all, of course, and Sumedha did not have much practice at getting them to look just right. I got to put on my sari first, and even though it took awhile we were able to get my sari fully assembled with just Sumedha's and Naveet's help. When we tried to get Fae and Sam set up, though, they couldn't quite get the whole thing arranged. Their saris were two-toned, which made it a bit harder to get it to look right, and the girls are shorter than I am so they had to tuck a lot of fabric into the petticoat. Faced with such complications, what did we do? Call up one of the ladies who worked down in reception! Since they wear saris every day we hoped that they could finish up Sam and Fae properly and, sure enough, in no time at all they had been transformed into Indian princesses!

So, a bit of description on the whole sari outfit. There are three parts to a sari: the petticoat, the blouse, and the sari itself. The petticoat is just a simple underskirt that has a string to tie near the waist and falls all the way to the ground. It is suposed to match the color of the sari exactly, but mine was a bit darker than my sari and seemed to work just fine. The sari usually has some sort of border on the edge, say a thick ribbon, to edge it off. When you buy a sari it will often come with a strip of fabric to make a blouse, which you then take to a tailor. The sleeves of the blouse have the same edging as the sari, which makes the whole outfit look really shmancy. The style of the blouse is basically a t-shirt that ends a couple inches below your breasts, and features either hooks in front or a zipper under the arm, and loops in the shoulders that snap around your bra strap to keep it properly in the blouse.

The sari assemblage starts with putting on the petticoat and the blouse. Then one edge of the sari is tucked into the petticoat over the right hip and wraps around the waist (towards the left hip first) to get one layer of the sari as a skirt. Then a length of the sari is accordion-folded to give a bustle of fabric that sits in the front. All of these bits are tucked into the petticoat, which is how the whole thing stays together. We also used a safety pin to keep the folds together. Once the bustle is tucked into the front of the sari, the length of fabric that is left over is taken up and over the left shoulder. You can chose whether to pin the whole bit of fabric up on your shoulder, leaving your shoulder bare and exposing a bit of midriff on your side, or you can just pin one edge on the shoulder and leave the rest of the fabric to drap over your arm and shoulder. Some women take the extra length and wrap it so it tucks back into the sari, which seems a practical way to wear it because then you won't have the extra fabric flowing around and getting in the way when you try to sit.

Just like any elaborate outfit, learning to move in a sari took a bit of work. Walking was relatively easy to pick up, since the skirts fall just above your toes. I did have a bit of trouble when walking uphill since your chances of stepping on the hem are greatly increased. And, of course, stepping on the hem basically guaranteed that you'd pull the sari out of the petticoat and would have to go to the washroom to rearranged yourself. Walking up steps or getting on the bus was excessively nerve-wracking because you need to grab your skirts and lift them to get up the step, and you can't lift your skirts too high or you look indelicate. Not only that, you have to be sure to grab ALL of the bustle and the petticoat, or you'll step on the sari and pull it out. I did pretty well in general, never stepping on the hem really badly. At one point in the evening I noticed my sari was falling out and I had to go fix it, but that seemed to be from normal motions of standing, sitting, walking, etc.

We were quite the sensation. I am used to standing out, I mean, you don't see many 6' tall blond girls dressed in guy shorts and tanks very much in India, so I got used to people looking at me. This was nothing like that. As soon as the three of us reached the lobby of the hotel everyone looked at us, and I could feel it was a different look. When you're foreign, people might look at you and see your foreign clothes, but it's not an excessively interested look. These were interested looks. There are a group of Indian guys staying in our hotel for some medical conference and we had the attention of every single one. Our auto driver complemented me (through Naveet) saying that many foreigners dressed in jeans and t-shirts and it was nice to see one in traditional Indian clothing. He then looked at me in the rearview mirror, smiled and said ""very nice."" In fact, we got that reaction from a lot of the Indian men in service positions, like waiters and such like. Always a ""very nice"" and a smile. I smiled back and said thanks every time. Luckily for me I have no problem being the center of attention, but Sam was really shy at the beginning and even hid from pictures! She got better, though. :D

As it was, the evening didn't end with the banquet. Some kids from the k-mob (Korea) brought some liquor from Korea, called soju, so after ditching the sari (which was not good for lounging) I hung out with them and kids from the i-co and j-crew in the hotel room next door. I can't really describe the taste of soju, since I only had a little. Mostly I was drinking Kingfisher beer that we swiped from the minibar and will replace...eventually. That's one nice thing about the general disorganization of India--it's easy to do things like drink from the minibar and replace with stuff you buy at the market later. ;D Once the group in Yuki's room had winded down, a core group of us relocated to a different room to continue hanging and chatting. I got to ask Hussain about Islam, and he talked about the Koran and Ramazan and the comparisons between Christianity and Islam. They're about 1/3 of the way through Ramazan right now, which means that Hussain can't eat or drink from sunrise to sunset, which is still mind-boggling to me. My friend Sabreen had done Ramazan (though she called it by its arabic name Ramadan) back in undergrad and I was impressed then. We were up really late just talking and exchanging stories, and I think that it's been one of my favorite experiences so far.

I am very tired today; staying up so late blogging is not good for me! After lectures us girls and Gift (pronounced ""jift"") and Duan went to pick up our saris from the tailor and buy some accessories. I got earrings and bangles, and will be wearing my dress sandals that I bought. Apparently it's going to take 2 hours for us to fully get ready so we're going to ditch the entire afternoon workshop session to have time to prepare. Don't tell on us, 'kay?

I'm going to go to bed now--it may only be 9:45 but I need my sleep and the bus leaves at 7am tomorrow morning (ugh). 'Night.

Photo 2
I'm posting this six days late, but below is my experience registering with the Foreign Regional Registration Office:

Good day comrades!

I am sitting in a cafe, ""The French Loaf"" in Indiranagar as I write this. I've just ordered myself a coffee and a donut (quiet, gays!). No one here seems to know what a black coffee is, and no matter what you order, it's a cappuccino. Le sigh.

I arrived at the FRRO this morning at 8:35; twenty minutes late. My assistants (yes, plural) from ISO were already waiting for me. They saved me a spot in line and had all of my documents completed. My only job, as explained by Lohith, was to stand in line and get my token. After that, I was to promptly report back to him for further instruction. To my surprise, the office opened five minutes early and the crowd of foreigners waiting with me piled into the FRRO in an orderly fashion. The day was off to a smooth start.

I was seventeenth in line, making me token 17. After I retrieved my token, Lohith told me that I was then to sit on the ground floor until they called me. At such time, I was to report to the reception desk. So, when they called token 1-7, I dutifully reported to the reception desk. They checked my passport, signed in a few places, and sent me upstairs to the Scrutiny Desk. Once upstairs, the masses were split by visa type: students, researched, etc. in one ""line"", and those on an employment visa in another ""line"". Now, before you get all excited and quietly accuse me of misusing quotes here, let me assure you that they are 100%!w(MISSING)arranted; for, once upstairs, all semblance of process disappeared: the employees refused to speak to the helpless foreigners, and all of us knew that we were now in the Wild Wild West. But, I must admit, to our credit, we followed what we believed to be the law of the land; we compared tokens, claimed a corner of the room, and set ourselves up in order. Several numbers were missing in the middle (they were in the student visa line), but we managed to get ourselves in an orderly, seated line. I have no idea how many people were in front of me, but I know it was less than sixteen. Things weren't all that bad (yet).

For no less than an hour, I sat, happily, playing sudoku, reading Rachel Maddow, and playing solitaire. Once it was my turn, a lady and a gentleman, in succession, shamelessly hopped in front of me and handed in their papers. I did not see tokens in their hands, and so I looked to my clueless friends in line with me who, in response to my bewildered look, shrugged their shoulders. Those doing the scrutinizing behind their desks didn't think anything of the line cutters, so I went back to my games. After the cutters were finished, it was my turn. My scrutinizer didn't say a word to me, which I assumed was a good thing. After fifteen minutes of watching him flip through my papers and sign things, I was finished! Time to go home, right?

Nope! Time to go to the authenticator. So I queued up behind a line of one (score!) and was authenticated in about five minutes. Where to now? The signature line, of course! I was directed by my pearl of an authenticator to the ""cabin"", about ten yards to my left. Once in the cabin, my documents were signed by the fourth person... but this time, with a fancy blue pen. Certainly this was the last step! Four reviewers and a signature with a fancy blue pen. What else could there be?

Some may call it judgement. Some may call it torture. I haven't quite found the word for it, but let's just say I think I have a pretty good idea of how Jesus felt for those 40 days in the desert. It was time for Counter 4.

What could I possibly be talking about? What could have been that bad? Well, let me start by saying that the woman staffing Counter 4 would have been well suited for the Third Reich. She was hands down the most sadistic person I have encountered during my time here (even more so than that dumb fuck rickshaw rickshaw driver who dropped me in the middle of nowhere yesterday ). As I sat in the chair, facing her, I was ignored for twenty minutes; imagine facing your judge and they could not even bother to acknowledge that you were a fellow Homosapien. No one else existed in the world except for the two of us, but it was her world. I sat there, sweaty browed, anxiously waiting for either a directive or the end of days. To my relief, I received a directive. Granted, it was in the form of a grunt that was in no discernible language and an outstretched hand that I assumed meant she was ready for my paperwork. Since she could not be bothered to lean forward over her bloated belly to accept my paperwork, I had to maneuver through the 12""x12"" square in the glass to deliver my papers right to her hands (picture Princess Leia feeding Jabba). We repeated our dance once more as she petitioned, again in her own cute way, for my passport. Sadly, after chatting with her friends in what I can only assume was Kannada and without even hinting at providing any sort of service, she handed me back my passport and our adventure together thus ended. She gave me the ol' stamp of approval, and I was released.... for 2.5 hours while they ""processed"" my documents (Again, quotes warranted. I'm pretty sure this was another one of their Gestapo tactics). Which brings us back to the coffee shop, where I sit, eating this God-awful donut and typing on my Kindle Fire. In a perfect world, I'd have been lost in this entry and 2.5 hours would have fit in the last fifteen I spent writing this. But, alas, this world is far from perfect.

So, I will leave you with a closing thought: I would rather spend my next TEN birthdays at the DMV than ever have to step foot into an FRRO again. Yes, it's that bad.



Cheers folks,

TR



Appending note: today wasn't all bad; my visit to the FRRO gave me license to dress casually and consequently show up to the office looking like Richard Engel. It doesn't even the score, but it is a small victory, and I will take what I can get.

Eventually there will be a day when nothing really out of the ordinary happens and I'll have to resort to summarizing little things that I've noticed here and there but haven't really been able to fit into any other post.

Today is not that day.

The first half of the day was pretty normal. Exact same breakfast buffet as described earlier (except I tried watermelon juice). Lectures weren't excessively noteworthy except for the fact that our second lecturer ran 40 minutes over because he had gotten the wrong stopping time. I got to unicycle during lunch, yay! My hand pump to inflate Tweaker broke while I was trying to inflate the tire--not surprising since I paid only $2 for it plus shipping--but Keshav's friend had an air compressor in his car so I was soon tooling around near the courtyard. I think I'll be able to work on some flatland there, which is good since I can't do any flatland tricks (yet).

What made the day awesome, however, was that our last lecture of the day was cancelled. Not only did this mean that we were freed of a 90-minute lecture, but that Fae, Sam, Naveet, Sumedha and myself were able to go shopping for saris. So off we headed to Commercial Street, via auto of course, to see what fun stuff we could buy.

We wandered into a jewlelry shop first, allured by the sparkles and shinies. I tried on a cool pair of turquoise earrings that loop over the shell over your ear and dangle down the back, and Fae tried on a jewled headpiece. I was surprised that we could just take the earrings off the wall of the shop and try them on and put them back, since that would be considered unsanitary in the states and the stores wouldn't allow that. We then remembered that we needed the saris before we could accessorize, so we wandered down the street until we found a shop that looked promising.

The shop was full of women, so you know that it is a popular place to buy clothes. There were bright red signs everywhere ""Buy 1 Get 1 Free"" and ""50% Off,"" but also ones that blared ""Beware of pickpocketers."" I kept my purse on my hip, where I could see it, and laid a hand on top to be doubly-sure. I was carrying enough to money to buy a sari (about 5000 Rs) and the last thing I wanted was to lose that. Especially since I had borrowed 2000 of them from Sam since I didn't have enough cash on me.

We looked at saris there, but nothing really caught Fae's or Sam's attention and I had no clue what I was doing, since my head was in the clouds. Both literally and metaphorically. I am taller than all the women in India, at least all that I've seen, and a large majority of the men. But I guess that's true in America too. But I digress. Saris are long rectangles of cloth that you wrap around you in such a way that you feel like a princess or a goddess come down to grace the poor earthlings with your presence. They were folded and stacked on shelves behind a large counter. You walk up to the counter and skim, looking for one you like, then point and ask an employee to lay it out on the counter. You can then examine it and see if you like the pattern. In that first shop we went to they catered more to the everyday people, so you didn't get to try on the sari. We wandered to the back of the shop to look at kurtis, which are Indian tunics that can be worn over leggings or jeans. I found two that I liked for 324 Rs each (under $6) and bought those. I wanted to buy a pair of leggings there to go with, but they didn't have a good color.

Once we finally got out of that shop (we all kept looking at kurtis) we wandered down the street again until we saw another sari shop. This one obviously was not just for everyday saris as it was completely empty when we came up. In this place the saris were hung on hangars instead of folded on shelves. One sari immediately caught my eye, a turquoise with silver dots and maroon trim. The shop owner told us we could only try on a sari if we were likely to buy it, so after dithering for a bit I asked him to try it on. First he wrapped a loop around my waist and then pinned it to itself to keep it up. Then a large length of it is accordian-folded to make extra fabric in front that swishes and flicks while you walk and makes you feel glorious. Finally, the length that is left is brought up over the left shoulder to round off the goddess look. I can't wait to wear mine for reals.

The sari itself set me back 1690 Rs (~$30) but I still needed to buy an underskirt (called a petticoat) and a blouse. It turns out that the sari fabric came with extra fabric that they use to make a blouse, assuming you find a tailor. At the time I figured it'd be easier to just buy a blouse ready-made, so once I'd purchased my lovely new sari we continued down the road to find Sam and Fae something, since they hadn't found anything yet. Fae was looking for something very similar to a sari she'd tried on the day before the program started, but with a smaller pricetag, and Sam just hadn't seen anything she liked.

The next shop we wandered into because they sold petticoats, which I needed for my sari. Since the sari is sheer the petticoat is supposed to match exactly, but they didn't have a shade that matched so I just went for a sort of forest green that would work under the fabric (cost: 195 Rs = $3.50). They sold leggings, too, and I found a pair that would work with my kurtis but when they named a price of 350 Rs I laughed and walked out. I know nothing about shopping, especialy in India, and even I knew that was ridiculous!

Our next shop ended up being out last sari shop. Called WoW!, which stood for World of Women, it sat on a neon-lit street packed with nicer shops. The saris were folded and on shelves, like the first shop, except that they were stored in plastic packets to keep them neat. The overall feeling of the shop was more high-end than that of the second, and way more high-end than that of the first. After viewing several saris, Sam decided to try on a golden yellow one that ended up looking GORGEOUS on her. Fae was still comparing everything to the one she had tried on a couple days ago, but she pulled out a red one and a magenta one to try. I was interested to see that in this shop the lady helping Fae with her saris offered her opinion on the choice of fabric color, and I was happy that my opinions coincided with hers in terms of color choice. Fae ended up buying the red one, but both looked wonderful, and hers and Sam's saris ended up both costing around 3000 Rs each (~$53). The shop had a tailor who worked nearby come over to arranged making the blouses out of the extra sari fabric, so I ended up just adding my sari to their order, which is how I'm getting a tailored blouse.

After Naveet and Sumedha haggled with the tailor to get us a better deal, the tailor led us to his shop about two blocks away that was tucked into a sketchy back alley that made us a bit nervous when he first led us down. The shop was about 10"" deep and 6"" wide, with four men crammed in over sewing machines. The tailor and another man talked to us over the counter in the front, took our measurements, and asked whether we wanted hooks in the front or zippers under the arm. Sam and Fae chose the zippers, but I thought that might get scratchy if your arm rubs it so I went for the hooks instead. They also offered to hem my sari properly for 75 Rs so I threw that into the bargain. Then we realized we wanted to wear these to the banquet tomorrow night so Naveet and Sumedha had to heckle to get him to finish them on time. When he finally acceeded I was surprised--wouldn't it cost extra to get a rush job? Sure enough, when the bill came he had added extra charges and the two Indian girls had to heckle (again) to get him to drop the price a bit.

With that business completed we decided to find some grub. We quickly stopped in a last shop to buy leggings for me, and Sam tried on some wickedly ridiculous harem pants that looked like they were made for the circus. When we found an auto he told us he'd take us anywhere close for free, as long as we'd go to a shop afterwards for only 5 minutes. Apparently the shop had a deal with the auto driver that if he got people to go to the shop for 5 minutes they'd give him a coupon for 100 Rs and a t-shirt. Well, who's to turn down a free ride to dinner? Especially when he'll wait while we eat then drive us back to the hotel after we visit the shop.

So we went to a super-tasty, super-cheap restaurant in the Kamat Hotel (I think. I didn't write the name down, which is a pity.). We ordered three curry dishes--paneer tikka masal, abu gobi, and malai kopta--for around 100 Rs each ($2), a plain rice dish for 20 Rs ($0.40), and roti (which is basically pita) for less than 100 Rs ($2). I ate first with a spoon, then with roti, and finally fingers. As it turns out, you're allowed to mix your curry and rice together with your fingers and scoop it into your mouth with your hands. When I saw Sumedha eating like that I immediately wanted to try. It's like finger painting, but with food! We also had sauf at the end of the meal, which is a collection of seeds that you and eat as a breath freshener. Tasted a bit like licorice.

Before we could head back we had to head to the auto driver's contract shop. Turns out it sold a variety of Indian goods, like scarves, sandalwood, incense, jewellry, knickknacks and trinkets. I didn't buy anything, since I was shopped out and also hadn't figured out what souveniers I wanted to get for what people, but Fae bought a cool scarf and Naveet and Sumedha bought gems for themselves and their fiancees. Something really funny happened in the shop: I kept looking at a variety of trinkets as possible souveniers for people but with no intention to buy. One of the workers was shadowing me and anytime I expressed interest in something he'd rattle off words about how good it was, etc. And then I'd ask for the price, he'd tell me, and I'd say ""thanks"" and walk away. When we were in the jewellry room he showed me a box of bracelets and said 300-400 Rs. Of course I wasn't interested, but what was funny happened later. As we were just trying to leave the jewellry seller roped Fae into trying on a bracelet from the same box. His price to her for the bracelet? 600 Rs! So I guess it's worthwhile to not be interested in anything for a bit, then take them by surprise. :D

We had a scare on our auto ride home. Just after we had left the curio shop I thought our auto driver was acting strangely, driving slowly and waiting for the other auto with Sumedha, Fae, and Sam to catch up, then following slowly. A bit later both autos turn down a side street, then down a steep ramp into the parking garage of some building, where they parked and turned off their motors. I was a bit nervous because Naveet was a bit nervous and she was asking the driver to ""just take us to our hotel."" I ducked my head to see out the auto better and saw two men nearby standing next to an elevator. So that made four men, vs. us five girls. I was figuring if I should get ready to bolt when one of the men went to the first auto, handed a business card, then came to our auto and gave me a business card. Turns out these guys just worked for a silk seller and their method of getting business was for shopping foreigners (and perhaps Indians as well) to make an unscheduled stop. After we vehemently expressed a lack of interest, our auto drivers took us back to our hotel like good little boys.

We tried on our clothes in Naveet and Sumedha's room; turns out one of the kurtis I bought was too small and one of Fae's was too big, so we switched. My other was also too small, but we're taking it to the tailor tomorrow when we get our saris back and I'm getting strips put in the side to make it a bit wider. I'm also going to have him make the armholes in the other kurti bigger. My biceps are just too buff, you know? All that iron I pump all the time. ;D

This post might be a bit shorter than the others as I am pretty tired and my A/C has decided to go on the fritz. I talked to the front desk and they sent someone up, but unfortunately he and I couldn't communicate. It's terribly frustrating, since I was talking to some of the guys from India on the bus perfectly fine, yet I just couldn't grasp the what this man was trying to say. He did say something about it being cool for 5 minutes, or something, but i just could not understand what he wanted from me. And I think he was frustrated that I didn't understand him. So I have no idea if/when they'll fix my A/C. 😞

The day started out a bit earlier than I expected: my 7:30am wake-up call came at 6:40am. Fae said this happened to her as well, so we're not sure what went wrong. It's kind of a common theme here. Well, not things going wrong, exactly. It's a bit hard to explain. To me it feels like everything here is on the verge of falling into total chaos, but things are barely held together by metaphysical tape and the chaos only shows through now and then. Like my bag being lost, and eventually delivered, but damaged. Or dealing with auto drivers (I asked the Indian guys, and that's the way to refer to auto-rickshaws in short). Or getting things fixed, like my A/C. It won't necessarily happen quickly, and I suspect there's no way to know when it will be fixed. It's a different feeling from the states, where everything is very regulated and controlled. You know when you get your food, when the repair-man is coming, when your wake-up call is coming, etc., and if something goes wrong it's cause to complain vigorously. I suppose you could complain for the same things here, too, but it would get you nowhere. Lucky for me I'm pretty easygoing so this is all part of the fun.

The buffet breakfast was the same as yesterday, except that the dubious french toast was replaced with pancakes. Which actually looked like pancakes and tasted similar to pancakes. Oh! And there was fresh-made grape juice, which I've never had before. IT IS DELICIOUS. I wanted to steal the whole pitcher.

I had to bring my duffel back to IISc today because a friend of Keshav (an awesome guy who's been doing a lot of behind-the-scenes work with the program) said he could get my bag repaired. This meant that I had to lug both the bag and Tweaker onto the bus, which was less than stellar. I tried to ride Tweaker during the lunch break, but I didn't inflate the tire nearly enough and had a huge problem just riding straight. Hopefully I'll do better tomorrow with more air. I'm not sure if practicing on the street where I was will work, since it's still driven on occassionally but I'm going to keep trying. Perhaps a bit of exploring will lead me to a spot that will work.

My favorite part of the day was a cultural lecture we had in place of our fourth professor lecture. A lady gave a presentation on the art of Rangoli, which I had no clue existed before she told us about it. Rangoli is artwork that household women do on the pavement between the gate and the house every morning. Mrs. Pradash (I don't think that is her name but I have to call her something...) said that it's one of the first things women do in the morning. After waking up and perhaps boiling mint, she heads out to sweep the front yard, then cleans it with water and cow dung (since cows are sacred this serves as cleansing and purification), then create the Rangoli design in some sort of powder on the ground. Mrs. Pradash also talked about making Rangoli designs on a completly full, completely settled container of water, but I think the design on the ground is the most common. The designs are done every day, unless something terrible has befallen the family such as a death or serious illness. It's even a bit of competition among the different households, who can have the prettiest Rangoli. Kind of like husbands and yards back home.

The name Rangoli comes from the Sanskrit word ""Rangavalli"" which is a joinging of the words for color (ranga) and rows of color (avalli). The designs are often inspired by nature, and they are meant to block the negative energy outside of the house and only let in the positive energy. For you nerds out there I think of it as a ""good-pass filter."" :D The story she told us about the history of Rangoli is that a high priest of a long-ago king lost a son, and the king drew an image of the boy and asked Brahma, the god of creation, to bring life to the drawing. In addition to the front yard, Rangolis can also be found in the pooja room (the room where the gods reside) in the house. There are also Rangolis for festivals, different ones for each festival, and the festival begins with Rangoli.

Rangoli can be made with a variety of materials and a veriaty of patterns. The designs made of powder can be made of rice powder, crushed colored chalk, crushed limestone, or even crushed brick for red. Mrs. Pradash showed us pictures of Rangolis made in flowers, from the petals of flowers like crysanthemums and marigolds, and she had several designs she had made out of things like beads, plastics, glass fragments, or fabric. She'd even made a Rangoli pattern on a coaster with puff paints. When I asked to see it at the end of the talk, she told me I could keep it. It's sitting next to my bed, now, to give me good dreams! My favorite style of Rangoli was not the really elaborate patterns, like the peacocks and sunsets, but the geometrical dot and line Rangoli. To see the difference between the elaborate and the geometrical, trying google-imaging ""rangoli"" and then ""dot rangoli"" and you'll see what I mean. She even gave us pencil and paper and had us draw the most basic dot Rangoli. I couldn't get my proportions right but I had a lot of fun. 😞

Rangoli is traditionally done by hand, but Mrs. Pradash showed us several gadgets that are available to help women make their Rangoli faster since they may have more responsibilities now that just staying at home. One was a tin cylinder with holes punched in a pattern; you filled the cylinder with sand then rolled it over the ground, leaving a line pattern. Another was a container with four holes that you filled with sand to help you draw parallel lines. She even showed us Rangoli stickers, for the truly busy.

After the lecture we hopped back on the bus and came back here to the hotel. I didn't eat my wrap from lunch, so that is going to be my dinner. Not only does that mean I get to earn a bit of money off my per diem, it means I get to just stay in my room and veg out tonight. I'm pretty excited. What's even better is that as I was writing this post I had a couple times where the electricity in my room went out. I think it was a black out--apparently they are common here, along with brown outs and grey outs--since my internet bugged out at that time, but the best thing is that my A/C is working now! Yay! And I see that my post is just as long as my previous ones, so I guess I muscled through this one just fine. 😊 Until next time!

errrrr
Bonjour mes amis,

I'm going to attempt to fit about a week's worth of adventure into one entry (Wednesday 7/11-Thursday 7/19). Since work has started I've been a bit burnt out... My schedule has been irregular because of a long Friday night and several early work mornings. Here's my attempt at relaying nine days worth of events:

Let me start with some advice I received from my boss before I left: to state the obvious, being gay in India is not like being gay in NYC (duh). I was told, essentially, to leave out some key details of my personal life so as not to let the proverbial cat out of the bag. This advice was given from the heart; my boss wanted to ensure that my work would be judged on its merits and not by what my teammates perceived my character to be because of my sexual orientation. I took this advice very seriously; I want this exercise to be as smooth as possible.

Now, as you may or may not know, for the first eighteen years of my life, it was regular practice for me to leave out key details of my personal life to keep that rambunctious cat in that tiny, shrinking and ever-less efficacious bag. But after being out for six years, and building a life based on being out, this advice was more easily received than executed. My first night out with my team (which kept me at a house party until 4:30 am) was filled with a ton of awkward advice from my colleagues... Apparently, my hair, glasses, and socks all point to homo in the eyes of twenty-something Indians (and probably most twenty-somethings around the world). So, after a few drinks, a few were comfortable enough to spill the beans: for sure, American style is different than Indian style; but for God's sake, I'd better be more careful, else folks might think I'm actually gay! But, not to worry, they can tell me how to avoid that. The key to success in this endeavor, I was told, was to never, under any circumstances, wear pink socks (really?). That, mes amis, is the dead giveaway (insert traumatized emoticon here). So... what did I do in response you ask? I evaded their questions on girls, graciously acknowledged their advice, and wore pink socks on Monday. Yee-haw!

Ok, so that was Friday. I'm going to skip over Saturday and Sunday for the most part. Highlights: I slept until 6pm Saturday evening (which ruined my schedule) did a very NY lounge with other folks in my program, Amy, Hannah, and Jennifer (these are not their real names; they asked for pseudonyms in the blog), and did brunch with the same group on Sunday.



Do you feel rested after the weekend recap? I hope so, for more, yes more, drama is on its way.

Let me continue with my journey for passport photos, and my SP rickshaw driver who went rogue on my ass. At the suggestion of a friend, I went to a shop a few blocks away for photos I would need for FRRO registration (see: Papers Please). Getting a rickshaw there was relatively easy, and the driver was a very pleasant man. An old lady even helped him with directions, unsolicited! I tried to pay him to wait for me outside the shop, but he was too busy (doing what, not sure). So I tipped him for his troubles and we went out separate ways. Feeling confident from that interaction I pressed on to get my photos. I accomplished as much without a hitch (other than looking awkward in my photo). Ay, but the hitch was yet to come. On my return trip, feeling that the universe was on my side from the tip I gave my last driver, I was confident that getting home would be as easy. Silly me.

After fighting with my first two rickshaw drivers because they were trying to fleece me, I settled on the third, who was charging just as ridiculous a rate (30 rps ); if they were going to steal from me, at least they were all stealing at the market rate. Most rickshaw drivers don't speak English, have probably never passed a driving test, and certainly don't know where they are going. This poses a bit of a logistical issue for someone not familiar with the city. Long story short, the motherfucker dropped me off about three blocks away from my hotel and did it with attitude. If I were in any Western city, navigating those three blocks may not have been a challenge... But getting around in a 12th Century city with 18th Century infrastructure and 20th Century automobiles and 10 people per square foot is a bit of a task. Thank God I had emailed myself a map cut out of a 10 block radius around my hotel. By the time I found a road sign and mapped myself a route, what should have been a three minute walk turned into a twenty minute adventure. I wasn't so much scared while I was walking around, half aimlessly, half intentionally; I was more so frustrated. It's tough when you lose at a game that you still don't know the rules of.

To wrap up: that same day my expat security briefing was scheduled with the head of security for Asia. His main points: taking rickshaws is dangerous and dumb (everyone ignores this advice; if only I had gotten it before Sarah Palin dropped me off on the wrong block), tens of thousands of people die every year on Bangalore's roads due to automobile related accidents, and if I am not careful, I will wind up getting hit by a car, laughed at by locals, washed into a storm drain by a monsoon, and left to die. Apparently this man has even more of a flare for dramatics than yours truly, but that is his job.

If that last paragraph made you anxious, rest easy; I practice all the safety precautions, and the firm has a strong presence in the city. If anything goes wrong, they'll have my airlifted, or whatever. I'll be fine!

Until next time,

TR

July 23rd 2012

Today was another solid day in my Bangalore trip. It started out quite early, around 4:30am or so, because my body still hasn't quite adjusted and decided that it had had enough sleep, thank you very much. I actually wasn't tired because my brain had gotten into the habit of sinking straight into deep REM the instant I fell asleep (thanks to excessive sleep dep.) so even though I only slept for less than 5 hours I was awake. Around 4:40 or so the islamic prayer came over the outside loudspeakers--a man's voice in a wailing, ululating cry that echoed a bit eerily around outside. Not that I really heard it over the howling dogs. Yes, that's right. People who have been here for a couple days inform me that every morning around that time the prayer comes on and the dogs howl with the singing. Right now I find it hilarious. In a couple days, I will probably hate it. In a couple weeks I may be able to sleep through it!

Breakfast was served on the fourth-floor Kebab restaurant, buffet-style. There was a large variety of food and, of course, I tried to eat as much of it as I could. I had a pinwheel-shaped baked good, a slice of white bread studded with candied fruits, some sort of cold noodles, ""french toast"" (more like flatbread with a thin coating of egg), vada with sauce (savory fritter with chives shaped like a donut), idly (pronounced ""id-lie"" it's this kind of salty sponge-like cake-thing made of rice and lentils) with coconut chutney, a brown-style omelette with no cheese and some chives and tomatos in the egg, a boiled egg, and, last but not least, I tried my first cup of tea. I'm not sure what kind it is specifically, I asked our Indian friends and they just said it's tea, but it's served with milk and adding two lumps of sugar made it delicious. It almost tastes like they added cocoa to it, but I don't think they did.

After breakfast we piled into the bus to travel to the Institute of Science's campus. Day 2 and I'm already getting used to the driving methods here. It's rather strange, but the rules make a lot of sense to me. It reminds me of swarming ants and large flocks of birds. On the surface it looks like chaos, but when you get down to it there's no collisions between people. It's just like cooperative control and rigid formations. Then again we were in a large bus and people had to navigate around us. Things were still sketchy when viewed from the back of an auto-rickshaw (details below).

The schedule today dictates what almost every day is going to be like for us for the next week and a half: two lectures in the morning, with a break for tea, then lunch, then two lectures in the afternoon, with a break for tea, then a bus back to the hotel where we scrounge our own dinner. The teas and lunch were served in a small courtyard right next to the lecture room. A small courtyard that was also inhabited by...monkeys. Patrick and I had had a conversation earlier in the trip about how we'd both heard we weren't supposed to touch dogs, cats, or monkeys since there is a large rabies epidemic here. We'd laughed at the last. I mean, really, what were the chances we'd be anywhere near monkeys? Turns out, pretty high. These monkeys looked similar to Jack the monkey from Pirates of the Carribean, except they were a bit bigger on average, about the size of cats, and were all grey. The alpha male was the biggest of all, maybe about the size of a medium-small dog. All of them had tufts of hair that made them look like they were wearing toupees.

The lectures today were really good, all topics that I am familiar with and like. The first was an overview of structural dynamics, then wireless sensing and digital signals processing, then experimental modal analysis and finally system identification. I really wanted to pay attention in the last lecture, as he was discussing the theory behind wavelets and some system ID techniques I didn't know, but jet lag hit me hard and it was all I could do to keep from literally passing out. At one point I fell asleep and did a head-bob, with my eyes wide open and staring at the screen. It did not help that my bag had been delivered and all I wanted to do was shower, brush my teeth, and change my clothes.

That's right, my bag was delivered today! Some of the program guys have been really awesome in keeping in touch with the baggage people, so they delivered the bag to me at the lecture hall and I got to sign for it and regain posession of my bag right then and there. Unfortunately the bag did not come through unscathed. There's a zippered panel on the bottom side that hides some backpack straps, and somehow that zipper was torn completely off the bag. The plastic handle on the bottom side is also broken. But the program guys are so awesome, they've told me to bring the bag tomorrow and they'll get the zipper fixed. I think the handle's out of commission, though, but I don't use that one so it's okay. But this is a good lesson for travelers to India: be prepared for damage to your baggage, and possibly the contents within. Especially bags like mine, which have several straps and buckles hanging off it.

My best adventure for the day commenced after returning to the hotel, showering, and changing into some new clothes (FINALLY). The title? AUTO-RICKSHAW DINNER ADVENTURE! A group from the American contingent (Reggie, Samantha (Sam), Fae, Patrick, Chungzhao, myself, and Jim) and Nick (the Swede attending a university in Japan) decided to go out to dinner to a restaurant called Oye! Amritsar based on Sam's Lonely Planet book. Of course, to get there we would need to be driven, and what better way to get around the streets of Bangalore than in the wonderfully comfortable, uber-safe backseat of an auto-rickshaw? So we split up into smaller groups (I rode with Nick and Sam, all the blonds in one rickshaw!) and all found ourselves some rickshaws. Jim, Sam, and Fae had all taken an auto-rickshaw around yesterday so they knew how to go about it properly. Here's what I've learned based on our experience:


• They are wicked fun and exhilirating to ride in.
• Stop panicking. The driver knows what he's doing and you'll be fine. Probably. Even if he pulls a u-turn into and through a line of oncoming, full-speed traffic. We kinda thought we were gonna die on that one.
• Write down where you want to go, show it to them, and ask them if they can take you there. I'm not positive, but it seems the drivers are honest enough to tell you if they don't know where it is or if they can't even get you close. If there's another driver near they may flag him down for you. Be aware that if they don't know exactly where it is they may just drop you near and you'll have to hoof it and possibly ask for directions along the way.
• MAKE HIM TURN ON THE METER. Once you've ascertained that he can get you where/near where you want to go, tell him to turn on the meter. If he hems and haws, say ""meter or nothing."" If he still refuses to turn on the meter, find a different driver. If you don't do this, and don't agree on a price beforehand he will rob you blind. If you agree on a price beforehand he may just up the price midway because he can. This happened to Jim, Fae and Sam, and Jim threw a fit but they still paid. In my personal opinion, if this happens to you, just pretend to grumble but have the bills for the original agreed fare in your hands. Then when he drops you off, hand over the bills and walk away. He tried to cheat you, might as well cheat a bit back. But really, best way is to just turn on the meter.
• Enjoy the experience. There's nothing like it.
• Sometimes you can get away with paying a few Rs less than the agreed price, but only if it's 2 Rs, none of you have 2 Rs and another customer comes along and the driver needs to go. Then he'll curl his hand into a fist, face down, then sweep his fingers down and towards you and say ""take it and go"" like he's disgusted with you. But you keep your rupees!


Our driver dropped us off on some corner and pointed in some direction and said something unintelligible. We wandered down the street in the direction he had pointed, asked for some directions and eventually found the others in our group who had been dropped off closer to the restaurant. Unfortunately, it had closed down between the publication of the book and tonight. So instead we dropped into a restaurant we had seen while walking down the street, one who's name I had recognized as also being in the Lonely Planet book--the Coconut Grove.

The place was cool, dark-wood and lamp ambiance with northern Indian-style food. When I ordered the ""chettinad button mushroom"" (chettinad is a region of india) the waiter graciously warned me that it was spicy. I then added a side of naan, and at the waiter's and Fae's suggestion (Fae is Iranian and so has experience eating similar cuisine) added in a side of curd (basically yogurt) to tame the capsaicin. Everyone got a ""plate,"" a 14"" metal circle with 2"" sides as the rim, with some sort of large leaf inside. Our dishes were then brought to the side of the plate, and you spooned stuff onto the plate and ate it from there.

The button mushroom was, indeed, spicy, but not unbearably so. It was a very thick gravy, laden with spices, with hunks of mushrooms floating around to make you feel all happy inside. The naan helped a little (mostly it was just tasty), Sam gave me some of her rice which helped too and made it even tastier, and the yogurt helped a lot. I'm very glad Fae and the waiter told me to get it or my stomach would have been extremely unhappy with me. The naan was a style I haven't seen yet--this time it was similar to a tortilla that has had lots of slits put it in it so it looks kind of like something a goth might wear, except it wasn't black. I finished off my meal with a ""mango waltz""--mango and vanilla ice cream with pieces of mango.

The ride back was relatively uneventful, but I really liked our driver this time. He made no fuss about turning on the meter, had mostly intelligible English, and asked us about what we were doing in Bangalore, how we liked it, etc. I even forgave him for trying to wheedle extra money out of us when we got to the hotel. I then finished unpacking, assembled Tweaker, hung out with Fae and Sam for awhile, then started blogging. It is now WAY past my bedtime, so I'm signing off!

July 22nd 2012
Published: July 22nd 2012


The weather when we arrived in Bangalore was beautiful, perfectly cool and perfectly humid. We had some drivers to chauffeur us from the airport to our hotel in Ganga Nagar. THANK GOODNESS. I'll explain why in a bit. The vehicle of choice was a van similar in style to a VW minibus, but with a bit more headroom and squishy seats that could seat 10 people comfortably. We six participants piled in the back to peer out the curtained windows, our guides hopped in the front and we were off on our road adventure.

And what an adventure it was. Anyone who has traveled to India knows: the traffic there operates on completely different rules than it does in the states. The white lines mean basically nothing. You drive in a mostly-straight line, use your horn often to let people know where you are, and stay on the left side of the road, but beyond that there are few rules to follow. Well, don't hit other cars/motorcycles, I guess. Oh, and the cows. Don't hit the cows. Because since they are sacred they wander the roads.

So for most of our 40-minute drive to Ganganagar I was staring as the variety of motorbikes, cars (some colorful and outlandish, some normal) that were often only literally inches from my nose. There were many buses, almost always full to the brim. One bus had a boy who was hanging out an open door as it drove along; when we stopped temporarily he hopped out and jogged around before jumping back onto the moving bus. Some men pee when they need to go and can find a wall. Almost no one wore shorts or anything above the knee. Most women wore saris or tunic and pants, but there were a few that wore jeans and t-shirts. Only once did I see a pair of shoulders, and those on a young boy working construction. Stray dogs roam the streets, and there are people everywhere. All the time. On the roads, by the roads, near the roads, walking, biking, chatting, laughing, sitting, anything, but there are people and there are a lot.

I like our hotel, though it is not very luxurious by American standards. I can hear the prayers over the speakers outside, which I like. I lucked out and got a room to myself on the second floor with some nice natural lighting and a comfy bed. To get the lights to work and the A/C to turn on, you have to stick your room key in a slot by the door. I didn't know this and when I first got here I went downstairs and told them my lights didn't work. They were so gracious, after asking me if I had put my key in the slot (duh) they actually sent someone up to show me how to do it. So now I know: some hotels have key-slots to activate the room's electricity. My largest snafu today came when my room phone rang (which is, incidentally, in the bathroom. Not sure why.) and I answered it to hear a man say, ""housekeeping."" ""Okay."" I said, then waited. Did they have a message for me? After a period of awkward silence it became apparent that they wanted something from me. Unfortunately I didn't know what they wanted. So we ended up having an awkward conversation where I almost hung up, or was silent, and so did he, and then I did hang up and went outside my room to talk to them since they were right there. I told them I didn't understand what they had wanted. In my defense, how could I? They hadn't actually asked me for anything. Well, we ended up not really communicating and he and his buddy smiled that awkward smile Indian people give you when you're not communicating well or you've done something wrong and they feel uncomfortable. Turns out I think they were seing if I had anything to launder, so next time I guess I should say ""I don't need anything, thanks.""

In the afternoon Reggie, Patrick and I walked around our street a bit to get a bite. We visited a KFC and a Domino's, and the boys chose Domino's (I wasn't eating). It was on the second story, which meant I was able to watch the busy street, and dogs and cows, while we waited. Afterwards I made them visit an alleyway I had scoped out as a possible unicycling location. That's going to be difficult, unicyclig here, because there aren't parking lots like I'm used to. I need large, relatively flat ground, where I won't get run over by speeding autorickshaws, and I might not get that here. Anyway, turns out the alleyway led to a pretty cool graveyard back behind the houses. Maybe I won't practice there.

Dinner is what has really made today fantastic. The dinner tonight was a reception with all of the Asia-Pacific School in Smart Structures students, which includes people from universities in Japan, China, Korea, U.S. and India. We started with a toast of Kingfisher beer, then everyone had to introduce themselves individually during this time. Of course, with 50 participants this took a large amount of time. This was happening on the top floor of our hotel, on a terrace which had some 6' walls that were stone on bottom half, glass up top, that looked over the city, and in particular down onto the roof terrace of the next building owner. I was leaned up against this wall, my back to the building, but at some point during the talktalk I turned around and was an Indian girl on the roof, watching this large group of foreigners right next door. She was wearing the tunic and leggings that you see in place of saris on some women, and a veil, all brightly colored, so I spotted her right off, grinned, and waved. She smiled and waved back and I turned back around to pay attention. Later on I peeked again to see if she was still there and saw that she had a friend with her now, and when they saw me look at them they collapsed into giggles and lash-fluttering. And that's when it hit me.

They were flirting with me. With my hair braided back, my male-styled tank and my guy's button-up t-shirt on top, they thought I was some blond foreigner flirting with them. I almost collapsed into giggles right then, it was so ridiculous. I did turn back to the room and tried not to attract their attention anymore but the damage was done. I have flirted with Indian girls. What's worse, I think they were only around 14 or so. I was definitely embarassed, when I realized what was going on, but the humor of the situation was not beyond me. When we broke from the terrace to sit down to eat I pulled Reggie and Patrick over to wave at them too, just for fun.

Dinner was one of the most amazing meals of my life. We sat and had plates in front of us, and waiters kepts coming around and offering bits of this, bits of that, whatever they had. Anytime they offered me something I just smiled and said ""yes, please"" regardless of what it was. I had potatoes, chicken, prawns, baby corn, tofu, fruit, veggies, and more, all cooked in an Indian kebab-style. I was getting a little full from the delicious food when I listened to someone talking next to me and realized that these were only the appetizers. There was a buffet next door with even more delicious food. I had veggie rice, egg-fried rice, dal (a tasty mush made of lentils), some lamb -in-mystery-sauce, some chicken-in-mystery-sauce. I piled the sauce-foods on the rice-foods on my plate and took it back to my seat. Then waiters brought around dosa and naan, two types of flatbreads. Dosa has a consistency that reminds me of steamed buns and naan is like pita, but not really.

I'm happy of how I ate tonight because I think I ate this food in a proper indian manner. The left hand stayed strictly in my lap and did not come anywhere near my food. I used my right hand to tear of bits of the naan or dosa, then laid those bits over the sauce-and-rice-and-meat and pinched the edges together to get a nice packet of flatbread-and-delicious. As I ate I conversed a lot with some Indian professors near me and I tried to learn more about Indian culture, what to expect, what to eat, how to eat, and much more.

The meal was concluded with the waiters handing around two bits of leaves wrapped up like a packet on a toothpick. I, unfortunately, thought it was more food and popped one into my mouth before finishing my ice cream. This matters because it was paan, an after-meal item meant to help digestion. The flavor is really strange. There's no way I can describe it, though I can describe the consistency. It's like chewing a leaf. Well, that's because it is a leaf. Kind of a thicker one, though, like a palm frond. What was really strange, besides the taste, was that I felt it doing something to my stomach. Kind of like when I eat mint and I can feel it in my stomach. The taste was so overpowering at first I found it a bit nauseating. The other kids that tried it definitely did not enjoy it either; it was hilarious to watch unwitting students pop one into their mouth and then make a really strange face. I tried to eat the first one fast so I could finish my ice cream, but didn't really enjoy it. I tried the second one, despite the first one being less-than-stellar, more out of trying to outdo the people around me than anything else. That's when I realized it's not meant to be chewed and eaten, paan is meant to be chewed and sucked on. It's not the leaves that are useful, it's the juices. And sure enough, the juices mae my stomach feel nice, though not if I had too much at once. Fun learning experience of the day.

After that we chatted with some of the students from other countries, and then I headed off to my room to write these first two entries. I figured I better stay up and do this now--if I keep having so many new experiences every day I can't afford to fall behind on writing them down!

July 22nd 2012
Published: July 22nd 2012


Whew! So much has happened already on this trip to Bangalore (or Bengaluru if you prefer) that I've decided to write a blog about it. This way my mom can keep careful track of me, my friends can see what hijinks I get up to, and maybe other people can benefit from the experiences I had traveling from North Carolina, USA to Bangalore, Karnataka, India.

My flight schedule was: 2-hour flight from NC to JFK (Friay afternoon), 7-hour flight to BRU (arrive Saturday morning), 8-hour flight to Delhi (arrive Saturday night), then (next Sunday morning) a 2-hour flight to Bangalore. Since I did not book my own tickets--they are courtesy of my Smart Structures program--I didn't even notice that I was overnighting in Delhi for about 7 hours. Luckily I was traveling with two other participants all the way from JFK so we exchanged emails about how we would deal with that layover. Not that the layover went as planned, but I'll get there. ;D

The flights were mostly uneventful, as was the airport in Brussels. I was interested in comparing my flight to Brussels, (operated by American) and my flight from Brussels (operated by Jet Airways). The second flight was definitely more comfortable, but it also just felt more luxurious. The AA flight had two movies, but the screens were in the center of the aisle so I, being tall and sitting in the window seat, could not see a lot of the screens. The food was okay, but mostly it just felt cramped and I'm glad I slept for some of that flight to get it over with.

In comparison, my second flight was GLORIOUS. There were screens in the backs of the seats with Hollywood movies, Bollywood movies, games, music, the whole shebang. The quality of the food on both flights was about the same, your usual airplane meal and snack, but I was delighted to be fed. I haven't been fed on a plane since I was five or so. I watched most of the Bollywood movie Robot, of which I had seen a few hilarious clips before this trip, and would have finished it except I accidentally exited the movie and reentering started you from the beginning with no good fast-forward option. So instead I watched ""Always Kabhi Kabhi"" (""Always Sometimes"") which is similar to High School Musical in style.

Things really took a turn for the adventurous in Delhi. There we were supposed to get off the plane, pass through immigration, get our bags, pass through customs, then check back in through a domestic transfer point to get back into the secured domestic area where we could get to our transit hotel, an hourly hotel within the airport. Unfortunately, we managed to get through immigration without a fuss, passing under some cool statues of huge hands in Buddhist or Hindu signs, but it was getting our bags that gave us trouble. Apparently the baggage handling system in Brussels broke down, and our plane was forced to leave with a large number of bags missing. This translated to my first true glance into Indian culture.

You see, it seems that one does not queue up in India. One MOBS. When people realized bags were missing, everyone flocked to the Baggage Enquiries desk, manned by a couple truly unlucky people that day. People were angry, voicing frustrated complaints in tones of voices that would probably have someone intervening in America with calming comments. The paperwork process to report our bags was roundabout and time-consuming: once you got a paper from the desk, you filled it out, gave it back to them while they filled out another form that they gave back to you to take down to a guy 50 feet to the left so he could stamp it and you could bring it back to the desk. This meant that this angry mob was stuck in front of that desk for hours. I hung out at the back. I wasn't going anywhere. Why get entangled? I was ridiculously amused, though, especially after they ran out of forms, went to get more, and were passing them out from the front of the mob. You've seen footage of the stock market, a huge group of agitated people waving papers in the air? Yeah, it was like that. I saw two guys wich a stack of papers almost go into a tug-of-war game and rip the whole stack. So, so amusing. And so different from anything I'd see back home.

After about two hours of hanging near the back of the mob and chatting with friendly Indian people who told me foods to eat, where to visit, Patrick and I (Yao did not check any bags so he had already gone to the hotel) decided we wouldn't bother to go to the hotel, we'd just crash the terminal. So we ""went through"" customs--it was deserted and we had no bags to be checked anyway--and into a really nice terminal. I partook in a sponge-bath in one of the bathrooms because I felt pretty gross and needed to wake up. There were ladies cleaning in the bathroom, and when I asked them if I could dunk my head they smiled and nodded. But when I tried to wipe down the sink after I was done they shooed me out and looked a bit put out. One of the Indian professors I spoke with tonight said that Indian people take hospitality very seriously, and I think that me trying to clean up after myself might have been insulting their hospitality. Or taking their job. Either way, I think they weren't super sad to see me go.

In the terminal I bought a tikka sandwich (it's like chicken salad with curry and onions) that was packaged exactly the same as they sell tuna sandwiches from gas stations in the states, and some water. Things are cheap here: the sandwich and water cost less than 200 Rs (rupees) which is around $3, and I probably got really overcharged for both. A bit later Patrick and I relocated to our gate, and I bought 2 samosas and a bottle of mango juice for around the same price. The mango juice was super-sweet, just as I expected. It tasted like someone pureed some mangos, then extricated all the water they possibly could. I think there were over 100g of sugar in that drink, but it was de-ri-cious. The samosas were also tasty, and the guy at the coffee shop even heated them up in the microave, or as they say ""made it hot."" I tried to practice eating properly, with only my right hand, but I think my technique is still a bit foreign because I was biting chunks out of the samosas and I saw a guy tearing hunks off and dipping them in the provided ketchup. I'll have to try that next time.

After that, it was simply a matter of waiting before we boarded our last flight to Bangalore. Three other APSS participants were due to fly with us on that flight, and they only barely made the connection due to baggage/customs/etc. I don't remember much of the flight--I hadn't slept much, or well, in the last 36 hours so I sank into REM awhile into the flight and only woke up when we touched down. And then I was in Bangalore.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Mysore
July 14th 2012
Published: August 1st 2012


Mysore has always been one of the major tourist attractions in South India. My previous visit to Mysore was about 20 years ago, when I was in college. I still keep a lot of great memories of that college trip to Mysore and we remember some of the words from the tourist guide in the palace.

After we moved from USA to Bangalore, we wanted to visit all of the major tourist attractions around Bangalore and Mysore was an obvious choice. Many people from Bangalore visit Mysore and return on the same day. However, considering there are several places to see in Mysore, it may not be a fun trip if you rush from place to place with a tight schedule in hand. Two days is ideal to see most attractions in Mysore.

We wanted to make it a real fun trip and so we decided to spend 2 nights and 2 full days in Mysore.
Brindavan Garden, Mysore


We started after lunch from Bangalore. The drive was very comfortable in the highway. We were estimating to reach Brindavan Garden by around 4:30 but got lost the way in Mysore town and so it was about 6'O clock when we entered the garden. It was very crowded and we could not enjoy the garden since it was already dark. We took a small boat trip within the garden, watched the musical fountain and exited the place at about 7:30pm.
Our stay in Hotels



We did not have a hotel reservation in Mysore. That is becoming a practice for us these days. Most of the weekend trip we made were without a hotel reservation. Sometimes we landed in to trouble but most of the times we were able to find good hotels at relatively low rates when we walk in and ask for room rates. We returned to Mysore town from Brindavan and I started driving around looking for hotel. I stopped in front of a 3-Star hotel but they did not have any room available. Once I got in to the car after enquiring availability in the hotel, someone came in a scooter and knocked on the car. I drove away quickly since I didn't know his intentions. But he kept following us and started shouting and waving his hands. Finally I stopped the car in a crowded area and asked what he wants. Then he explained that he can help us get a hotel room at low rates in the available vacant rooms. After negotiating the rates, he took us to a hotel called ""Adhi Manor"" where he arranged an A/c room for us at a rent about 40%!o(MISSING)f their published rates.

Hotel Adhi Manor: The hotel was pathetic. Very poor quality rooms, lot of bugs around and not even the reception looked good. The bed was very old. Based on our request, they moved us to another room but that was no different. Next morning, the first thing I did was to find another hotel for the rest of our stay in Mysore.

Hotel Palace Plaza: After visiting couple of hotels, I found Hotel Palace Plaza, which turned out to be an excellent place for stay in Mysore. Rent was bit high compared to the low rates we got in the previous hotel but the stay was very comfortable. Due to the bad experience previous night, we did not had much expectations, but we all loved the new place. They have a restaurant called ""Dynasty"", which served very tasty food for us, looked very clean and have very friendly staff. I have written a bit more on the best restaurants in Mysore.
Mysore Zoo - the best attraction in Mysore



After a tasty breakfast at Dynasty, we visited Mysore Zoo. We spent about 3 hours in the zoo but the kids were very tired after walking all the way within the zoo. We somehow wanted to get out of the place, but even though tired, kids wanted to see all animals. The zoo was pretty crowded but since it is a huge area, the crowd did not make it uncomfortable. After seeing hundreds of animals, we exited the zoo and drove back to the hotel for a short break.

Keeping the taste of breakfast in mind, we returned the Dynasty restaurant in Hotel Mysore Palace for lunch and ordered some Chinese food. They served the hot food in the room. Not sure if it was because we were all hungry and tired, but we felt it was one of the best food we had recently!

Horse Safari

After lunch, we took a small nap and then came out of the room. We saw many horse safaris near the temple. We negotiated with couple of people and finally came down the rate from Rs 500 to Rs 250 for a 20 minute ride. (Later, we met other people who offer the same ride for Rs 75). During the 20 minute ride, they offered us to take to a great market place in Mysore were we can shop as long as we want and he will wait outside for us. And he said this was a courtesy to the visitors to Mysore, but it was cheating. He took us to a textile showroom were we ended up spending lot of money (our fault) and later realized the horse safari people took us there to get commission for the items we purchased.

After the safari and shopping, we returned to the hotel, took a shower, changed the dress and then started looking around for places for dinner. Even though we loved the food at the restaurant in the hotel, we decided to try something else for dinner. We had heard about the theme restaurant at Hotel Pai Vista, which was walking distance from our hotel. The restaurant looked very interesting. It was made with the theme of a jungle/forest. The waiters were dressed like hunters and they had lot artificial animals or stuffed animals everywhere in the restaurant. Food was bit expensive but was tasty. Kids enjoyed watching the animals and messing with the hunters!
Mysore Palace - the historical monument in Mysore



Mysore Palace is the giant palace of the Kings, which attractions millions of domestic and foreign visitors every year. Photography is not allowed inside the palace but you can take pictures outside the buildings. It will take about 1 to 2 hours to see and enjoy the palace. You can rent automated voice guide system which will give detailed history of each important buildings and rooms in the palace.
Shopping in Mysore



Mysore is a great place for shopping silk items and Sandal products. However, be aware of lot of fraud referrals. Taxi driver, auto rickshaw driver, travel guides - almost anyone you meet would refer you to some of the ""best market"" that is offering some ""special deals"" ""only on that day""! We fell into that trap multiple times and ended up wasting lot of money in various shops. For example, a tourist guide who offered to take us to many attractions like Sandalwood factory at a very nominal fee of Rs 40. We drove all the way with him just to see a small shop, which claimed is the factory. We were expecting a huge factory where they cut big trees and make various things from Sandalwood, but disappointed to see a small shop which wasn't worth the drive at all. Moreover, the guide had said the factory is open only on Tuesdays for visitors but we learnt from the shop that it is open for all any day.

Getting here, going there, etc


desk/work area
I've made it here... in one piece. Thank the deity (also known more commonly as Ina).



I had a couple of ideas last night for names of my first entry. They all came to me on my cab ride from the airport to my apartment. The country (this area at least) feels similar to the Western Caribbean, with blocky, cement dominated architecture, similar food and sporadic packs of wild dogs (they're not dangerous... from what I hear). There are many things here that are direct imports from the West: one block we drove down had a series of signs for a McDonald's placed every few steps... McDonald's, 149 steps ahead! McDonald's, 113 steps ahead! McDonald's 86 steps ahead! McDonald's, on your right! But my favorite: a sign for Hot in Cleveland, Betty White's new show (the inspiration for this post's title), which I've actually rarely seen advertised in the U.S. I guess in today's world, no matter how far you travel on this rock, you're never that far from home.

Getting here took quite a toll: Qatar Airways figured out my plot to have my own row and bumped me to what they promised was a much
kitchen/dining nook
Don't worry, I won't be eating the fruit
better location on the plane. They sat me next to a father and daughter who were nice enough, but we were in an emergency exit row so even though I had extra leg room, there was nowhere in front of me to stow my backpack that I filled with goodies for the trip, so I had to put it overhead. I tried sleeping the full twelve hours to Doha, Qatar (my layover), but was interrupted by people kicking me on their way to and from the bathrooms and soda carts knocking into my left elbow. Since our plane landed 20 minutes late, I made it to my connecting flight with only 15 minutes to spare. Luckily, security in Doha was efficient (you get to keep your shoes on your feet!). I left on a Sunday night, got here on a Tuesday morning at 3 am, and slept until 6 pm, which means I haven't seen the sun in a very long time (don't ask me to do that math).

My apartment (pics posted) is as nice as expected; I've got a kitchenette, a large living room, a dining nook, desk for work, large bedroom with king-sized bed, and a
living room
spa inspired bathroom all to myself!

Traveling within Bangalore in interesting, to say the least. Unfortunately, leaving the hotel by foot is not recommended, and there isn't much around the hotel other than furniture stores and crumbling bodegas (I'm sure they have a name for them here, but I've yet to learn it), so I will be spending quite a bit of time in my apartment. For trips other than to and from work I will have to find myself a driver since renting a car is impractical and driving in the city is pretty dangerous: red lights mean nothing, lines in the road are mere suggestions, sidewalks don't exist, and the car horn is a well developed but little understood language by foreigners. Thank god wages here are low and the exchange rate is favorable; a personal driver it is!

Work starts tomorrow at 1pm local time. At this point, I am content with my accommodations and am optimistic about this trip. I will have a better feel for how things will go the next six months in the coming days as I assess what work will entail and get a sense of what Bangalore has to

offer. More to come!

Until next time,

View of the beautiful hills from Divine Euphoria
I just came back from a trip to Divine Euphoria, one of the most attractive weekend destination near Bangalore. Whenever we travel to any vacation places or picnic spots around Bangalore, I take down a lot of notes hoping to blog about it, but I hardly get time time once I get back home. Even though we have visited most of the popular weekend destinations around Bangalore and have taken hundreds of photos, I have published only a few so far. I am hoping to write about them all in the coming few months, once our kids start going to school after the vacation.

Divine Euphoria is our favorite weekend destination and picnic location around Bangalore. Yesterday was our third visit to this amazing farmland picnic place, after I purchased a small plot there to build our own farmhouse. Before I go too far, let me give some background about this place and how we found this place.

After spending a good part of our life abroad, we decided to come back to our home country and spend the rest of our life here enjoying what we really love. Buying some farmland having lot of animals and lot of
Birds in the farmland
fun was one of the entertainment plans. I started searching for some kind of ""managed farmland"" where someone else will take care of all the work and we just need to spend our time with plants and pets. I posted the requirement in some forums and someone pointed us to Divine Euphoria. When we read more about them, it was like our dream coming destination.
Divine Euphoria FarmLand project near Bangalore


You can look at their website and get more information. Here is a high level overview of this farm land project:


• Divine Euphoria is a Farm Land style vacation destination near Bangalore, India
• It is located on the Sangam Road, after Kanakapura, about 65 km from Bangalore
• You can buy small plots there and build your own farmhouse
• You cannot build any concrete/cement buildings. You cannot build a house to live for practical reasons (unless you love to live in a typical Indian village with no access to schools, hospitals, colleges, offices etc)
• Legally, you can build only farm house to take care of the farm, but practically, it can be a vacation home in the style of a farm house. There are many styles of
The boat house being built in Divine Euphoria
farm houses already built by many people which include wooden cottage, mud house, tent house etc.
• Divine Euphoria is a resort-cum-farm land. There are lot of common facilities like library, swimming pool, club house, indoor games, outdoor games, pets, animals, walking trails and so on.
• They have preserved a farmland atmosphere, even though it has all facilities of a resort. You will see an ideal farmland there with lot of animals, fishing ponds, lakes, birds etc. The place is sourrounded by Hills on all sides. You can see a distant view of a Dam built for irrigation purposes. They have a restaurant and most modern amenities you see in luxury villages.

Our recent visit to the farmland near Bangalore


We started from our home in Sarjapur Road, in Bangalore at about 8:45 in the morning. Since it was a short day trip, we decided to go by a taxi instead of driving myself. It took about 1 hour 30 minutes to reach the farmland. The drive through the villages and hilli areas was fabulous. One thing to note is, once you leave Kanakapura town, you will not see any shops, not even a country tea shop. So, if
Hanuman statue at the famland
Divine Euphoria is a farm land project near Bangalore
you are planning to visit the Divine Euphoria farmland, but some snacks, drinks and anything else you need from Bangalore itself or from Kanakapura. We spend about 6 hours in the farmland watching the birds and animals. Spend some time in the Yoga center which was on top of some high elevations and in the bottom of a big hill. You cannot find any better place to do some yoga and meditation. The swimming pool, boat house, library and boat house are not operational yet but we spend some time looking at the constructions and also listening to their marketing talk about the ambitious future plans! I think if they implement atleast 50% of their plans, Divine Euphoria will become the best picnic destination around Bangalore.

We met one lady from Punjab or Mumbai who was living there in a tent cottage. She seem to be a frequent visitor with her children and grand children. This time she was with her son and was planting lot of fruit trees in her farm plot. She owns a pretty big plot there and has planted a lot of trees and vegetables. I wonder if she would be able to pick the
Tent cottage at farmland near Bangalore
Here is a ready to use tent house in Divine Euphoria. This tent house was already occupied by a lady visitor from Mumbai. She purchased a farmhouse plot at Divine Euphoria after reading the reviews about the project. She is from Mumbai and comes all the way to this place for vacations. When I met her, she said it was her 5th visit to the place.
fruits/vegetables unless she visit often. When I asked her about it, she simply smiled and said her intention is not to make money out of vegetables. That was very true. I don't think even we bought the plot there to plant vegetables and harvest. Instead, people are there to have some quite and relaxing time with the nature and nurture the trees and plants.
Divine Euphoria Reviews


Like to have some time with the mother nature, away from the crowd and pollution of cities like Bangalore? You will not see any better place than Divine Euphoria. Even though there are many other farmlands near Bangalore, I don't see anything else even comparable to Divine. Whether you want to buy your own plot and build a farm house or buy an already built cottage or just rent a cottage for overnight stay or just have some day trip picnic, you can confidentally choose this place.

All good things come with some not so good experience as well. Here are some drawbacks I can think of about this place:


• No internet connection. If you are a busy worker and like to continue your online work while your family
Wooden cottage at Divine Euphoria
This is another cottage which look very beautiful. This is ready to occupy and serves the weekend visitors from Bangalore to this farmland often.
enjoy the vacation, you do not have any choices here (unless you have your own mobile internet or data card)
• No hospitals in the vicinity if you have an emegency. No doctor on call. Medical help may be too far.
• No restaurants nearby. You will have to either cook yourself or depend on their restaurant, which is not yet completed.
• Slow progress of the project. They launched the project more than a year ago, but it is not even near completion. Day picnics and night stays are offered only for the potential customers and people who have contacts with them. Not yet open for public. Very less visitors currently.
• Private properties are mixed with common amenities. You will have no idea which cottage is occupied by private parties and which are common properties which everybody can walk in to.
• Too large area sorrounded by hills. Small kids may get lost within the property because of similar looking plots and roads.
• No internal transportation. You may have to drive or walk pretty long distance from one amenity to other. They said they will provide battery operated carts like Golf cart, but I don't see anything coming up yet.


I
Mud house at Divine Euphoria
This mud house is under construction. I think this is a model cottage, which visitors can rent for overnight stay at the farmland. I think visitors from Bangalore and other metro cities who live in concrete apartments would love to spend a few nights in a mud house.
have given my feedbacks to the developers few times and they seem to be listening to all suggestions. None of my suggestions are implemented so far, but they promised they will look in to all these. I have written more detailed review of Divine Euphoria Farmland project at IndiaTravelBlog.
How to reach Divine Euphoria


The farmland is located about 65 km from Bangalore city. If you are coming from Sarjapur Road or Martaalli area, take the Hosur Rd and then take NICE road. Exit at Kanakapura Road. You will reach Kanakapura within an hour. After Kanakapura junction, take the left turn towards Sangam road, which leads to the Cauvery river and the famouse fishing camps. After about 11 km, you will see a small sign board on the leftside to Divine Euphoria. The destination is about 1 km from the statehighway to Sangam.

Avoid travelling in the night to the place since it will be hard to get guidance in case you get lost. There are not many houses around and you will hardly see any people after sunset.

13.5 Mysore

Hab mich von Wwoofhost getrennt und ab in den Bus nach Mysore. Die Busfahrt ist ein Abenteuer.

Vor uns bleibt irgendwann ein LKW stehen und blokiert die Strasse. Nicht gross erwaehnenswert beim aussteigen faellt aber auf, dass unser Bus viel einer neongelben Fluessigkeit verliert. Ich haette auf eine Art Hydraulikflussigkeit getippt. Jedenfalls scheint es keinen zu interessieren, weiter geht die Fahrt. Irgendwann halten wir dann an und sie kippen Wasser nach. Warscheinlich war es doch nur Kuelfluessigkeit. Trozdem seltsame Farbe. Jedenfalls halten wir noch 2 oder 3 mal an. Einmal an einer Moschee, wo irgendein alter Mann scheinbar gar nicht gluecklich ist, dass sein gutes Moscheehahnenwasser jetzt als Buskuehlwasser missbraucht wird, einmal an einem Bach bei dem ich mich frage wie sehr sich der Bus ueber die Truebstoffe freut. Auf dem Weg fahren wir durch mehrere Wildreservate. Die Tiger bleiben leider verborgen aber immerhin sehe ich einige vermutlich halbwilde Elephanten. Irgendwann ist der Bus dann wohl doch am Ende.

Jedenfalls tauschen nach einer halben Stunde warten den Bus. Auf dem Pissoir der Busstation starrt ein Inder noch voellig dreist und ununterbrochen auf meinen Penis und macht am Ende noch anzuegliche Schmatzgeraeusche. Gluecklicherweise besetzen irgendwelche netten Studenten mir einen Sitzplatz im neuen Bus. Nach 8h statt 5h Fahrt kommen wir in Mysore an. Such mir Zimmer und erkunde noch ein wenig die Stadt. Anfangs sind meine Abwehrmechanismen noch auf Alarmstufe Rot. Aber hier in Mysore sind die Menschen netter. Sie schleppen einen zwar auch in ihre Laeden aber sie sind freundlich, geben einem nuetzliche Tipps und sind nicht beleidigt wenn man dann doch nichts kauft. So komm ich auch in einer kleinen Raeucherkerzenmanufaktur vorbei und bekomme den nuetzlichen Tipp, dass der teure Palast heute umsonst sei und Abends toll bleuchtet wird.

Auf dem Weg dorthin spricht mich noch ein Inder an. Irgendwie ist mir sofort klar, dass das kein Verkaufer ist, dafuer hat er ein viel zu unverbrauchtes Gesicht. Ist er auch nicht. Nach kurzem Smalltalk kommt die Frage: ""Are you gay"". Nach hoeflich verneinen und kurzem weiteren Gespaech fragt er: ""You are a 100% not gay"" und ""You never like to try sex with a man"". Ich glaube irgendwann ist er dann ueberzeugt, ich mach ein Foto vom Palast und verliere ihn ausversehen. Ich haette mich gern noch mit ihm unterhalten aber es kann gut sein, dass er lieber weitere Europaer anquatschat als weitere Zeit mit mir zu vergeuden. In Indien gibt es offiziell keine Schwulen. Homosexualitaet erfaehrt in Indien absolut keine Toleranz. Dementsprechend trauen sich die Schwulen hier natuerlich nicht sich zu outen und muessen es bei toleranten Europaern versuchen bei denen ihr Geheimnis zumindest Gewahrt bleibt. Interesannterweise werden Transvestiten toleriert. In Mubai konnte man die abundzu sehen. Als ich Ajeet (Mumbai) nach ihnen gefragt habe sagte er:"" Ja klar, das interessiert niemand. Die haben ja keine Rechte."" Aber Schwule? Das liegt ganz ausserhalb des Vorstellbaren.

Vor dem schoen beleuchteten Palast sind wir Weisse wieder Fotoobjekt. Unter anderem wird mir fuer ein Foto ein kleiner Sohn in die Hand gedrueckt der mir vor lauter Angst dann ueber die Hand pinkelt. Ich treff hier auch noch Jeremy aus Australien. Angehmer Typ und wir trinken spaeter noch ein Bier.

14.5 Mysore

Morgens ab auf so nen heiligen Huegel von Mysore. Chamundi Hill. Sehr langweilig. Ganz nett sind die Treppen die ich hier runterlaufen kann. Auf dem Weg bin ich wieder Fotoobjekt aber so treff ich eine nette indische Familie und weil ich gerade nichts besseres zu tun habe begleite ich sie spontan in den Zoo. Der Zoo ist vergleichbar zu deutschen Zoos, nur dass wie vieles in Indien alles gerammelt voller Menschen ist und teilweise irgendwelche affigen Polizisten meinen sich aufspielen zu muessen und Menschen mit ihrer Pfeife weiter zu scheuchen. Ist aber ne nette Sache mit ner indischen Familie in den Zoo zu gehen. Ein riesiger Zufall will es auch so, dass ich 2 Tage spaeter 3 Jungs von denen mitten auf der Strasse in Bangalore wiedersehe.

Mittags bin ich mit Jeremy und einem Amipolen Tam unterwegs. Witziger Unterschied. Jeremy isst vor allem Strassenessen schlaeft auch mal auf ner Bank und versucht jede Rupie zu sparen. Tam benutzt nichtmal Sonnencreme, ist Vegetarier und auch sonst sehr auf Sicherheit bedacht. Wir Essen in einem kleinen billigen Resraurant das sichtlich nicht zu Tams behagen ist. Spaeter schauen wir uns nen Bollywoodfilm an(natuerlich nicht Englisch). Ein Riesenspektakel mit Gangstern, Himmel und Hoelle, ausdrucksstarken Gesichtern und Gesten, schoenen Frauen die einem anderen Schoenheitsbild entsprechen, viel Liebe und mit immer wieder pfeifendem und jubelndem Publikum. Auf jeden Fall ein Muss wenn man nach Indien geht.

Danach trinken Jeremy und ich noch Bier in der billigsten Kneipe die wir finden und freuen uns darueber.

15.5-17.5 Bangalore

Morgens mit dem Bus nach Bangalore. Ich goenn mir die Deluxe AC Version. Ungluecklicherweise kommen wir an nem anderen Busterminal an. Und weil ich nicht Rikshawfahrern in die Haende fallen will sprech ich nen Inder an. Der ist auch gleich hilfsbereit, bezahlt sogar mein Busticket. Danach sucht er mit mir ein Hotelzimmer, bezahlt sogar noch einen anderen Kerl der ihm dann hilft ein Zimmer fuer mich zu finden. Total abgefahren. Aber ab da wird es dann nervig. Er nennet sich uebrigens Happy der nette Kerl. Setzt sich erst mal in mein Hotelzimmer und raucht erst mal eine. Bestellt einen Kaffee und bietet mir Kekse an. Danach baut er doch tatsaechlich in meinem Zimmer ne Tuete und raucht sie. Ich lass es hin und her gerissen in Dankbarkeit und Ablehnung ueber mich ergehen. Abends will er sich noch zum Abendessen treffen. Eigentlich ungern aber wir tauschen mal Nummern aus. Er schreibt dann echt seltsame SMS mit Lebensweisheiten und Komplimenten und ich frage mich, ob der Kerl eben nur ein kauziger kiffer ist oder ob er anderweitig Interesse haben koennte. Mir ist das nicht gehaeuer und ich Entschuldige mich fuers Abendessen. Auch das Zimmer ist echt eher bloed. Haett ich selber geschaut waer ich halt nach dem Lonely Planet gegangen und haett vielleicht auch noch andere Reisenede getroffen. So geh ich halt allein los und finde Bangalore nicht sehr spannend. Bangalore bietet zwar schon das ein oder andere, und auch das Sciencemuseum ist echt ganz lustig. Aber ich treffe hier niemand fuer ne vernuenftige Unterhaltung. Ist halt eine Businessstadt und keine Tourisstadt.

Ganz bemerkenswert ist noch, dass ich als einmal ne Rikshaw nehme und mich doch zu mehr als einer Fahrt ueberreden lass. (jaja selbst Schuld) Es klang wie ein gutes Angebot. Tatsaechlich faehrt er mich aber vor allem zu kleinen Sachen die gerade auf dem Weg liegen und auf seinen Fotos gut aussahen um mich dann zu ueberreden in seine Shops mitzukommen. Weil der Rikshawfahrer irgendwie nett ist und ehrlich ist lass ich mich mal drauf ein auch wenn ich weiss, dass ich nichts kaufen werde. Jetzt hoert man ja immer, dass sie einen in die Laeden von Freunden und Verwandten ziehen. Nein viel ausgefeilter. Die haben ein Couponsystem. Wenn ich 5-10 min im Laden bleibe und Intresse heuchle bekommt der Fahrer einen Benzingutschein und wenn ich etwas mehr kaufe bekommt er Schulbuecher fuer seine Kinder. Gut, die Schulbuecher sind garantiert gelogen um die Mitleidsschiene noch zu fahren, aber trotzdem haben die ein ausgekluegeltes System. Mit mir hat das halt ueberhaupt nicht funktioniert weil ich kein Kaufinteresse heucheln kann wenn es nicht da ist und ich verlasse die beiden Laeden nach 2 min wieder. Geht mein Rickshawfahrer halt lehr aus.

Am 17.5 steig ich dann in den Zug nach Jaipur.

What is Buddha Poornima


The Vaisakha Poornima (full moon day of the first Lunar month) is known as Buddha Poornima Goutama Buddha the founder of Buddhism had taken birth on this day. It is believed that Buddha also got enlightened on the same Vaishakha poornima and also passed away on the same day of Vaisakha Poornima.

Where is Pyramid Valley


From Bangalore City, drive towards Kanakpura on National Highway 209. After a few kms you will cross NICE ring road. Then after about 18 kms you will find a sign board to take a left turn for Buddha Pyramid.

I had given more details on the route and other info on pyramid valley in my previous article. Please refer the details of pyramid valley in the following links. http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/25/maitreya-buddha-pyramid-bangalore.html



Registration for Participation


Buddha Poornima is celebrated every year in Pyramid valley. Brahmarshi Patriji conducts his music meditation through his mesmerizing flute performance. This year (2012) the Buddha poornima was celebrated during 4th-6th May 2012.

The participation to the celebration was based on Registration. The registration charges were Rs 450/- per person for all three days, which included daily 3 times food and shared accommodation inside the pyramid valley.

1st day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


We reached there in 4th May morning, the first day of celebration. We got of participants’ badges from the reception. We saw a queue for the breakfast and got into the queue. That time there were about a thousand people, but many more were just flowing in.

Our accommodation was inside the Pyramid. Generally the pyramid is meant for meditation only. But only during Buddha poornima celebration, a large number of participants are accommodated inside the pyramid, because of shortage of general accommodation.

Maitreya-Buddha Pyramid is world’s largest meditational pyramid. The size of the pyramid is 160ft. x 160ft. Height 102 ft (equivalent to 10 floor building). To know more about Buddha Pyramid, please read my previous article in journalsite:

http://journalsite.tk/journalsite/articles/viewarticle.asp?articleid=213

During daytime there were some spiritual classes. Some experienced people shared their experiences on spiritual journey. Below is a picture of the classroom.



During lunch time I noticed a crowd was moving near lunch area. When I went near the crowd I saw the crowd was around Brahmarshi Patriji. People were shaking their hands with Patriji and conveying their wishes. I also had the privilege of shaking hands with Patriji (picture below).



The evening started with an inaugural function. That was the first of the three-day celebration. The celebration was conducted at the amphitheatre inside the pyramid valley. There was a huge gathering of about five thousand people.



There were three eminent guests who delivered their valuable speeches. Patriji was a perfect anchor on the stage, coordinating the guests and participants, sometimes interpreting English speeches into Telugu and sometimes stimulating the crowd with humorous comments. After the spiritual lectures, music and cultural programs continued on the stage while people slowly moved for dinner at their convenience.

2nd day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


The second day morning started with a music meditation at 5 AM. We were woken up at 4.30 to attend the meditation. Brahmarshi Partriji was playing flute with three others artists on other instruments. All the participants were sitting on meditation (picture below), some on chairs and some on the lawn.



Meditating on the flute music was a beautiful experience. Besides Patriji’s performance on flute was also extraordinary. As getting up at 4.30 AM was difficult for many, some participants were taking their nice sleep in the name of meditation. After music meditation Patriji spoke on Buddha poornima and spirituality. Overall it was a fantastic experience.

We had to make queues for breakfast and bathrooms. Some preferred to go to toilet first and some preferred to have breakfast first. When I saw a big crowd near toilets I decided to have breakfast first fearing that the food might finish if I make late.



After breakfast I thought to explore the valley. When I walked behind about half km, I discovered a beautiful Shani temple. There was a remarkably big anthill near the Shani temple (picture above). After visiting Shani temple I came back to the program.



During daytime there were spiritual classes (picture above). Besides, there was also a dance performance by Pyramid Spiritual Science Academy, Bangalore. In the afternoon some of us we went to Tapasthali, about half km on hillside inside the pyramid valley.



There is a beautiful statue of lord Shiva in Tapasthali. Many people were doing meditation near the shiva statue. From Tapasthali we could see the Pyramid nicely. The views of the hills and the valley were beautiful. I could also see the shani temple from distance which I visited in the morning.

The evening program started at 5 PM in amphitheatre. There were two guests who delivered their speech. Patriji also mesmerized the audience with his beautiful songs and speeches. There was lot of music and cultural program afterwards while the dinner was going on simultaneously.

3rd day of Buddha Poornima Celebration


The 3rd day morning again we were woken up at 4.30 to attend the music meditation at 5 AM. Patriji was on flute with three other artists, who were on tabla, violin and mandolin (picture below). All the people were enjoying the flute and doing meditation at the same time



The third day was the last day of the celebration as well as the full moon day or birthday of Lord Buddha. After the music meditation, Patriji spoke on Buddha, Meditation, Pyramid Meditation, Pyramid Masters and on other spiritual concepts. He spoke about the concept of “Maitri”, “Karuna”, “Mudita” and “Upeksha” the four methods of dealing with others.

After the morning program, we had to stand on long queues for food. The food area was near the amphitheatre (the program area) which was about half a km away from the toilet area. Although it was very irritating to walk half a km for going to toilet, soon I realized the benefits, as it was a good compulsory exercise to digest the food and stay active.



The lunch queue was longer than the previous days (probably there were more participants on the last day). There were about six food counters (three starting counters and three repeat counters), but there were endless queues near each food counter. Some wise foodies like me were taking the food plate and standing immediately in the queue near repeat counter, finishing the food plate while standing in the queue.



Before evening program, we saw Patriji walking near the Pyramid surrounded by a large number of followers (picture above). People were shaking hands with him. Some people were having quick interactions. Patriji was also wishing people in different styles.

The evening program started as usual at 5 PM. Patriji gave his valuable speech to the audience. Patriji is not only a spiritual leader he is many in one. He was coordinating all the programs on the stage as the main anchor; he was interpreting speeches in between Hindi, English and Telugu, honoring the guests with shawls and gifts and doing many other activities on the stage. His songs (prayers) and speeches were very inspiring.



The evening program continued with cultural programs, songs, music and dances by various artists. There was also a group meditation till late night. It was the night of the celebration, the full moon day, the auspicious birthday of Lord Buddha.

At the end


My experience went fine with all the events of the three-day celebration. The participants were mostly from Andhra Pradesh, followed by Bangalore, followed by other places. I was quite impressed to see such a big crowd coming from different parts of the country. In my guess there were more than five thousand participants.

Personally I liked Patriji’s flute performance and spiritual speeches. He says he is against all doctors and healers of any kind. He advises to live without fear of death and be ready to accept death happily at anytime. Some of his speeches are to be understood not just by words but in right context with appropriate spiritual maturity .

How to reach Sangam


Sangama is about 95 kms from bangalore, the place of confluence of two rivers – Arkavathi and Kaveri (Cauvery). Mekedatu is about 5 kms on the other side of the river. We had visited the place last year and liked much. Incidentally we visited the place again this year. However, the visit was still interesting.

From Bangalore you have to go to Kanakapura and then take the road going to Sangama/ Mekedatu. I had gone there last year and given the route details in my previous article. Please refer http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/27/sangam-and-mekedatu.html
Visiting Sangam again after a Year


Last year when we visited Sangam, we visited Chunchi falls and could not get time for visiting Muthathi. This year we had no plans for Sangam again, but the plan was for Muttathi and Bheemeswhari. But on the day of visit, we thought why not to cover Sangam again. Driving 45 kms on highway is simpler than driving anywhere within Bangalore city. The decision was not bad. The road was very good. We soon reached there in Sangam.



The road to Sangam is always fascinating with large number of mayflower trees on both sides of the way – as if ready to greet all the visitors.

Interestingly it was the same summer season as our last visit. Hence, the scenery was not much different. As before, there was not much of water in the river. As it was not a holiday, there were less number of people. We soon got into the water for bathing.



After getting into the water, we marked that the water was dirty and there were various types of insects in the water. I was scared for a moment and was about to get out of water. But next moment I saw others bathing very happily and became fearless. Enjoyed water for a long time.


Comparing with last Year


Last year we had gone Sangam in April, the water was about 2 to 3 feet in average. This time it was May, hence the water was even less at many places. Crossing the river was much simpler.

Bathing although was difficult with less water you could always walk to a place where there was slightly more water.

Last time it was a Sunday, so there were about 500 visitors. This time it was a regular day, the number of visitors were about 100.

Because of less people, the bus to Mekedatu was waiting indefinitely to be filled up with passengers.

Some more constructions near the entrance, other things were almost the same.


The Sangameshwar Temple


After having bath in Sangam, we visited Sangameshwar Temple, which is just near that place. It is a small temple, but neat and clean. There are lot of monkeys around, they took our bag, opened up everything to see if there was any thing of their interest. Luckily left the bag there at a distance.


The word of caution


The river baths, whether in Sangama or in Muthathi or other places, are considered to be risky. Many people loose their lives every year in Sangam and similar places. Besides there are Crocodiles in some seasons. One has to be careful about those too.
Other places nearby


While going to Sangam and Mekedatu, you can combine visiting other places such as Chunchi falls, TK falls, Pyramid Valley, Muthathi, Bheemeshwari etc. However, from my experience, combining too many things does not give you adequate time to see the places. I would suggest not combining more than two places to visit in a day.

You must read my previous article on Sangam in order to make this experience complete http://freejournal.heliohost.org/freejournal/?/articles/2012/03/27/sangam-and-mekedatu.html as I have deliberately not mentioned many things in order to avoid repetition.

Chilligeri Estate
So far I was pretty happy that my tour was going as per my plan. However I was rather confused to opt from the 4 spots which were not in my schedule. Irpu Falls, Kabini WLS, Nagarhole NP and Shivanasamudram waterfalls. I had previous appointments to attend in Kochi so I would be heading for Kerala, this was the thought. I finally voted for Irpu Falls as the place was not known to the tourists. After saying ‘virtual’ good bye to rest of the three places I went to bed as I had to wake up early next day.



I woke up at 6am and hit the road in next 15 minutes. I had to take care of my personal hygiene. I walked in to the bus stand in Mysore and from my research I knew that I had to take a bus to Gonnikopal. There are several routes to reach Irpu. One can follow the Hunsuru-Gonikoppal route to Kutta, Mysore-Nagarhole route to Kutta and finally Mysore-Kabini route to Kutta. But as red from the magazines, I decided to follow the Gonnikopal route because of maximum availability of public transports. I took a bus which was on the
Road through Chilligeri Estate
way to Virajpet and as said earlier and again, buses in Karnataka are the best when it comes to schedule and accessibility. Within 5 minutes I was cursing down the Mysore-Madikeri road where I had my footsteps left on my previous tour to Bylakuppe (separate blog). This road wasn’t new to me but still it was pretty enjoyable early in the morning. The bus took more than an hour and half to reach Hunsuru and driving further 10km, took a diversion to the left and hit the Mysore-Virajpet road. First a few miles it was through the villages of Karnataka and later it hit the forest area. This was early in May and chance of a shower was bleak, so the lush green outfields were ‘green’ but not shining. Once the bus entered the forest area I picked myself up from the seat hoping if something could get caught in my eyes. As expected, in next 15 minutes I noticed a wild elephant on the right and the locals not seemed to show any interest as they were quite ‘used to’ with this kind of wild animals. The bus quit the forest roads and started climbing up the hills. The
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
road here was through the coffee and pepper estates. Most of the passengers were either working in one of those estates. I was really enjoying the scenic ‘pleasures’ and was thinking about my next journey from Gonnikopal to Kutta which was around 36 kms. Around 10:30 am I reached Gonnikopal. It seemed to me a small town with very basic facilities available. Then I didn’t know the challenges were in ahead of me.



I knew that I was in Coorg, so the first thing I decided to have was a ‘cup of coffee’. I walked in to a small restaurant, opposite to the bus stand and helped myself with a cup of coffee. It was as fresh as the beans were handpicked from the nearby estates. This part of Karnataka is enriched with coffee and pepper plantation and most of the homestays or resorts are either ‘an old estate’ or a part of it converted to a homely accommodation for tourists. I spent some time noticing the local crowd and their styles. The first thing I noticed was the typical style of wearing a ‘saree’ which eventually looked like a ‘nighty’ at the first shot. When asked
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
the hotel guy, he said that this was called ‘Kodava Sarees’, with no difference than the regular sarees we see but the style of draping made the difference. After spending a few ‘gazing moments’ at the ‘Coorgi beauties’ (as people may not know, the girls from Coorg are known for their unfathomed charm) I walked back in to the bus stand.



Oh my god ! I may have sounded like ‘Janice from famous Tv series Friends’. Where the hell the busses were going to ? I asked a fellow about the buses towards Kutta and he ‘scanned’ me from my head to toe and said.



‘Kutta????? No sir, it’s Kutta’



I understood the difference, It should be Kutta not Kutta (means dog in hindi), though the spelling is the same. ‘Narrow escape’ was the first call to me however I moved towards ‘a point’ where the bus to Kutta was waiting for me. All I could see people from different ages,sizes,heights were present in that bus. Forget about getting my butt to rest, I didn’t find a place to climb up. ‘Quit’ was the call from my heart and I followed
Flowers at Chilligeri Estate
that religiously. After 15 minutes another bus came and before I could even see the ‘face’ of it, it was all filled up with all proportions.



‘Shit, what the hell’, I whispered.



I quit again and this ‘Quit Bus’ revolt concurred for another one hour or so. It was 2:00pm then and I knew that I had to travel another 36 kms, had to find a place and then had to proceed towards Irpu Falls. I could see my ‘Plan of Titanic’ was sinking in front of me and like Edward John Smith, I was giving blunt looks towards the sky for a ‘hope’. Noticing my struggle, one generous fellow walked in and said something in Kannada. With my ‘great’ understanding, this was it.



‘Where are you going?’, the guy asked



‘Kutta’, I replied with the correct pronunciation.



‘Take the bus over there’, he pointed the same which I just ‘quit’ some 10 minutes ago.



‘Too crowded, no place to stand even’, I expressed my frustration.



‘Yes, there’s a festival in Kutta, today and hence everyone is heading up
Flowers
there’, he smiled and said.



‘How would I go then?’, I almost cried with my lost soul.



‘There would be a bus from Kerala, which would be an express bus to Kutta, try for that’, he had shown a ray of light to me.



‘And how long I have to wait for that’, I asked with my sincere ‘inquisitiveness’.



‘5-10 minutes, oh ! here it is’, he said and ran.



I took the last part of the conversation and chased him as he was my ‘pace setter’. I saw one ‘very’ colorful bus just entered the stand and it seemed a lot of people were waiting to get un board from it. I used my pair of elbows to ‘win’ a seat and finally I managed. I was pretty happy with my success and it was a sigh of relief. The bus didn’t wait too long and surprisingly with ‘not much’ people, it hit the road. I later came to know that being an ‘express’ bus and so the high price of the tickets (may be 10 bucks more than the standard ones), local folks
Flowers
try to avoid this bus. ‘Whatever’, I focused on the ‘road’.



The drive from Gonnikoppal to Kutta was perhaps one of the ‘most scenic’ bus journeys I’ve ever had. Long winding roads though lush green coffee plantations that you can feel the freshness and aroma. Since I ‘prized’ myself with a window seat, I could sense the ‘splash’ of cold breeze. So refreshing that in 5 minutes, I forgot my ‘Quit Bus’ revolt and was really enjoying the scenes. The entire journey seemed to be the same through ‘estates’ and finally around 3:30pm the ‘Green Beauty’ (Eventually, it was the name of the bus) dropped me in Kutta. It was a small ‘modern village’ with a very few shops, That’s what I could describe Kutta at a first glance. I knew I had to search a place for the day. I rather decided to walk in to a nearby shop. I bought a pack of cigarette and stroke a ‘business conversation’. This is what I do mostly. In a new place, I usually find the most ‘knowledgeable’ shop, buy something and then ‘band up’ a ‘casual conversation’ to get the details about the place.


Irpu Falls

‘Sir, any place to stay here’, I started with my as usual ‘smile’.



‘Only one lodge here to the right. Try your luck’, he replied.



I was bit shocked that why to try my luck. ‘Were there a lot of tourists arrived before me?’, Asking those questions to myself, I ‘crawled’ towards the board which was ‘Kutta Lodge’. The place was empty, not even a stray cat or dog was there to greet me.



‘Hello, anybody here?’, I knocked at the reception desk.



And after a couple of more ‘hard knocks’, one old lady showed up.



‘What you want?’ was the question from her, in a rough ‘note’.



‘Rooms to stay tonight’, I asked



‘Nothing’, she shut both the doors up.



I walked back to the same shop and asked for ‘reason’.



‘Sir, today being the festival, most of the guys was either ‘drunk high’ or went to the temple. You would hardly find any one’, he replied with a smile. I didn’t know whether it was a ‘note of proud’ or a
Flowers
witty one.



I stood there ‘all blacked out’ for another 15-20 minutes. Suddenly I saw one guy with a ‘three wheeler’ just crossed past me. I ran to him and asked for his advice to find me a place to stay tonight. That guy seemed was ‘in shape’ and fortunately could speak Tamil. I literally dragged myself in before he could reply ‘yes,no or maybe’. He couldn’t give me any fruitful answer so I had to open my ‘Book of Notes’. Found a few and immediately started calling them. The cellphone network seemed pretty good here and after a few more tries, I managed to get hold of ‘The Chilligeri Estate’. It was a lady.



‘Maa’m, I came all the way from Chennai, any place to stay in your estate?’, I cried for help.



‘How many guys you are?’, was the question from the other end.



‘Just me, alone’, was my quick reply.



‘Okay, Rs. 1000 a day including all meals, come’, Was the deal offered to me.



‘Sure, how far?’, I asked



‘Get a taxi, drive through the
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
Gonnikopal road for about 4 kms, find our ‘sign’, take left’, She finished all these words in 10 seconds maybe.



I had to stare at my ‘auto guy’, he seemed to have heard of this place before, but ‘what did she mean by taxi, I didn’t see any taxi here’, was the big question for me. The auto guy said that there was no taxi. All these ‘autos’ are referred as a taxis here. Incredible India ! he asked for Rs.50 to drop me to the estate. I agreed without any hesitation. We drove back through the same road I followed earlier and reached the estate within 15 minutes.



Wow ! Just Wow ! What a place to stay. Located in a remote valley with amazing Bramhagiri hills at the backdrop, amidst plenty of colorful flowers and coffee plantations, I really fell in love at the first sight. I was offered to have lunch and I decided to skip as I was ‘too late’ for The Irpu Falls which was some 6kms away from this place. Meanwhile I clinched a small ‘friendship’ with the auto guy,Pramod and without any minutes lost, I asked him
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
to drop me to the base of Irpu Falls. I knew that there wouldn’t be any public transport available to reach Irpu Falls which would eventually be located inside the Bramhagiri Wild Life Sanctuary. Pramod offered me a nice option that he would drop me to the falls and once I was done with my ‘photos’ I would give him a call to pick me up from there. I liked this offer and we started again. In next 15 minutes or so I was at the entry point of Bramhagiri Sanctuary.



It’s inside the Sanctuary so one has to walk about a mile from the entry point to reach Irpu falls. No vehicles are allowed rather there are no roads to reach the base of the falls. Pramod dropped me there and warned me repeatedly to wind up before 6pm, as the presence of wild elephants was ‘high’ and that was for two reasons. One, all the water bodies up in the hill had dried up and Two, Elephants couldn’t resist themselves from tasting ‘Ripe Jackfruit’ so they prefer to come down to the estates. It was around 5pm and I knew I may run out of
Inside Bhramhagiri WLS
light to take photos. With his warnings framed on my mind, I entered the Bramhagiri Wild Life Sanctuary. It was a walk through thick woods following a narrow stream which was the continuation of the water from Irpu Falls. I noticed a couple of ‘sign boards’ which had it mentioned that the ‘Largest Breed of King Cobra’ was actually spotted in this region. I don’t know why but I am not too friendly with this animal so I got ‘spine chilling’ sensation. After a mile’s walk, I reached Irpu.



If you have seen Hebbe in Chickmagalur, Irpu is not that mighty roaring falls, nor even gorging from ‘high heights’ like Hebbe. But the surroundings with mighty Bramhagiri and the wilderness gave this place a ‘heavenly felling’. I didn’t find a lot of people there except some guys from a nearby college. They were spending their time enjoying the streams of Irpu. I looked for a place where I could place myself for some ‘silky water’ shots. I missed my tripod again and felt like ‘kicking my butt’. The watch was moving as fast as it could, and with the available ‘natural accessories’, I managed to place myself
Irpu Falls
on a ‘large stone’ and took a few photos. Though Irpu was a small waterfall compared to the ‘mightiest’ I have seen in India, I was in love with this place. It was so serene one could expect ever. However, with a huge ‘unwill’ , I decided to walk back to the ‘gate’ , meanwhile I called Pramod to be there in next 15 minutes. When I reached at the gate, Pramod was there already and we returned to the estate around 6:30 pm.



I saw that the owner ‘lady’ was trying to say something. So to bring them to the comfort level, I asked if anything that I could have helped. She said that they had to attend the festival at the temple so would it be okay, if I could stay here all alone in this estate till 9pm. Without any hesitation I asked them to go, and once they left I was hovering around the estate. What a beautiful place it was and if you were there with your ‘sweetheart’, I bet you couldn’t have expected more romantic place than this. Plenty of birds,singing the ‘music of nature’. I was not completely alone, I
Sunset from Chilligeri Estate
had company of a ‘little cute’ Lhasa Apso ‘Jimmy’. Being one of the greatest dog lovers on earth, I was enjoying every bit of his company. I tried a few sunset shots and finally around 7:30 pm it was completely dark. I was feeling a bit of scary and thrilled as well. I was recalling the words of Pramod regarding the jackfruit and elephant story. As I could see some Jackfruit trees around ‘showcasing’ some mighty ones hang. The climate was so cozy as if ‘mother nature’ had her A/C’s on. There was a completion which may be the best part of this trip, I had not seen so many stars and fire flies at the same place. Millions or Billions was the question unasked. After a few hours hovering at the estate, around 9:45 pm, they arrived. Then I realized the ‘burning stay of hunger’ in my stomach. I recalled that I didn’t have anything since morning except a couple of cups of coffee. The dinner was served within 15 minutes. Though I was asked about my options still I asked to make it as ‘Coorg’ as possible. It was one of the best I have ever had. Coorg Rotis made with Rice Flour, with a series of veg: preparations with a glass of homemade wine. Marvelous ! Proper justification to the Coorgi hospitality. I was too exhausted after having such a wonderful diner and I was seeing everything ‘blank’. I didn’t know how much I slept but woke up early at 6:30 am. As instructed, Pramod was there to pick me up. And expressing my heartfelt gratitude I said ‘good bye’ to Chilligeri estate for one last time. I knew that I would be back soon for my ‘sweetheart’. I definitely would like to get lost deep inside the forest with her. Missed you !

When last I wrote we were waiting to get picked up by Sagar to head up north to his new wife's hometown to have another reception there.

We were sort of used to the way timelines work in India by this point, so although we had been told we would be picked up at noon, we had a feeling that might not be the case. We opted to have a drink in our favourite ""Aqua Bar"" to wait it out. Eventually Sagar showed up with his family in what can only be described as a party bus! It was like a comfy 15 passenger travel van/bus with sweet blue/green lighting and a great sound system. The van was to take us (myself, Josh, Jeff, Vanessa, and Brodie) and Sagar, his parents, his aunt, and Deepa. It's a good think that it was a comfy ride, because the journey was actually a lot longer than we expected. It must have been at least 400km north and it took many hours.

On the way, Sagar showed me some of the pictures of the wedding photographer on his computer and explained some of the parts that were confusing to us during the actual ceremony. The rituals and symbolism was endless - I couldn't possibly rewrite it all. But many of the traditions were really sweet, like the ritual of seven steps to show devotion to husband and vice versa. He also explained to me the five things that married women wear: a red forhead spot, a nose peircing, flowers in her hair, a necklace, and a toe ring. Apprantly the numbers 5 and 11 are considered lucky in India. You do things like burn five sticks of incense, or give five or eleven types of fruit in a basket as a gift.

A bit over half way, we stopped for dinner in a small town. Sagar ordered us a giant spread of food, but shortly afterwards Deepa informed him that her mother was making a bunch of food for us in Havari, so we shouldn't eat a full dinner. Whoops! So we cancelled our order and switched to ""snacks,"" but the snack was pretty much still a full meal for me. I was somewhat dreading getting to Havari because I forsaw a whole bunch of food being placed in front of a very full me. Sure enough, that's what happened...

Deepa's house was pretty amazing. It was about three floors high with an open concept design and a big winding staircase up through it. It also had a nice landscaped courtyard which actually had lawn. When we came back the next day we discovered it's multiple beautiful rooftop terraces and - our favourite element - an indoor swing!! There is a specific Indian festival that uses the swing, but it can be played on at other times of the year.

Shortly after we arrived we sat down for food. There were only 6 spots set at the table and there were tons of us, so it was a bit awkward to figure out who was supposed to sit at the table. At the end I sat at the table while a few others sat on a nearby bench, but I knew I would regret that decision because it would prevent me from escaping from food consumption. They constantly put more and more food on my plate and I felt so badly having to refuse, but I just couldn't do it. Some people have stomachs which seem to be able to expand to accomodate whatever is necessary - I am not htat way. I just can't eat if I'm not hungry, no matter how much pressure I feel. I hate it because food is so often a social thing and I frequently find myself feeling rude for having to decline food while others are just trying to be good hosts. This night was no different. The food was delicious, but the quantity was so much! Once we finished the bus took us to the small nearby hotel we would be staying the night in. The rest stayed behind because Deepa's family is quite orthodox and normally the men eat first and then the women, so half the group still had to eat. Whoops... should I not have eaten or not have sitten at the table? Sagar said it was fine. Ah well.

Considering we were in such a small town the ""VIP Suites"" which we were housed in were actually pretty nice. I wasn't sure what kind of accomodation they would have for us. Certainly no internet there, though! No toilet paper either, but luckily I'm always prepared =) The best part of where we were staying was the rooftop courtyard. I thought it would have been nice to sleep out there under the stars, but there were a whole number of guys who seemed to work for the hotel that slept out there, instead! I thought maybe they just didn't have anywhere else to sleep, but Sagar said they were there in case we needed anything in the middle of the night. Yikes! I am not used to the amount of ""attending to"" that we get in India. People are always serving food onto our plates instead of just leaving a serving dish on the table, or bringing our bags around, or just kind of hovering.

We were told to meet Sagar's parents at the reception for breakfast at 9am, but when we tried to find them they weren't there, and we weren't sure where we should be going. This didn't really surprise us, again, due to loose timelines here, so we just went back up to the rooftop and we all took some time to read in the shade. At one point, some guys silently brought over some little dixie cups of something hot (tea? coffee? there is so much milk and sugar we couldn't tell), which was pretty good. Around an hour later a nice man came to get us and told us to come down to the basement for breakfast. It turns out that we WERE supposed to have gone down at 9am, but we just didn't know what to do. So once we never turned up various phonecalls were made and this gentleman took us under his wing. Thanks goodness, because would have been lost. We sat in a row along a long silver table and were served some pretty tasty curries on palm leaves. After that, we were directed to the bus, which took us back to Deepa's house. It seemed that people were a bit surprised to see us there, but we were just following directions! This whole day was rather confusing.

We hung out with Deepa and got to know her better. She showed us the rest of her house, including the network of solar panels on the roof which are used to heat water for the house. She said that their set up was an older model, but they didn't want to upgrade because the monkeys would destroy the pipes! Sure enough, a metal tank up there was full of dents from them. I had no idea monkeys could do so much damage! We also enjoyed watching the wild pigs off the roof, frolicking in the garbage. Deepa had to go change into her wedding clothes for the next, and final, reception, so we amused ourselves on the indoor swing. The reception was supposed to start at noon but I think it was probably around 1pm when the bride and groom headed over in a cute red car decorated with flowers and signs.

This reception seemed a bit less formal and the atmosphere seemed a bit more fun than the other events. There were probably around 200 people in attendance, but Deepa seemed to know most of the people there and both she and Sagar appeared to have a good time. Vanessa and I weren't really dressed up when it started because we had just been shuttled around all morning without sense of what was happening when, but after sitting amongst everyone in their faciest saris we eventually became self-conscious and went upstairs to change into nicer clothes (the reception was in the hotel where we were staying). I took the opportunity to get one last use out of my pink Indian outfit that the Dugani's had bought for me. I love it!

These receptions have two parts: greeting the bride and groom on stage, blessing them, then getting a picture taken, and EATING. After we had done our bit on stage we were ready to eat. The giant lunch was in the basement area where we had had breakfast. Man, what a production!! The whole things was a finally organized, if slightly chaotic appearing, enterprise. Everyone was seated along rows of long tables. A long roll of paper tablecloth was laid out, and then the procession of servers began. They would slap down palm leaves and bottles of water (then people would wash their palm leaves with the water, we noted for our turn). Then various servers with buckets and ladles would whizz by dowling out curries and chutneys and breads and a bunch of things which were totally unknown to me. This would continue until no one could eat any more. Then the diners would stand up and leave, the table cloth-paper would be rolled up with all the palm leaves, the table would be wiped down, and the process would start again for the next seating. It was pretty impressive! It was a bit hard to get a spot, mind you, but fortunately, again, a few people took us under their wing and secured us a seating. After we sat down there was a loooong wait before anything happened, and we weren't really sure what was going on. Turns out they had ran out of paper roll, so everything had to be held up until some new paper could be acquired. It was worth the waiting, though. Mmmmm such good food! Probably my best meal in India. (Sagar told us later that the hotel guys were super happy that we enjoyed the meal).

Oh! And I forgot about the roti bread man! There was a guy set up in the corner with a giant hot plate in front of him. He must have been dying from heat, but he was great at what he does. Basically, he would scoop up batter from a giant bat and pour it onto the grill in perfectly sized circle pancakes. Dip, pour, dip, pour, dip, pour. He had real rhythm to it, working with his right hand and keeping his left hand on his hip, with kind of a pelvic thrust each time he poured. Then he would grab the spatula and flip flip flip! Some extra spices and greens of some kind were sprinkled on, then they would all get flopped into a giant bowl, ready to eat. Yum!

We were supposed to be on the road back to Bangalore by 3pm (the day before we were told noon...) but we knew that wasn't going to happen so we just went up to the rooftop and read until someone came to get us. Around 5pm, it was finally time to hit the road. We stopped off at Deepa's house to say final goodbyes. It was so touching to see the way the two families had bonded already. There was lots of love between them, that much was obvious. Deepa was staying in Havari for a few more weeks because she has to write her final engineering exams, then she will come to Bangalore to live with Sagar's family. From now on, she ""belongs"" to Sagar's family (but only in the sense that she's like their daughter, it's not a repressive thing). We were supposed to stop at a cousin's for tea, but mercifully we skipped that as it was getting late and we had a long, long drive back to Bangalore.

I think it was around 1am when we reached our hotel. For a lot of that journey I was glad I was in the back and couldn't see out the front very well. Ignorance is bliss when it comes to road travel for me in most developing countries, and this journey was certainly no exception. Rickshaw travel in the city is nuts, but at least you don't travel very quickly. Highway speeds with rickshaw-style weaving is a whole other ballgame. We did get a reminder of the dangers of the road, though. We passed an accident scene where a big SUV-type vehicle had hit and killed a bull. The bull was dead, but the vehicle was in pretty bad shape, too. I guess it's like hitting a moose back in Canada.

I think I'll end this entry here, and start another one for the post-wedding happenings.

The day after the final reception, everyone was ready for a little R&R. It had been a wild few days! Sagar really wanted to plan a special day for us, especially since it was the last day for the boys in India, so he took us to a resort just outside the city limits.

It was Sagar himself who picked us up from our hotel, and we managed to squeeze 6 of us in to his tiny compact surprisingly comfortably. I'm so impressed that Sagar can drive here - I think that's why he's such a calm guy in Toronto. If you can drive here, surely nothing can phase you! He took us to his family home where we transfered into a much larger car which could accomodate all of us, and which came with a driver. I realize now that an advantage of having a driver is not just the not-having-to-drive part, but also that you don't have to find parking really. They can just drop you off and swing back around when you need them. As you can imagine, parking is often at a premium in such a dense city.

The resort was gorgeous. It was like a huge, tropical, gated community with a mix of privately owned vacation condos and hotel suites, with resort amenities like a fitness club, spa, and big pool. We were especially taken by the pool because it has been so hot here and our hotel in Bangalore doesn't have one. After a buffet lunch (at which I pretty much couldn't eat anything, my stomach had finally quit), we took a walk around the beautiful grounds. I have to admit I felt someone like an exploitive British colonialist here, but I pushed the thoughts aside and just tried to soak in the serenity of the place. There were so many beautiful lush bushes, flowers, and birds - wonderful! Finally, it was pool time! While Sagar napped (well deservedly) on the pool deck, the rest of us changed into bathing suits and started playing. There was a big waterfall that you could sit under, and some polo balls we found provided endless entertainment. All in all, it was a really nice afternoon.

OK, I realize by this point you're probably thinking that I haven't exactly been slumming it during this trip, and you are partially right. But what can you do when your hosts are this kind?

After we had changed and dried off, we loaded back in the car to head back into town. We were going to a tourist area called MG road (Mahatma Gandhi, of course) to pick up some souvenirs. Also, Vanessa really needed to get a SIM card for her cell phone because she is staying here for a while after we leave, and we needed Sagar's help because we have had NO success in getting this thing. When she finally found a place that actually sold them, they told her they needed a copy of her passport! So she and Sagar set off to do that, while Josh, Brodie, Jeff, and I poked in nearby shops. In one shop, a really nice sales guy helped us out and I acutally bought quite a bit from him because he wasn't push at all. I mean, he was encouraging the upsell, for sure, but he was reasonable and calm about it. Earlier I had gone into a textiles place and instantly people were literally yelling at me and shoving products in my face. I hate that. I just ran away. No sale for them! Eventually Vanessa and Sagar returned with photocopy and 15 passport photos in hand (don't ask), and she got her SIM card. She was told it would be activated by the next night, but when she left me the next evening it still wasn't working... I hope it gets activated eventually.

Finally, it was time for the great day and the group travel to come to an end. The car dropped me and Vanessa off at the hotel (she would be sleeping in my room that night) and the boys picked up their luggage. They were all going back to Sagar's house for about an hour, then Sagar would drive them to the airport. Their trip is far from over - they were flying straight to Cambodia, and they are still going to Japan after that! It was crazy to say goodbye and realize I would really only see them for a couple weeks around convocation, then I will be moving to Calgary and we will be living apart for at least the next five years. For the past year I've been living in the same apartment building with them all, and it's been great.

When I got up to my room with Vanessa, I took the opportunity to catch up on emails. Ooooh boy was there a lot of them. I had a bunch of high priority, time sensitive Scout documents to review and a number of issues for school to deal with. It seemed that we still didn't have a speaker for convocation, which was supposed to be my job and I was really stressed about it. It had been a long few days and I was literally falling asleep at my computer by the time I shut it down. V and I decided not to set alarms for the next morning...

The next day, Tuesday, it was just Vanessa and I on our own. Our group had gotten so small! We had planned to hire a car to go to Bandipur National Park to do a wildlife safari this day after failing to make it happen on Friday, but during some late night browsing Vanessa had discovered the park was closed on Tuesday! Argggghhhh!! We had spent so much time figuring this out, too. At least we made the discovery before we got all the way there. So we spent a good portion of the morning trying to figure out a plan B. Honestly, getting around this city is really, really difficult. Every time we come up with an idea we have to work out how close it is, if we could possibly rickshaw there, will traffic be OK. Then there is the problem of figuring out where things are. See, we had wanted to check out a temple or two. There were a few good ones listed, but when we tried to look up their location it wasn't clear at all. Google maps would list multple locations for all of them. Others were too far out of the city.

Forget it.

In the end, we decided to go to the botanical gardens. It turned out to be a great choice! Sagar had said they had fallen into a bit of disrepair and I think that was true for a number of the areas, but overall the area was a green oasis in the middle of the city. We really enjoyed walking around. I particularly enjoyed looking at the different birds living there, which were similar to Canadian birds but not quite the same. A kind of bird Twighlight Zone. Like, there were sort of cormorants, but different. And harks, finches, and ravens that just weren't the same. There were some bird interpretive posters around but I couldn't match up any of the birds that I was seeing to those. There were lots of families in the gardens, which was nice to see. We made the mistake of engaging (only briefly, but that was enough) with some little hooligans over by a GIANT tree that we wanted to take a picture in. The followed us for like 15 minutes yelling for money. We hadn't experienced anything like that during our time here. We really didn't know how we were going to get rid of them because they clearly had nothing else to do then pester us (which they thought was hilarious), but we found an unlikely saviour in the form of a dog. There were dogs lying all over the gardens (including a very cute beagle!) but when we got to the edge of a lake, this one dog just started snarling and barking and lunging at the kids, who jumped behind benches for safety and forgot about us. I imagine they had not been good to that dog in the past, because I didn't see them do anything to him then. We made our escape, but kept one eye open for the little pack the rest of the time.

Unfortunately, we picked the hottest day of our whole trip for this outdoor excursion. Honestly, it was difficult to breathe it was so hot and humid. We ended up only being in the gardens for an hour but it seemed waaay longer than that, and we were completely wiped afterward. We had planned to walk around the area afterward and see what we could find, but after less than 5 minutes of heat stroke, crazy traffic, and a sidewalk-free neighbourhood, we gave up and flagged the first rickshaw we could find to take us to the sanctuary of an airconditioned mall. Hey, it was really, really hot, OK? Don't judge! We were just so exhausted we couldn't imagine doing anything else, so we went back to the movie theatre we had gone to earlier with Anjali. We considered watching a Bollywood movie, but in the end we went for an English one, that new Tim Burton one called Dark Shadows. The best part, though? The seats!!! The entire theatre was filled with lazy-boy style airchairs that fully reclined. They were so plush and cozy. Vanessa and I were in heaven. It may not have been a very cultural experience, but it was definitely the right choice for us at the time. The movie was better than I expected it to be, too.

When we exited the theatre we were hit with an unpleasant surprise: there was pretty much a monsoon happening outside. Like, serious torrential downpour. The kind where you are instantly drenched just from stepping out from undercover. Everyone was hoarding around the mall foyer because no one wanted to go out in it. I had actually been carrying around either a raincoat or an umbrella for most of the trip, but this particular day I had left them at the hotel. We waited around 20 minutes but there was no sign of it letting up, so figured we had better face the fact that we were going to get wet. We ran out into the rain and pretty much got into the first rickshaw we saw. We paid more than we should have but we didn't care - it was worth it to get home.

What followed was the most harrowing ride of the trip, which is saying something. The roads were all flooded, and our driver was young and wild. He also didn't have a windshield wiper (note to self: next time it's raining make sure you get in a rickshaw with a wiper). He kept taking one way roads the wrong way and driving through puddles and rivers that were so deep they would come up into the rickshaw. At one point we almost stalled out and I was SO worried we were going to get stuck but, miraculously, we made it. Phew. Now, we were wet and freezing. Quite a change from our heat exhaustion of earlier in the day!

Vanessa had another hurdle to pass at this point. She was supposed to go to an aunt's for supper and then go to her friend's apartment, where she will be staying for the rest of time. As I have said many times, though, travel is hard for us here and now she would have her big suitcase with her. She also didn't think a rickshaw driver would know how to find her aunt's address. It's hard to phone a cab becasue we don't have cell numbers which they require, and it is a constant struggle and negotiation with the hotel to make local calls here. EVENTUALLY she secured a cab to take her, and after a half hour's wait it arrived. I hear it screwed her over in terms of price, though, and then it supposedly ""didn't have change,"" either. Sigh. I'm not looking forward to getting to the airport tonight.

Vanessa left just in time, as I was hit with a rather unpleasant bout of traveller's diarrhea shortly after. Not a great night. But it in terms of timing I couldn't have asked for anything better. I was planning to take it easy today anyway. I got some drugs from the pharmacy this afternoon so I should be in better shape for my 24 hours or travel back to Canada tonight (I hope!). I changed from a window to an aisle seat, though, just in case =)

And that pretty much wraps up my India trip! I felt like this blog was a lot less fun and descriptive than my previous world tour ones. I think I was busier on this trip so it was harder to fit it in. Oh well. I think my pictures tell a better story of the journey. I'll put them up when I get home.

Bye until the next adventure!

***Note: I wrote this days ago (Saturday morning) but haven't had internet access since, so I couldn't upload it. Now it's Monday night and I haven't written anything else! I also don't have a fast enough connection to upload any pictures. Sorry! Hopefully tomorrow night I can summarize the past few days events. In the meantime, here is a tome to finish off last week.***



The internet seems to have cut out (good bye 100 rupees) so I’ll write this entry in Word and hopefully I can upload it later.



I think last night when I stopped writing I had finished the part about the engagement party. The next morning we all woke up, ate the delicious hotel breakfast, and then got dressed up for the wedding. Sagar’s family had bought us all amazing Indian clothing to wear for the occasion, which was amazing of them to do. Quite frankly, we looked awesome! The boys looked especially great in their outfits. By the way, I’m travelling with some in-law whisperers here. You know those kind of guys that can work a family reunion and have all the relatives gushing over them? Yep, that’s these boys. They are really great with everyone.



I should mention that this was a south Indian wedding, which is a bit different than the north Indian weddings which I think are a little bit more well known. I’m told north Indian weddings have the groom ride in on a horse and there is lots of dancing, etc. This one had a lot of blessings and rituals, but a bit less spectacle, I would say. So when we arrived at the wedding Sagar and Deepa were both up a the front of a giant room under a lavishly decorated tent awning. We had already missed a few things, like them playing a game where they fish in a vat of milk for their wedding rings. The tent was decorated with reams and reams of strands of fresh flowers. I’m not completely sure what was going on, but they were kneeling down and being dressed up a bit. Sagar had on a decadent turban and an additional headdress of jewels was being tied on. Eventually the couple left and then just Sagar returned. He went through a long time of blessings with a priest (?) where he had to touch various things, have various garlands put on, have candles waved around him, etc. We couldn’t see everything because often the camera people were in the way, but we had a decent view. The atmosphere was pretty casual. We were free to talk and wander around as we pleased.



Then Deepa came in and did the same thing. Next there was a big white sheet put up between the two and I think they were blessing each other (?). The sheet was dropped and much more blessing and rituals took place. Eventually the key part occurred: they exchanged golden necklaces and voila! They were married Then we all got to throw coloured rice at them. I liked that part. (I may not have the order of all of this quite correct). Next a big receiving line was formed and we all went up on stage without shoes to sprinkle rice on their heads and wish the couple good luck.



From there, it was time for lunch! (food has not been an issue on this trip!) Another big Indian buffet. After lunch we went back in to the wedding room for a bit because we were told the couple was going to do a fire ceremony of some kind, which sounded neat. However time waned on and we weren’t sure when it was going to happen, so we decided to make our exit. We were going to head to a mall to watch a Bollywood movie – the true Indian experience! First, of course, we did a photo shoot of us in our awesome clothing. I look like a giant in all the “girls only” pictures, however, because Anjali and Vanessa are both super small. In fact Vanessa is the shortest person in our entire class. When the boys are in, things balance out.

OK, so, we went back to our rooms to change out of our fancy Indian clothes and into western clothes to hit the mall. This time we weren’t going to mess around with cabs – we just walked up to the road and grabbed some rickshaws. Much easier! I’ll try to take a video of rickshawing later. It’s a bit of an adventure and not for the faint of heart, but it’s actually my favourite way to travel here. You get a nice cool breeze and if anything seems like it’s not quite right, you can just get out. Plus, no one is able to go very fast in the bad traffic so I feel like if we got hit we wouldn’t get TOO hurt (my mom just had a heart attack when reading that).



Once in the mall we went up to the top level (there were like five or six – it’s a huge mall!) and bought tickets for a showing. Anjali picked a good one out for us which had both action/adventure for the boys, and choreographed dance numbers for me. Perfect! We had a bit of time before the movie started so we split up to explore the mall. Jeff, Brodie and I happened upon “Play Salon” which had an unsecured wireless connection, so we loitered outside of there for a while with our smartphones. I think this mall is fairly new, and I got the impression that Bangalore doesn’t have a lot of buildings with escalators in them. At every escalator (and there are many with so many floors) there were at least two security guards stationed, armed with whistles. You got whistled at for EVERYTHING. Not facing forward, being too close to the person in front of you, being under a certain age without a parent, standing too close to the entrance or exit, or even walking up/down the escalator. At first I thought it was a bit ridiculous, but actually I can see why they need it. Having grown up with escalators I take them for granted, but I can see how they would be tricky to navigate if you weren’t used to it. I saw many people have trouble stepping on the correct moving step when boarding, and lots of time people would step off at the top and just stop right there. I even saw two kids fall, seemingly from a steady standing position. Still, though, it was annoying for us Canadian “rebels” to constantly get whistled at because we were riding backwards to talk to each other or walking down the escalator to speed up the ride. Come on, people, we have advanced escalator skills!



When it was time for the movie we met up outside the theatre entrance. There were separate entrances for guys and girls. There we were given the third degree and our bags were checked. There were bag checks and metal detectors going in to the mall, too (although they were useless because they constantly beeped and no one cared) but these checks were not for security. They were looking for cameras. I think movie pirating is a big problem here. My camera snuck through undetected, but Vanessa got caught. They made her take out her battery and check it, plus fill out all kinds of paperwork. Finally, once we were all in, the others grabbed some snacks and we headed in to the theatre. They have assigned seating at these movies, which would have been good since our group was so large, but actually this movie wasn’t very full. Anj told us that usually when the theatre is really full there is a lot of cat calling and heckling at the screen, but there wasn’t much of that during our movie. It was a much more relaxed atmosphere though with much giggling and whispering than would be acceptable at home. This was a good thing because the movie was in Hindi, so Anjali, poor thing, spent the whole film whispering translation to us. Granted, the plot wasn’t that elaborate so we could follow along fairly well on our own, but it was nice to have a guide. It was surprisingly violent! Also there were some make out scenes and a sex scene. Apparently ten years ago there wasn’t even kissing allowed in Bollywood movies, but times have clearly changed. I actually liked it a lot. The cinematography was surprisingly good – much better than the old ones you see on YouTube. It really is a huge industry here. The films are long, too. There was even an intermission in the middle!



Once the movie was finished it was time to grab rickshaws and get back to the hotel to get ready for the reception. It turns out the reception was at a different hotel, which meant that we had to negotiate transportation again. We didn’t want to take rickshaws because we would be wearing nice clothes, so we asked the hotel to call us a cab. Long story short, we ended up having to get two expensive cars at 300 ruppees each for a trip which was seriously just down the road. We were cutting it close, though, and we just needed to get there. When the cars showed up we got in and confirmed the price. Then the drivers starting saying “ohhh LE Meridian? I thought you were talking about a different hotel” then he demanded 500 rupees! At this point, Anjali lost it. We had been getting screwed by various drivers all day and she had had enough. She started yelling at the driver things like, “no! That is unacceptable! It’s just around the corner! 300 rupees was the deal! I’ve had enough of these games!” etc etc. It was actually kind of funny, especially since Anjali couldn’t speak Hindi well enough to get the words out when she was mad, so the whole tirade was in English. And if you know Anjali, you know she is really mild mannered in general so to hear her raise her voice at all was quite a change, but probably didn’t seem that intense to a bystander. Anyhow, we all calmed down, we arrived, we paid our 300 rupees and disembarked.



The hotel where the reception was held was absolutely gorgeous. I’m sure it was one of the nicest in Bangalore. Sagar was waiting in the lobby when we arrived and it was great to get a chance to chat with him. It was the first time I had been able to talk to him since he picked me up from the airport. After some more photos we thought we should leave him to his hosting duties, so we headed down to the reception. This event had even more people than the wedding, and a huge ballroom was full of chairs. We managed to score a round table at the side though, which made a nice home base. Sagar’s dad is an influential cardiologist here so there were many powerful people in attendance, including various ministers and industry leaders. This event was a lot about photos (again!) but we also did another receiving line to wish the couple our blessing. The line seemed to never end! I don’t know how many people were there, but it was a lot. There was also a ton of food. The buffet items stretched the entire wall length. We had been hoping for dancing, but the crowd was waning and still nothing had happened. There was a good band playing a mix of Indian music and western covers, but everyone seemed content to listen. We were just contemplating leaving when all of a sudden, one of Sagar’s young cousins starting busting a move (she was a great dancer!). Next thing we knew, Sagar’s DAD was breaking it down! I don’t think anyone expected that. Then even Sagar was heading over and beckoning us to follow. Now, this was exciting. I have known Sagar for four years and I have never seen him dance ONCE. Before long, everyone who was left had congregated in front of the band and a huge spontaneous dance party broke out. Sagar and Deepa looked great dancing together, and they both seemed really happy, which was nice to see. It was super fun, and our group learned some excellent new Indian dance moves. I think Jeff was the best – he fit right in!



Finally, after yet more pictures, the night came to a close. Sagar arranged for some cars to take us back to our hotel. Oh, and Sagar’s brother-in-law presented us with some Indian sweets to “take on our journey.” So nice!



We had Friday free of wedding-related activities, so we were hoping to head out of the city for a day trip. We had made friends with one of Sagar’s wedding guests the day before, and she had offered to help us book a car to take us to a National Park just outside of town since we had such difficulty arranging transportation. Everything was all set up, and for a great price. We work up, had breakfast, and got suited up for our safari adventure. The car was supposed to arrive at 9:30 for a 10am departure. Nothing at 9:30. Nothing at 10am. Nothing at 10:30… We weren’t entirely sure what to do. We didn’t have a number for the company, and we foolishly hadn’t even gotten the number of our friend. So we asked the hotel to call Sagar to ask him to call his friend to find out what the deal was. We weren’t sure who exactly the hotel spoke to, but the end result was that the person was going to try to sort things out and call us back. Thirty minutes later, still no call back! I won’t go through everything, but basically the plan changed around 15 times and it was a constant game of telephone tag and miscommunication, with Sagar’s family and his friend doing their absolute best to help us. In the end, a few hours later, we found out the car company had all of their cars booked. This was fine, as we were ready to give up anyway. By this point we were exhausted and decided to have a drink in the bar to chill out. The bar was actually pretty awesome – a hidden gem we hadn’t noticed before. It was called “Aqua bar” and it had this sweet underwater theme, complete with a wall made of saltwater fish tanks.



Finally, we were ready to leave the hotel lobby. We grabbed rickshaws to the Bangalore Palace which had been recommended to us. It turned out it was going to cost 400 rupees to go inside, including an audio guide, and not everyone was in to that. But we had come all the way there so we decided to bite the bullet and go for it. I’m really glad we did! The palace was giant and really neat. The audio guide was excellent, as well. Basically, it was a castle inspired by English architecture, used to house the local rulers during British Colonial times. There were all kinds of cool artifacts, including stools made of elephant feet and an ingenious bench which was actually a scale to weigh jockeys on. There were many old photos of palace life and exotic hunts. Quite a different time. Unfortunately it cost more than admission to be allowed to take photos, so I don’t have any pictures to share.



After the palace we wanted to head generally back to the mall from the day before, because Vanessa needed to buy a cell phone and SIM card for use during her time here. We opted to walk in order to see more of the area. It was a bit of a journey but with the help of an iPhone map that Jeff had downloaded earlier and some persistent navigation skills by Vanessa, we made it!



I have to say, the people in Bangalore are generally really great. We never get hassled here like I often do in other developing countries. No one is pulling at our arms and trying to sell us stuff, or yelling at us asking where we’re from. They’ll maybe stare a bit and we’ll exchange smiles and hellos, but that’s it. And they always are helpful when we need to ask directions. It ‘s really quite nice.



Finally, we made it to the mall and all split up to acquire food and drink. We were exhausted! Vanessa attempted to buy her cell phone but was told to come back at 5pm because the man who sells SIM cards would be back then . When we came back, we were told he would be back the next day. What?? How do you sell cell phones without SIM cards? Despite the whole area being full of cell phone shops, none had SIM cards for her. Oh well.



Next we took rickshaws to a McDonalds near our hotel. I always love to try the local cultural McDonalds specialty when I’m in a new country, and it turns out the rest of the group is the same. This McDonalds had all kinds of exotic things to try! I went for the McTikki Ackaloo (I think that’s what it was called). It was kind of like a falafel patty with peas in it, normal burger toppings, and a spicy Chiptole-type sauce. It was great! Although on first bite I forgot I wasn’t eating and normal burger and was surprised when a pea popped in to my mouth.



After MickeyDee’s we walked back to our hotel and chilled out for a few hours before heading out on the town. We wanted to check out a bar up on the 13th floor of a hotel. It was pricey, but it was a fun atmosphere and the view was great. Interestingly, the curfew for bars here is 11:30, and by 11:00 pretty much everyone had left and the lights were coming on. Time to leave! We were a bit nervous about whether we would be able to get a rickshaw back but luckily some were waiting outside. We had to pay a bit more than we probably should have, but I didn’t mind at all. We had just dropped a ton of money at that bar and it was raining and cold, so I thought that rickshaw driver totally deserved the fare.



The boys and Vanessa stayed up a bit more to finish of the “wine” from the other day, but I went back to my room to update the travelblog.



That pretty much brings us to today! Today should be really fun. We’re checking out of our hotel to head north to town where Deepa is from. I think Sagar needs to spend a night in their home as part of the ceremony, and there will be another reception there. It will be great to see a smaller town. Right now we’re just waiting for a car to come get us… we’ll see if it shows up! =)



OK, I’ve been a hermit all morning so I should probably go hang out with the others. I wonder if they’re in the Aqua bar….

How to go Muthathi from banglaore


Muthathi is about 100 kms from Bangalore via kanakapura. You have to go to Kanakapura first (60+ kms), then from kanakapura to Sathanur (18 kms) on National highway 209, from Sathanur take a left turn to Muthathi (18 kms). Bheemeswari is 5 kms from Muthathi on Halagur Road.



If you are coming from Mysore in Mallavalli road, you have to come to Halagur, from Halagur take a right turn to Bheemeshwari (20 kms), from Bheemeshwari further 5 kms to Muthathi.

Busses are frequent upto Kanakapura, but less frequent from Sathanur to Muthathi. Although one may go by bus, it is better to go by own vehicle, because there are 2-3 picnic spots 2 –3 kms before Muthathi, where you can halt. Besides if you have own vehicle you can halt at hanuman temples on the way and go to bheemeswari (5kms).
What is there to see near Muthathi


Muthathi is surrounded by hills from all sides. While going from Sathanur the road goes down steep with sharp bends from the hills 5 kms before Muthathi and again climbs up steep with hairpin bends after 7 kms on the other side (after 2 kms from Bheemeshwari) towards Halagur.

You will see nice hills view when you are on the hills 5 kms before Muthathi. The trees and environment will look like any hill station. This picture is taken on Sathanur-Muthathi road, 5 kms before Muthathi.



After this hills view, the road will go down sharp to the valley. Thereafter you will find a temple of lord Hanuman, called as Padadhara Anjaneya swami temple. This temple seems to be very popular as most passers by halt at this temple to have darshan of the lord.



After hanuman temple you will find river Kavery on the left and 2 to 3 picnic spots on the river side before reaching Muthathi. If it is a holiday or picnic hour you can see people gathering in the picnic spot. Otherwise you can recognize these picnic spots by seeing pathway going down towards river and paper plates or other such picnic materials thrown here and there.



All these picnic spots before Mthathi and Muthati itself are Kaveray river spots. These are the pictures during summer in May when there is very less water in the river. The granite bed of the river gives very attractive view.



There is another hanuman temple in Muthathi, known as Muthetharaya temple. This temple has some mythological importance. When Devi Sita was taking bath at this place, her nose stud fell down in the river. Hanuman came to the place, found the stud and returned to Sita devi. That’s why Hanuman got the name Muthetharaya here.

It was early May when we went Muthathi this time. Because of summer season, tThere was very less water in the river. We could see the beautiful black granite stones on the river bed and walk over them.

The cows and bull s in Muthathi are very beautiful having extremely long horns (more than 2 feet), pointed and sharp, looking very attractive.



While in Muthathi we saw a crowd carrying some god on their shoulders for visharjan (dipping in water). The god was sitting on a tiger and the crowd was screaming as “Govinda..Govinda..”. They kept the palki near the river and did pooja and visharjan thereafter.



After spending some time in Muthathi we went towards Bheemeshwari. Bheemeshwari is 5 kms from Muthathi. There is also another Hanuman temple called “Rama Anjaneya swami temple” (picture below) on the way and a river spot in front of the temple.



The river Kavery in front of the temple is extremely beautiful (picture below). The temple is on the right side of the road and river is on the left side (while coming from Muthathi). The place is cool and nice to take bath.



After Ramanjaneya temple you have go further for Bheemeshwari. In Bheemeshwari, you will find a temple called BheemaLingeswar Temple (below).



On the other side you will find Bheemeswari Adventure and Nature Camp and Kavery Fishing Camp. They charge 1300/- per person for day trip and much more for night halts. You have to book before hand for the nature and fishing camps.


Food and halting


There is no food (no habitation) in Bheemeswari. Although there is no good hotel in Muthathi, you can find a couple of places to take food. Besides you can get chips and cold drinks here. Sathanur is a bigger place having more places to eat, although none of them is of good standard. Kanakapura gives you many good places to eat.

We took south Indian meals at sathanur which was simple but ok. On the way back we took Masala Dosa on a better looking hotel in Kanakpura, although the taste was just OK.

There is no accommodation available in Muthathi or nearby. However, accommodation is available at Bheemeswari Jungle lodges which is expensive and not worth for people who can return back on the same day.
Summary


Thus we halted at and covered several points around muthathi which include the following.

- hills view 5 kms before muthathi

- Padadhara anjaneya swami temple

- 2 picnic spots before Muthathi

- Muthathi kavery view, the main point

- Ramanjaneya swami temple on Muthathi Bheemeswari road - the kavery view there too

- Bheema Lingeswar temple in Bheemeswari

- Bheemeswari nature camp and Kavery fishing camp (from outside only)

- Hills view 2 kms after Bheemeshwari towards halagur. The road climbs steep on the hills with hairpin bends and gives a beautiful view of the valley (picture below).


Caution and warning


Muthathi like many other Kavery water spots look very calm and quiet. But there are strong water currents in many places and crocodiles too. Although it is very attractive to bath or swim in the river, it is very dangerous to get into the water. Many people loose their lives every year in kavery baths.
Other places around


There are few other places which can be covered on the same day along with Muthathi.

- Sangama, the confluence of river Arkavati and Kavery (40+ kms from Muthathi, 95 kms from Bangalore)

- Mekedatu (45 kms from Muthathi, 100 Kms from Bangalore)

- Chunhi Falls (35 kms from Muthathi, 85 kms from Bangalore)

- Pyramid Valley (55 kms from Muthathi, 50 Kms from Bangalore)

Yikes! Days have passed since I arrived in India and this is my first blog update. That means I'll inevitably forget tons of fun tidbits as I try to cram in all the craziness of the start of this adventure. Also, it's late at night and I might just run out of steam... let's see how far I can get.

First, a little background on this trip. Basically, I'm on a break between the end of medical school and the start of residency. Most everyone I know in my class has taken the opportunity to travel to some part of the world, so I thought I would follow suit. As luck would have it, my good friend from my class, Sagar, was scheduled to get married in Bangalore, India, during this time and the dates worked out perfectly for me to make the trek. A bunch of other close friends from school are here, too. Josh, Jeff, Brodie, and Vanessa are here for pretty much my whole trip, and Anjali and Kamini met up with us for the engagement/wedding (more on that later). So overall, it's a great crew for a great adventure!

Bangalore used to be known as the Garden City of India, but now it is more famous for its tech industry. It's considered the Silicon Valley of the region and is also home to a lot of call centers. Literacy levels are really high and the English language is prevelant.

Just by chance, Vanessa and I booked ourselves on the same flights from Toronto to Bangalore. The trip was pretty smooth and generally uneventful. We stumbled upon Mike and Matt, also from our class, in the departures lounge at YYZ, though, because the poor guys had been delayed over 12 hours trying to get to London. Luckily we didn't have anything like that on our trip! The big hiccup for me was the lack of internet access in Frankfurt during our stopover. Honestly, what major airports don't have internet access these days? I had a bunch of emails I needed to send and reply to which I didn't get to before I left (it was a WHIRLWIND week prior to departure, with writing my medicince licensing exam, a marathon weekend of Scouts Board meetings, conducting interviews for a hiring committee, and then signing lease papers and sending money for my new place in Calgary). I have an even longer stop over there on the way back. Wasted time frustrates me.

We arrived in Bangalore at 00:30. We were pretty sure that someone was going to meet us at the airport, but we didn't know exactly who or where or... much (this would be a recurring theme). But once we landed I texted Brodie and he said they were waiting for us, and sure enough, after exiting the airport we had Jeff, Josh, Brodie, and Sagar all there to welcome us with big hugs! What troopers - it was like 1:30am by the time we left and the trip back to the hotel took about 45 minutes. We had two cars: one was driven by a hired driver but Sagar drove the other one himself. If you could see the roads here you would know how impressive that is! At least traffic is way reduced at night time. The other car actually got lost, but we all made it to our hotel eventually. I had slept great on the plane from Frankfurt, but I had not trouble sleeping well in my hotel bed once I settled in, too. I think I have two years of sleep deprivation to correct (before I get started on the next five years of sleep deficit!).

The next morning (or, I suppose, later that same morning) we woke and had an excellent breakfast at the hotel. They have a huge breakfast buffet every morning which is included with our stay. It's a neat mix of Indian foods and sort of western breakfast foods, but everything has a bit of a twist. Overall, though, it's good and we really fill up to start our day. My one complaint is that the coffee certainly leaves something to be desired... ah well.

Our next challenge was to get Anjali from the airport. She was arriving at 12:30 in the afternoon on a domestic flight from Dehli where she has been staying with family for the last two weeks. That turned out to be a bit of a challenge. Sagar had arranged for another car to pick Vanessa and I up from the hotel to go to the airport to grab Anj and bring her back. The problem was, I felt the timeline was pretty tight because the airport is at LEAST 45 minutes away, more with traffic, and the car was supposed to get us at noon, get Anj, come back to the hotel, then we were supposed to go meet Kamini across town for lunch before massage appointments at 3pm. If you are confused, you are still not experiencing the level of chaos that was experienced that afternoon. Basically, Anj had arrived at the airport and still no car had shown up at the hotel to get me and Vanessa. We would discover this would soon be a reoccuring theme. The other issue was that without an Indian mobile (cell phone) we have a terrible time communicating with anyone. So when the car didn't come we had to get the hotel to call Sagar's mobile, which they were hesitant to do for us (only some of the hotel staff are helpful. We have now figured out which ones are the enablers and which ones are to be avoided) to figure out what to do. Much texting was going on through a web-based text service because Anjali had wifi at the Bangalore airport, but we were paying for wifi by the hour at our hotel. So we would text Anjali and attempt to call Sagar multiple times, and it was all very confusing. Eventually Anjali just worked up the courage to take a taxi by herself to the hotel. It worked out find. Oh, meanwhile we were doing the same web-based texting to Kamini, who was wondering what the heck was going on. Kamini's aunt and uncle live in Bangalore so she has been here many times. In fact, her parents were visiting right now, as well.

So, basically, Anjali arrived, ditched her stuff in Vanessa's room, and then we attempted to get to the restaurant where we were supposed to meet Kamini and the other boys (they had headed out on their own for some exploring earlier). We asked the hotel to call us a taxi, and when a car arrived we got it. As we were pulling away we tried to confirm the rate but the driver started quoting crazy prices. He wanted us to pay to hire him for 4 hours, but we only wanted a one-way trip. There was much frustration and fighting and Anjali arguing in broken Hindi (she lived in India from ages 3-5) which eventually culminated in us asking to be brought back to hotel. So, that was transportation fail number 2 for the day. It turns out that was a bit of a miscommunication and now we know the difference between a metered taxi and hiring a driver. The hotel clearly has a vested interest in hiring cars because they constantly push us to get them, even though we don't need or want that. Finally we got a metered cab (again, after craziness but I won't get in to it) and headed off. We texted the driver's mobile number to Kamini before we left the wifi zone of the hotel, and she had someone call him to give directions. It took convicing to get the driver to pick up the phone because he didn't understand what was going on, but eventually he did. Miraculously, we ended up in front of the restaurant, I and Monkey, for a very reasonable 200 rupees. Phew!

By this time, we were really late. It was almost 3:00 and the restaurant was closing at that time, plus we were supposed to be at the spa then. Luckily the boys had only just arrived, themselves, because their rickshaws had no idea where to go. It turns out that Kamini's whole extended family was there and that her uncle knows the owner, so they were lenient and stayed open a bit later for us. The food and service were fantastic! A cold beer was nice after the stress of the day, as well. As an added bonus, when we got up to leave we found out that Kamini's family had taken care of the bill for us - so kind! Even better, they had left us two cars and drivers to get where we needed to go. The boys went shopping while us girls went off to a little local salon that Kamini knows well.

I would never in a million years have known about that place myself because it really was just a business out of someone's house on a small side street, but the ladies there cared about their work and paid a lot of attention to detail for a very reasonable price. I had my first mani/pedi, which was... interesting. The manicure was nice, but I'm really not that into people getting that invested in my feet, I think. I may not get another opportunity to have a manicrue, however, because soon I'll be starting surgical training and you can't have nailpolish on when you scrub in to surgery. Flakes of laquer are not good things to get in a surgical field! I had been hoping for a massage, as well, but I didn't really have time in the end because the other girls were finished up their treatments and I didn't want to hold up the group.

From there we swung by an Indian clothing shop because I wanted to get an Indian outfit for the engagment party that night. Sagar's family had purchased all of us beautiful Indian clothing for the wedding, but I kind of wanted to wear something different for the engagement (Anjali had a bunch of outfits to choose from and Vanessa was borrowing something from Kamini, but I'm about twice the size of them so I was on my own). Kamini said the shop we were going to had really well priced stuff so it would be a quick win. Well, it turns out times had changed since the last time she was there! I went to try on a long shirt and pants which was * nice * but not a dream garmet of mine or anything, and took a look at the pricetag in the changeroom. It said 7000 rupees. I stood there for a while thinking that jet lag or something must be prohibiting my conversion skills. How could this cotton shirt cost 7000 rupees? I must be missing a decimal or something. I came out with the outfit on and asked Kamini how much 7000 rupees was. She was like, ""I don't know... $150 or something. Why?"" ""Because that's how much this costs!!!"" ""WHAT??!?!"" She exclaimined. ""OK, well just take it off and let's get out of here! That's crazy!""

Anjali was shocked, too. She said we could by the same thing for $30 in Toronto. We're not talking silk sari or anything... this was just a cotton long shirt and pants with some embroidary embellisment. We are told that times have changed in the last few years. As Bangalore, and, presumably, India in general, has boomed the divide between upper-middle class and poor has increasingly widened. There has been an increased emphasis on material goods and prices have risen accordingly. Basic silk saris cost hundreds of dollars now.

I decided to wear a western dress from home to the engagment party.

Before heading to the hotel and the party, we swung by Kamini's aunt's house so that she and Vanessa could get dressed in their saris and we could have some tea. They looked gorgeous, but my goodness they were a production to put on! It starts with a small crop top (the blouse) and a long skirt which ties up (the petticoat). These are basically foundation garments. Then a single gigantic piece of cloth is tucked in to the top of the petticoat and wrapped around the wearer multiple times. Finally, it is brought up and around the shoulder, pleated, and pinned up. That probably sounds more simple than it actually is. Kamini's mom had to help and at times there were two people involved in the pleating and pinning. Apparantly they are very hot and heavy, as well.

Finally, we headed back to the hotel so Anjali and I could get dressed. Here, the clothing ordeals continued. I slipped in to my dress no problem, but Anjali had a wardrobe malfunction. She was wearing a long Indian dress/shirt (I should really know the names for these things) which had one of those small zippers running down the side which always gets caught. It continually got stuck and we could NOT get it to go down. The worst part was that it was sticking near the top, so basically one whole side of her outfit was gapping open. Poor Anj was determined to wear that dress, though, because it had long sleeves and here arms were COVERED in terrible mosquito bites from Dehli, some of which had actually blistered! So, we tried and tried to get that zipper down, unsure of what we were missing downstairs because events were already supposed to have started at this point. With Anjali's arm raised over her head, Vanessa, Kamini, and I all worked away, pulling at various parts of armpit fabric and zipper, trying to close the seam. It was actually rather hilarious. Eventually brute force prevailed and the zipper went down, but the upper part split open. Oh well. 80% was closed. Now, though, we needed a pin to secure that part to make sure no other part of the zipper seam pulled open. Kamini and Vanessa had safety pins on their saris, but they were serving important functions and they couldn't be given up. No one else had any pins of any kind. After a search my bag and hotel room, I managed to find one straight pin and a small ""BEAVERS CANADA"" pin with a safety pin style back. Anj was desperate at this point, so the BEAVERS CANADA pin was employed. If someone looked closely, they would have been rather confused with the latest accessories from Canada.

Finally, we were ready to head down to the engagement party and meet up with the boys. I guess I haven't said much about it yet, but this is an arranged marriage that Sagar is entering in to. He met his wife-to-be for the first time in December when he went home to India for a week. They were then going to get engaged through an elaborate ceremony this night and be married the next day. Short, so no time to back out, I guess!

It turns out we hadn't missed much. Apparently Indian wedding ceremonies are fairly fluid events where people kind of come and go throughout. This ceremony was in very full, hot room. There was a traditional band playing in the corner and Sagar and Deepa were on a beautiful stage with flowers all around. There were also big time bright lights with two video cameras and two still photographers - one set for each side of the family. The evening consisted of a lot of blessings and a LOT of photographers. Everyone was dressed beautifully in outfits shimmering with every colour of the rainbow. Sagar's family is extremely nice and made us always feel welcome and taken care of. His sister and her husband are especially great. They had recently done fellowships at McGill so they have a good handle of what our ""norms"" are and take care of us when we look confused. They are both doctors, as is Sagar's father. In fact, there are 17 doctors in their family! We know we have nothing to worry about while we are here. Many guests wanted to speak with us and find out what brought us all the way here from Canada, and they, in turn, explained parts of the ceremony to us.

After eating a delicious Indian buffet dinner we got a chance to give our blessings to the engaged couple. This involved us going barefoot up on the stage and waving a platter with lighted candles and fresh flowers around in a circle. Then we touched the rim of the candle holders with our finger and then touched the finger to the forehead of each Sagar and Deepa.

Eventually we snuck off to our rooms as things were winding down. The boys had attempted to acquire some booze earlier in the day for us. They did well on the beer (""Kingfisher"" beef is ubiquitous here) but we had requested wine, and that was more difficult. When they told their driver they needed wine they were taken down an alley and dropped off in front of an enclosed cage with a small window. They asked for wine and a jug of ""local"" wine was produced. It was kind of sketchy, and fortified. They boys bought three jugs. Haha. So, that night we tried the wine. It was.... terrible. How were we going to drink 3 litres of this stuff! We tried mixing it with some soda water and that made it slightly more bareable. Eventually we discovered it was more tolerable if we stopped thinking of it as wine and more as just miscellanous alcohol. I still wasn't a huge fan, but tonight (2 nights later) the last jug was finished off. I never thought we would do it.

The next day was the wedding in the morning, followed by a reception in the evening. I hope I get to write about it all but time is marching on! I should get a chance for some more writing tomorrow morning because we will probably have a bunch of time waiting for a car to pick us up (we are going up north to Deepa's village for a continuation of the marraige ritual stuff). I should probably stop here for tonight because it's almost 2am and we have a big day tomorrow. I have TONS of pictures. I'll try to get those up tomorrow, too. Goodnight for now!

After having a wonderful first half clicking around at The Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary, I returned to my hotel room in Mysore. I still had the rest of the day to explore some more places in and around Mysore. I recalled, some years ago when I was living in Bangalore, I had a friend from Tibet, Kalsang. Once he mentioned about Bylakuppe, one of the largest Tibetan settlement in India and the beautiful monasteries around. My brain clicked and I checked with the Hotel reception immediately.



‘How far is Kushalnagar?’, I asked.



‘Almost 2 hours’ drive from here’, hotel manager replied.



‘Thank you’, I disconnected the intercom.



Within 10 minutes I had my camera ready and I walked down to the City bus stand in Mysore. I love Karnataka not only for its beautiful destinations but also ‘The
Photo 10
Best’ transport connectivity in India. I was asking around about the buses to Kushalnagar. One guy pointed out to platform no. 3. I gradually walked to the platform no. 3 and I saw almost 5 buses were ready to start immediately. To go to Kushalnagar, one has to take a bus to Madikeri.



‘Kushalnagar?’ I asked.



‘Hop in’, conductor nodded.



In next 10 minutes I was enjoying the beautiful and clean city streets of Mysore. And in next 20 minutes I was cruising through Bangalore-Madikeri Road. The first big stop was at Hunsuru, a big sub divisional town in Karnataka. The turf between Mysore to Hunsuru was just a paradise to all the cruisers and my



KSRTC 'Bus man' did live up to my expectation. The bus halted here for about 5 minutes and hit the road again. The road between Hunsuru to Kushalnagar took almost an hour and half and was so scenic that I was enjoying every bit of it. I was travelling with a Monk and his granddaughter. He was telling me the stories of Bylakuppe and the monasteries. The bus was roaring at the
Photo 2
top gears and climate was cozy enough to enjoy every moment of it. I was thinking about my next line of plans. This extension of Coorg is really eye pleasing. Lush green terrains, long winding roads, Aromas like fresh morning glory and drive



Amidst coffee and pepper plantations which was aplenty. Around 4pm the bus dropped me at Kushalnagar bus stand. This place seemed to me like any other district town in Karnataka with all sort of modern amenities available. I was gazing around in search of a vehicle to drive me to Bylakuppe which was merely 2 and half miles away from Kushalnagar. I walked out of the bus stand and found a fellow in mid-forties waiting with his three wheelers.



'Bylakuppe?', I asked



'Golden Temple?', He asked further



'Yes sir',I replied



'30 rupees sir', he said



'Let’s go’, I hoped in.



Upon asking his name, he said, ‘Ayub'. He took a diversion from the freeway and was asking about my whereabouts and reason for visiting this place. I got his 'between the lines' that he was trying
Photo 12
to clinch a deal. I got the point and asked him straight.



'How many temples are here apart from the Golden Temple?'



'Sir, there are 4 more', he replied.



'And how much you are going to squeeze out of my pocket if I would make a visit to all four of them’, I offered him a deal.



'Sir, there is a long trip for 4 monasteries that would cost around Rs.400 and there is a short trip of 4 monasteries which would be lesser, Rs.250',He got me thinking.



I couldn't understand his offer. If there are four monasteries how come there are 'long and short' trips. Is he planning to rip me? I sank deep in my thoughts. He realized his answer was a kind of a riddle to me which I was playing a hard ball to decode. He went further describing the details.



'Sir, apart from The Golden Temple, there are four more monasteries. Sera Je, Sera Mey, Kagyu and a newly built one. If you would like to visit all four except Kagyu which eventually isolated from the others,
Photo 13
would cost you Rs.250. Makes sense?'



I got his point, but to let others understand him in a better way, there are 5 monasteries in this Bylakuppe-Kushal Nagar Sector. Namdroling (Which is known as the Golden Temple to the locals), Sera Jey, Sera Mey, Kagyu and a newly constructed one which neither him nor I was sure about the name. I was thinking what to do as it was almost 4:30pm and I eventually picked up an overcast day which would mean that the sunlight won't be available much longer to make good shots. I asked him to drop Kagyu this time and clinched the 'short deal' with Rs. 250/-. He seemed to be happy enough with that too.



Drive from Kushalnagar to Bylakuppe was through narrow city lanes and didn't take more than 20 minutes to reach The Golden Temple. Unlike my other tours, I found a bit of a crowd here as being a public holiday, people from faraway places decided to take a short diversion to this place enroute Madikeri, Coorg. Other than that I didn't feel anyone has any sort interest in Monasteries or how the monks lead their lives
Photo 5
here. A typical South Indian crowd who really got messed up this place with any other Hindu Temple and was trying a make a fuss here.I love visiting monasteries mostly for the peaceful environment and tidiness which really a 'big miss' in any other Hindu Temple. I walked inside and found a 'Big Hostel' kind of building to me left, indeed that was the place where the monks live. I walked further ahead and found that entire campus was huge and maintained with utmost creativity and serenity. I moved ahead to the main temple after clicking a few more shots. The main Buddha Idol was almost 80 feet tall and was crafted with a lot of colorful impressions. In front of the idol a natural sphere was tried to project and it was done with utmost neutrality that I could see a few birds were enjoying this wonderful place as well. As usual the 'messed up' tourists were trying to create a mess with packs of 'Frito Lays' and 'Gooddays'. I was really getting my 'apples hot' so decided to walk out of this place immediately. I was feeling pity for the monks that their purpose of practicing meditation really
Photo 14
went for the day for these ‘immature’ tourists out there. I tried to pose a few shots with monks and they seemed to very humble people with a smile on their face always. Time was running out for me and I had 3 more to visit. Ayub was waiting for me and he clutched his ""Merc"" faster to Sera Je. Once we drove out of The Golden Temple, I found that the bunch of tourists were not following this route which gave me a slight indication that their ""diversion"" was just for the Golden Temple not for the other monasteries here. From Namdorling to Sera Je may be a mile's drive and yes ! I was the only person to enjoy the serenity. I interacted with a few more monks and tried to learn about their routines and how they feel staying furthest from home. I really liked their answers and yes, with a smile always. After spending sometime in Sera Je and Sera Mei I saw a small Tibetan Restaurant just outside the Sera Mei monastery. I realized that I didn't have a bite of grains to eat since morning. I was more curious to have 'Momo','Fing Sha' and
Photo 15
'Tingmo' after some years. I asked Ayub whether these monks allow other tourists to stay in their hostels then I could give it a try for a night. He said that they usually don't but if I say I was just alone and would like to do some research, they might allow. I got his trick again. I spoke with one of the main administrators of the Sera Mei monastery and almost begged with utmost innocence to spend one night at the hostel. Since I was born I realized that my innocent face was the key to my success. My job, my marriage everything went hassle-free because of my innocence and here I was a 'no exceptional' as well. I asked Ayub bhai to return to Kushal Nagar and to pick me up at the early am next day. Rest of the evening I spent time roaming around the places and sharing my travelling experiences with the monks. Since being requested by the administrator, I am not sharing the routines and the other 'High profile but sensitive' discussions about Tibet and the Tibetans.



I had a wonderful dinner with the monks and it was Momos,Tingmo and Shapta.
Photo 16
I was feeling like being in heaven. One thing for sure, I need to visit this



Place quite often. It's not a 'one time' place to come, see and leave but a place which would give strength to your lungs to breath afresh. I am in love with this place. However, unwillingly I woke up with Ayub bhai's honk, next day around 7am. After expressing my sincere thanks and gratitude to the monks whom I



Befriended with during my stay in Bylakuppe for just more than 16 hours. I am sure that the bunch of tourists seeking their 'Vacation' will not visit this place as it has nothing but the 'music of traquility,peace and harmony' which I may have longed for years. Love you Bylakuppe. God bless all !!!

Mid river swimming, Dandeli
NORTH KARNATAKA

Mumbai – Dandeli – Sirsi – Yana-Hampi – Pattadakal – Badami – Aihole – Bijapur – Mumbai 20th – 25th March’2012

We left Mumbai by Mangalore Expresses at 10.15 pm scheduled to reach Karwar next day 8.30 am. The idea was to start our North Karnataka tour from Karwar with plans to enjoy about 2-3 hours of para-gliding and other beach activities at Deobagh Resort, Karwar in the morning before proceeding further. However the train reached about 2 hours late forcing us to drop the idea and head straight for Dandeli by road.

Lesson 1 learnt :- Kokan Railway operates on only one track and thus invariably trains run late, so keep enough time margin on hand.

For going to Dandeli from Mumbai, better is to embark at Londa Station which is just about 38 kms from Dandeli. Your Dandeli hotel would invariably arrange for a pickup at a small cost or local taxis are available just outside both Londa or Karwar station for Dandeli.
Day 1



Karwar – Dandeli is about 112 kms but took us more than 4 ½ hours as about 25 kms of road in between is extremely
Crocodiles in Dandeli river
bad, almost non-existent! Even though this is supposed to be a state highway, apparently the forest department is holding back permission for rebuilding of road due to ecological reasons as it passes through forest. But hello- somebody enlighten me, what is bad for ecology and pollution and noise creation and vehicle maintenance? Number of vehicles traveling remaining same (as everybody is forced to take this road, it being a state highway actually), vehicles traveling smoothly in 4th gear or vehicles forced to travel in 1st / 2nd gear for over a distance of 25 kms!

Our booking was at Kali Adventure camp run by Jungle Lodge & Resorts and was for riverside facing tents.

Tip :- When booking, ask for tent number 3,4, 5 as they offer best river view.

The booking is on per person basis, two sharing a tent which actually is a kind of permanent structure with attached bathroom. Gives you fairly an adventurous atmosphere without sacrificing the comforts we city people are accustomed to!

The booking includes all food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) , 2 hours jungle safari (choice between morning 5.30 am and evening 4 pm safaris), coracle (round traditional boat) ride
River Rafting, Dandeli
in river. The food is on buffet basis and quality is Ok. The evening fish curry made from freshly caught Katla fish from the river was excellent with high local spicy tang.

People mainly go to Dandeli for river rafting. A 9 km rafting is provided in the river Kali and the rapids are not very “rapids” means everybody can do it. Apparently they are not even as strong as Kolad near Mumbai (though Dandeli is definitely more scenic), forget the north Indian Himalayan river rapids.

Tip – As the river water flow is controlled by hydroelectric Dam nearby, best season to enjoy would be just after monsoons when river would be naturally gushing through. At other times, specially summer times, you are at the mercy of the dam (no pun intended) people. So the moment you land at your Dandeli hotel, first check for Water flow and immediately book, don’t wait for next day. Who knows next day no water might be released from the dam to the river and thus no river rafting!

Luckily the day we reached, there was a good water flow and thus we had a quick lunch and headed straight for
River Rafting, Dandeli
rafting. The total time involved is about 3 and half hours as the rafting starts from a place called Ganeshguddi, about 20 odd kms away inside forest. Rafting charges are not included in the hotel package and currently the rate is Rs 1300 per person. The hotel arranges for the tour including pick up and drop in a jeep to the rafting point.

The rafting experience begins first with a lecture on safety precautions to be taken in case of emergency (yes, accidents do happen, in front of us about 4 passengers fell off another boat in the 9th rapid, nobody was hurt). One is provided with a helmet and life jacket (so knowing swimming is not a requirement for rafting!). Jeans, heavy clothing are not allowed as when wet, they tend to drag you down if you fall in water. Best is half pants and Tshirt.

The boat navigator is an experienced person (ours was an imported one all the way from Nepal) and guides you well. About 8 – 10 people are in a boat and first thing after reaching mid river is an order to jump into the river! This is mainly to drive away
Dandeli Forest Drive
fear of water from those who don’t know swimming. Your life jacket allows you to stay afloat, so go ahead without fear and jump. Also another staff is always there in a kayak alongside ready to help anybody requiring help.

Swimming in a flowing mid river is definitely a high adrenalin stuff. More so when the your guide quietly informs everyone that there are crocodiles in the river! No joke, we actually saw two , quietly basking on one of the river small islands. Apparently the crocodiles are satisfied with whatever fish they get in the river to bother any human beings sloshing around in the water. No human has ever been bitten / eaten by any crocodile in this river as per the locals.

So after some swimming around in the river, you are pulled back in the boat by the guide (pulling back in the boat is an art by itself, try pulling a guy weighing upwards of 80 kgs, straight out of water in a boat) and now its showtime, the rafting is about to begin.

First the guide asks all the rowers to pool together their paddles and do a high five with
Coracle ride, Dandeli
them and asks them to shout out “Jack Ali”! Faithfully everybody shouts out Jack Ali. Jack Ali? Did I hear it right, was it some kind of national integration programme involving people from different religions? I couldn’t resist and asked him again to speak it out slowly and now he says “Jai Kali”, the river is kali river and by saying it you are paying your respects to the river to protect you. So from where this Jack Ali thing has come? Well, it is just pronounced that way for the benefit of the foreigners!

There are total of 9 rapids in the stretch , the first and last are best, the in betweens are rather tame once you have experienced the very first one. There is an “onboard” professional photographer who frequently gets down on river islands to take your snaps in action. Charges Rs 500 for it, worth it, go for it as you yourself are in no position to take your own photos while rafting.

Its late evening by the time you come back to the resort but a nice surprise awaits you there, campfire accompanied by unlimited hot pakoras and chicken tandoori barbqued right
Sahasralinga river bed
in front of you (part of the package, no extra charge, tho that does spoil your dinner lit bit later on) . Bring your own bottles if you want to enjoy more (offitially not allowed but everybody had brought one and kept hidden in paper bags!). There is a reasonably priced bar but it offers very limited range, even Bacardi was not available.

Day 2

Woken up by staff at 5 for morning for jungle safari drive.

Tip :- If river water flow is not constraint, do rafting in morning and jungle safari in afternoon as morning jungle safari was too foggy when we went. Jungle being absolutely thick, you could hardly see deep inside or get the apparently excellent view of mountain valley side.

Morning air was quite chilly and cold even though it was start of summer, so if you are going in monsoons or winter, be prepared with heavy woolens.

There are apparently about 50 odd black leapords in Dandeli apart from tigers, but as always you need all the luck on your side to spot any of them. We had to be content only with their foot prints but we did
Yana Rock formations
see bison, jackal, deers, snakes and variety of exotic jungle birds.

Back from safari, had a nice breakfast and headed for river in front for a Coracle ride. Coracle, a round traditional boat made from bamboo is supposed to be so sturdy that it can carry 8 people and in villages it is used to carry even motorcycles across .

The boatman takes you around for about half hour ride to a nearby river island where crocodiles come for basking. If you are brave enough, he will help you to actually get down on the island for a photo opportunity (we did).

We had booked only for one day , it was time for us to check out . It might be a good idea to actually stay for two days, one day for pure relaxation. However two things, the resort is not in deep jungle as one expects it to be and second it is bit overpriced for the kind of facility and food offered (Rs 2,950 per person per day for tent accomodation). However the staff is very friendly and helpful. The counter got us extremely reasonable priced excellent taxi for further 5 days trip.
Yana Rock formations


Tip : You can get very cheap rates at Kulgi forest camp (Rs 400 per night) but it is actually nowhere deep in the forest, so unless you have your own vehicle, it may not be right choice plus apparently it requires advance reservation from Forest department which till last moment we couldn’t get (or didn’t know how to get all the way from Mumbai). Also not sure whether rafting and jungle safari can be organized from there, your own vehicles are not allowed inside the jungle.

Checked out around 11 as we had a long planned road journey. The plan was to go to Sirsi, Yana and stay for the night at Jog Falls. Got a good rate from the resort for a Ford Toofan ( a 10 seater) , very spacious and comfortable vehicle, the guy charged us only Rs 7.50 per km, not aircoditioned, (minimum 300 kms a day) plus Rs 100 per night driver allowance, a steal for us when compared with rates for other vehicles. We booked it for next 5 days.

Headed straight for Sirsi, about 80 odd kms from Dandeli. About 15 kms before Sirsi is Sahstralinga. As the name
Entrance to Yana cave
suggests, there are hundreds of big and small shiv lingas carved on boulders in a river bed.

The story goes that few hundred years back, local king Nayakan 1 did not have son, heir to his throne. The court astrologer told him to do shiva puja by constructing 1001 shiv lingas. Hence the river bed is filled with them (sahsra is thousand), though now the big ones have got broken off over the years maybe due to flowing debris in flooded river during monsoon. So if you want to see them, monsoon may not be a good time as they would be submerged in high river water level. Be prepared to wade through the river to see them and huge carved bulls alongside.

It is not known whether all this construction of shiv lingas cured the problem in the king’s linga and he getting his much desired heir. But definitely worth a visit . Right side of the car park, a path goes to a hanging bridge from which you can watch the river flow by below.

From there, we proceeded to Yana, another 60 odd kms.

Tip :-Road to Yana goes through absolutely thick impenetrable
600 steps climb up Angini Mountain
jungle, most of it totally isolate except for one or two villages in between. So plan yourself such a way that you must reach there latest by 3 pm so that you can head out back to civilization by 5 - 6 pm, i.e. before sun goes down.

Yana is nature’s wonder. Huge towering rock structures, apparently carved due to impact of flowing rainwater over them over millions of years. From car parking, you have to walk down for about a km and half in a forest path and suddenly it opens in front of you.

There is a 800 year old shiva temple inside a cave below one of the rock structure. The cave has running water from a stream bringing water deep inside from mountain. Apparently regardless of whether it is summer or heavy monsoon, the water flow remains constant and volume doesn’t ever change.

Around the temple, you can go round through a natural opening in the rock structure. For climbing up , proper staircase have been made but for coming down, its still rough path, So not advisable for elderly people. But for others, definitely worth a visit. Religious people go around taking
Angini mountain top, Hampi
it as a pradikshna (going around) the temple. You are not allowed to wear footwear so be ready to get some painful jabs from stones. But don’t miss it for such flimsy reasons. As I said, it’s a nature wonder. Going up and back down again takes about 20 odd minutes for young fast people though we took almost an hour enjoying the rock structure inside.

Back to civilization but at Sirsi we were informed that going to Jog falls (highest waterfall of India?) would be futile as the water flow is controlled by dam on top and as per the local person, at this time of the year (March) and till monsoon, a cow pees more water than the water flowing in the falls. So we decided to drop Jog falls and head for Hubli for the night stay.

This meant long drive of about 125 kms and we reached Hubli at about 9 pm, dead tired. Nothing to see or do in Hubli, only a night halt against our earlier planned night halt at Jog water falls.
Day 3


Started from Hubli and went to Hampi (110 kms), the glorius capital of Vijaynagara empire, now
Sunset atop Angini Mountain, Hampi
a World Heritage site.

Hampi is in two parts with Tungabhadra river flowing through in between. Modernisation has taken its toll and now the nostalgic coracle boat ride across is replaced by motor boat. While all the main ruins are on the side of Hampi village, the other side, actually an island in the river, offers wonderful staying facilities.

We decided to go across and stay at the island, planned it as a rest day.

Tip : The boat to Hampi island stops at 6 pm and there is nothing available for crossing the river after that, so be planned and careful. There is alternative road 35 kms long to reach the island from Hampi village while the boat crossing hardly takes 10 minutes, so makes sense to park your vehicle on this side and take the boat across if you want to stay on the island or visit the sites on other side. The other side had lines of back packer resorts one after another, all targeted at firang backpacker crowd. We enquired at few places and finally settled at Mowgli Resort. What a good decision that turned out to be. It offers river facing hut
Queen's Summer Palace Hampi
styled rooms , neat and clean, food was great. There are khatiyas (wood and coir beds) and swings in front of each hut and you could just laze through on them whole day. Even the dining area offers a separate floor sitting area under the trees and lined with cushions where you can have old Indian style floor sitting lunch / dinner. And all this is very reasonable priced (Rs 600 for a river facing hut having a double bed and attached bathroom), the room rates were much lower than next door resorts offering same kind of stuff. Though apparently season time (Oct – Feb) rates go upto Rs 2000 per hut.

Tip – Hampi off season is from April – August, actually some of the hotels close down during these months simply because the temperature crosses 45* C and since all the sites are in open, you would be spending whole day out in blazing sun.

Best is to go at March end or Aug-Sept , i.e just before or just after offseason so that you get best of the rates, atmosphere has improved and avoid the season crowd.

Late afternoon we tied up with a
Housing for Royal elephants
rickshaw to go around the island side. The standard rickshaw charges for a 3 hour ride around is Rs 350 – 400 and for a Tata Magic Rs 650 .

Tip – Don’t bother to take this ride, compared to what is offered on main Hampi side , this side has hardly anything worth seeing except for two things, both of which you can actually walk through if you love long walks.

The first thing is for the religious minded, Pampa sarovar, this lake finds its mention in old hindu mythology. Apparently this was where Ram came during his long 14 year old vanvas and met Shabri (the one who offered berries to him). His footprints are still there in the temple there. The name Pampa later became Hampa and then Hampi, the modern name of the place. The lake is full of brilliant white lotus flowers.

The second thing is for both religious as well as normal tourist, Angini mountain. For normal tourist , climb up this mountain is must as top offers a fantastic view of entire Hampi. Absolute must for everyone to watch sunset from there. On top , there is kind of flat
Arches in Queen's palace
top and you can sit on any of the big boulders to watch the sunset. Any day, there would be scores of people up there for it (mainly whites, don’t know why there was no Indian except us). There are about 600 odd steps (properly made) to climb up, takes about 30 - 45 minutes to climb up.

Now for the religious people and the answer to why 600 odd proper steps have been made to reach top. On top is a Hanuman temple, its birth place of Hanuman! This is where his mother Angini met his father Vayu. And from there the name, Angini Parbat.

After watching the sunset and visit to the temple, climb down and back to the resort for a well deserved round of drinks and wonderful dinner, unfortunately the resort has only a beer license!
Day 4


Cross over to main Hampi by boat and have a guide for full day. If you really want to see and understand Hampi, a full day guide is must. Depending on who they think you are, the asking rates differ between Rs 800 and 2000. One fellow asked for Rs 1500 and refused to bargain
Narsimha statue , Hampi
even at the cost of loosing us! Finally we found another (good one ) for Rs 800 (go to tourist information office for it, just opposite main car park).

Hampi was definitely one of the golden days of India, after Chandragupta and Ashoka empires. To see it fully, atleast 2 to 3 days are required but we settled for one and half days. The ruins tell the stories of how rich , culturally / artistically / financially India was in those days.

Vijayanagara empire lasted about 200 odd years from 1450 to 1650 AD and Hampi got built over this time, massive temples, palaces, markets. They had gold and precious stones market 700 meteres long in front of the main temple, the makets attracted business people from Iran, Greece, Arabia, Chinese , not forgetting the Europeans. Each of these nationalities have been carved in their exact details on the temple walls showing some business dealings (like horse buying etc)

Virupaksha temple is main temple, even during those days pin camera concept was there and you can see it inside the main temple where the inverted image of 20 storied high gopuram (temple tower) is seen on a
Ganesha, Hampi
wall, with zero degree correctly marked (point where image inverts). On the roof there are 3 D carvings of various mythological stories. These are painted with paint still retained.

The other main temple constructed was Vithala Temple, a huge complex about 12 kms away, you are taken inside by battery operated vehicle (to avoid pollution damage to sites) run by ladies only (all employed under Rural Employment generation Scheme of governement). This temple was constructed when Vithala Statue was brought over from Pandharpur (about 800 kms away) when Pandharpur was attacked by muslim rulers of Bijapur. Apparently after bringing over the statue, the king found success in whatever he did and as gratitude, built this massive complex. It has a stone chariot whose wheels still run, though now they have been glued to floor as people did nothing but keep revolving this!

Whole temple is built on Vaastu shastra concept and your guide (if he is good and knowing) will explain you those concept and once you see it , you understand why the Vaastu shastra principles are what they are.

The temple has both south Indian and north Indian temple styles signifying the vastness of empire
Stone Chariot ,Hampi Vithala Temple
of vijaynagara empire. It has even a sun temple style konarka , Orissa way.

Main attraction of this temple was sangeet mahal, a 57 pillared structure. Each of these pillar (about 2 storied high) was made from a single stone and carved in such a way, that a musican could actually use his hand to play a particular musical instrument on it. Means when he tapped his fingers on it a particular way, it would emit sound of that particular instrument like tamboora, tabla, pakhawaj etc. Apparently those days , no actually musical instrument was used in the temple, the whole music was generated by these pillars only. Its not allowed now to be shown at Sangeet mahal pillars (whatever remaining there are), but your guide will show (play) the music at a smaller adjoining hall with smaller pillars.

There are carvings which are kind 2 in 1 and 5 in 1 etc, means same carving when you see from different angle seem different. So two in one is like elephant from one angle and bull from other angle. The guide covers different parts of the carving one by one to show the different kind

The other
City Water Tank, Hampi
thing worth seeing in Hampi are ofcourse the 20 - 30 odd high feet two huge gansha statues (much damaged) and narsimha statue (sort of reassembled now), they are really huge and made from one single block, one wonders at the carvers imagination and skill to carve out these gigantic structures.with minutest details. One of the ganesha statues when looked from front is pot bellied ganesha, but from behind looks like a lady sitting with her back, the hair style, curve of waist unmistakable. The explanation apparently is that from back it is supposed to be goddes parvati having her son ganpati sitting on her lap in the front.

The other palace worth seeing is the queens palace which was the palace for queens when their husbands would go out for long drawn battles etc. It has a natural airconditioned palace where water used to get dropped at the top of the third floor and then flowed down all around bringing in the coolness inside. There is an elephant area outside capable of holding 11 royal elephants, one dome for each elephant and each dome has got a different architecture and design.

Unfortunately mid sixteenth century, the king
Pattadakal Temple comlex
fell in love with his court dancer and on her advice, appointed her brother to a high court position. The dancer and her brother were actually spies for muslim rulers of Bijapur and over next few months, collected all the vital military secrets of Hampi.

Based on this knowledge, Hampi was attacked by Bijapur around 1650 AD and over a period of six months, they systematically destroyed everything that was there. To blow up the sangeet mahal, they brought entire Gold market wood in front and piled up the wood in the center of the mahal and lighted it up. The extreme heat generated was the only way the stone structure could be broken. And now only few pillars remain, the main structure gone, all blown up.

Similarly all the other structures of Hampi were destroyed, palaces, 18 – 20 foot tall well carved stautes (Ganesha, Narsimha, Vithalla), all in name of religion as this was deemed against the requirement of muslim religion. About 67 temples were looted and destroyed. Total of 600,000 people were massacred during this period. Only about 30% of original Hampi remains now, but even this 30% shows how grand the city must have
Badami Caves
been before its destruction.

We saw a repetition of this recently when 2000 years old Banyam Buddha in Afganistan was blown up using canons by Taliban. So much hatred, so much destruction towards something which one feels is not as per his religious belief, what a loss of art and creativity. Certainly this is not what any religion really says.

After the destruction, Hampi lay forgotten for next 200 years till late 19th century when one of the British Geographer stumbled on the ruins. Seeing whatever was visible, he got so impressed that he got in touch with Royal Geographical Society , London and asked them to send their best photographer who came over all the way and photographed entire Hampi and sent the photos to London. Based on those photos, British governement declared it as a heritage site and so it is actually thanks to British that Hampi was revived again. The exploration still continues as much of Hampi apparently still is buried in sand. Apparently come monsoon, the villagers go treasure hunting as water flow invariably brings up some or other treasures buried.

Day 5

Afternoon left for Pattadakal, 110 odd kms away. Actually
Badami Cave no. 3
it’s a triangle , three tourist places within 20 odd kms of each other (Pattadakal, Badami and Aihole), Each of these have stone temple structures prior to Hampi days.

Badami was first when independent structures were yet to come and temples were carved out in mountains (5th Century AD). So it has 4 caves, one for Jain , one for shiva , one for Vishnu and one normal. The third cave is the main and biggest one and the carvings are absolutely brilliant, huge statues carved in the mountain side.

Pattadakal was next in line of construction when individual standing temples started getting built. Unfortunatley again, the muslim invasion destroyed most of temples and the stautes inside but a huge bull made of granite still survives showing the carving capability of the carvers during those days who had the capability to carve the hardest known stone to mankind.



Stayed at Badami just opposite bus stand.

Tip : The Karnataka tourism hotel is way out of the place and not worth staying. It seemed like a ghost hotel where everything was locked up. Good food availability in Badami seems to be a big problem. Even
Cave carving , Badami
ordinary sada dosa seemed to be a big problem there from taste point of view.

Day 6

Left for Bijapur (80 kms away), on the way took a halt at Kudala Sangama where two rivers merge and there is a shiva temple middle of the merged river bed! Now they have made a huge round tower (about 5 odd storied high) around the temple. You cross a bridge over the river bed to reach this tower and then climb down inside the tower to reach the temple, as normally there would be river water all around outside it. Wonder in old days, how this temple was built and how they reached it.

Bijapur, the marvel of Islamic architecture, Gol Gumbaj is the main attraction and is the largest free standing dome in the world (tho now the claim for the same is being made by Vipassana pagoda built in 2008 at Gorai , Mumbai) , built in 17th century, it is HUGE and one really has to appreciate the architect who designed it.. Must be more than 15 storied high.

It has got graves of the ruler with his wives and kids and very interestingly his
Durga Temple, Aihole
hindu court dancer aptly named “Rambha”. The dynasty destroyed Hampi and its temples as it was deemed unislamic, then how did the king enjoy hindu classical dance (music and dance are unislamic as per some interpretations) and also so loved the court dancer that she was buried with him? Also the muslim religion forbids building of huge remembrance structures over dead, but we see this rule being totally forgotten by most of our muslim rulers. (both Gol Gumbaj and Ibrahim Rosa at Bijapur are actually mausoleums)

Anyways, gol gumbaj speaks of how advanced the muslim technology was when it came to architecture. You climb up the top through a narrow staircase and reach whispering gallery. Here if you whisper in a wall at one end, the person exactly diagonally opposite with his ear to the wall, will clearly hear it though the distance in between is as big as a football field and is totally empty. Unfortunately the crowd instead of whispering , shouts and howls, thinking the echo is the wonder, not realizing that true wonder is the whisper. It was one of the guards who showed us actually how it works ( a small payment to him
Kudal Sangam Temple
Climbing down the river bed to reach the temple
for the service worked for us).

Bijapur also has Ibhraim Roja, the memorial built for yet another ruler and has his and his family graves, good Islamic carvings and a palace of arches.

There is also a 55 ton canon called Malik a Maidan (ruler of battlefield) on one of the hillocks. It was the largest and heaviest built at that time to defent bijapur and was actually given as part of dowry when the queen got married. British tried to take it to London (just like everything else they could of india’s golden history). Luckily it was so heavy that the crane which was specially brought to lift it up from its place broke and thus the operation had to be abandoned. And thus the canon now lies little bit below from its original place where it fell after the crane broke.

The canon’s roar was supposed to be so loud that there was a specially built underground pit next to it. It was filled with water and the canon firing staff had 12 seconds after lighting the ignition to jump in this pit and stay inside the water. This was to protect their eardrums from
Gol Gumbaj, Bijapur
splitting.

Unfortunately or fortunately the canon was never used in an actual war and rather than Malik a Maidan, it remained Malik e Akhbar (ruler on paper!)

From Bijapur, we went straight to Solapur (80 kms) to catch our night train to Mumbai. The highway is totally congested with truck traffic and takes good enough more than 3 hours against our expectation of 2 hours. So keep enough margin if you are traveling this stretch.

From Solapur , one gets Siddheswar Express starting at 10.45 pm and reaching Mumbai next day morning at 6.30 am

Last but not the least, if you are traveling North Karnataka during the Ugadi (New year, Gudi Padwa in Maharashtra) days (which was March 23 this year), better avoid the internal roads. This day and the next day (for 2 days) is actually celebrated as Rang (colour) panchami there and its exactly like Holi played in rest of country. Every few kilometers your vehicles will be stopped by rowdy gangs of boys carrying oil colour cans and unless you pay up (anything between Rs 10 to Rs 50 depending on crowd size and your bargaining capacity) you and your vehicle will
Ibrahim Roja, Bijapur
be painted by these oil paints which are very difficult to get rid of . And at some places, inspite of us paying , they still put colour on our poor driver and threw the colour on vehicle front glass and side body.

That brought end to our short tour of North Karnataka, a hectic but refreshing tour covering both natural as well as man-made wonders.

April 15th 2012

Well now Gokarna. It was an interesting place to get to and I met some great people! The overnight 'delux' sleeper bus was supposed to be a special treat really for the journey from hampi to Gokarna. Getting to Hampi on the hard plastic chair of the standard public bus for 10hrs had not been comfortable in any way so i thought it was an investment to get a nights sleep on the trip back to the coast...

What I had not counted on was the 'delux' bus being full of cockroaches! And the part where they dumped all the people not headed to Goa (to Gokarna) in the middle of nowhere by the road at 2am to wait for an uncomfortable minibus to come collect us. Of course of the said minibus, the driver was fast asleep at that hour and failed to turn up... After 2 hours of waiting and making a fuss with a local hotel owner who seemed to know the driver, the hotel owner drove to the minibus driver's house to wake him up. So we were on the road again. With a whole lot of new mozzy bites.

We got to Gokarna and then had the task of making it to the final destination: Om beach. Although it went against every mental calculation I made we actually managed to fit 6 women (and all their rucksacks and daysacks) onto 1 auto-rickshaw for the journey. Sure we were sitting on top of eachother and the girl sitting with the driver had to get out and push it to make it start going but eventually te tuk tuk moved! And it made it all the way (at about 5 miles an hour!). We got there about an hour before sunrise and we sat on Om beach watching it go up before finding a place to stay. Had an early morning swim too, was brilliant.

Then spent two whole days on Om beach, which is pretty deserted, just enjoying the company of the girls we met on the bus, playing cards, drinking beer and all-round chilling out. Was great.

On the second day we did have a bit of a scare. Swimming in the sea, me and a Brazilian woman I met, Carolina, were discussing our childhood fear of sharks after watching Jaws (ok for me this fear is still quite real!). We were the only people in the water and suddenly we notice we are being frantically waved back to shore by this policeman. PANIC set in- we both grabbed eachother expecting to see a shark fin circling us! Actually the truth was worse, when we (suprisingly shortly!) got to shore he told us we should get out of the water because there might be a tsunami! Apparently there had been some bad earthquakes in Indonesia and the whole coast was preparing for a possible tsunami. Crazy. We slept so so well after that...!

Modified tools for the drive
Cheri's driving ""gloves"" (thank you united 1st class for those free socks)
We set out for Hampi from Bangalore on Day 3, but had to split the journey into 2 days due to significant traffic in Bangalore (yes, much worse than in Bombay and Delhi) and some rickshaw trouble that we wanted to resolve before moving ahead.

Our hotel was in the ""outskirts"" of Bangalore, but we still took about 2 hours to get away from the city traffic. Once outside, we ran into some car issues that took away the rest of the day. Thankfully, we got a rickshaw mechanic that fixed up our ride to as good as new, and we covered the distance to Hampi on Day 4.

It was interesting to see the changing landscape through the drive, starting with closer to tropical in Bangalore, dry desert-like landscape as we passed through the heart of Karnataka, to the boulders in Hampi. We plan to drive around Hampi tomorrow to see some of the ruins, and then head to Hyderabad.

Well happy easter readers! Hope you all had a good time :-) here there was not a chocolate egg in sight, far too hot. Besides the indians in Hampi were celebrating an entirely different festival; one which involved thousands of people milling about, throwing bananas and coconut milk around, supposedly in the direction of one of the temples.

The last couple of days I have been wondering between the ruins of this once-great Hindu city, and taking in the wonders that this festival involved, sweets and coloured pigments everywhere, decorated cows and floating platforms on the water. Besides that I have been taking in the fantastic landscape that encases the ruined city; huge boldor-filled vistas over a beautiful river. It reminds me of the pictures of some of the places in America, maybe arizona or something. Very interesting landscape. Extremely hot though! First thing in the morn and late afternoon are the only times ok for being out walking in it. Got up at 5 this morning and did a hike out and up this (quite small) mountain to a temple at the top, and watched the sunrise from there. Beautiful. Really incredible.

The bad news is...think I have lost irrevicably a load of my photos!! Tried to get them all up on facebook the other week but didnt have time to upload them all. The ones that were NOT uploaded, as well as those that were, are now missing from the camera and so I presume they are lost somewhere on the computer I was using at the time. I'm not fussed about some of the photos but I will miss my Taj Mahal ones!! I might be able to get them back...If I manage to meet up with Natalie in Kerela! Oh well. will have to see how we go. Have met a British girl, Louisa, here in Hampi and we are moving on back towards the coast, to Karnataka together probably tomorrow night, probs re-update the blog there!

Road to Bangalore
Trucks loved to get really close
Today was our first full day on the road. We started at 7am and headed off to Bangalore. The morning part of the drive was filled with beautiful scenery surrounding a relatively flat road. While the afternoon drive retained the beautiful scenery, it also contained singificant mountain passes which while not be signifcant for a 4-wheeler, were stressfull for our veg-mobile and its drivers. There were times during the drive where we were not sure if our Rickshaw would be able to get over the passes, let alone reach Bangalore by end of day. However, we (and the rickshaw) prevailed and got into Bangalore early enough to visit a mechanic and pamper our wheels with a tune up for a job well done!

Deviramman Temple
'Dada,i'm on my way to the bus stand'

I woke up with this call from Gaurav,my cousin. On the Previous day, I checked in to a small Hotel in Bangalore and when called up Gaurav and asked him to accompany me for my dream tour to Malnad region, like an offer to play for Mancehester United, he said,'see you tomorrow at the bus stand'.

It was a busy monday morning, around 7am,me and Gaurav walked in to the 'Majestic' bus stand in Bangalore. Our first destination was Hassan, a district town,around 200kms away from Bangalore. Buses from Bangalore to Hassan ply in every 10-15 minutes and depending upon the comfort level and your pocket size, one can opt any. We took a KSRTC 'Volvo' which was about to start for Mangalore. When asked whether this bus would go to Hassan, The driver, with a big smile, said,'hop in'. I was pretty happy that not only Gaurav had joined me but we got a dream start as expected. Distance between Bangalore to Hassan is about 198kms. The condition of the road was just amazing except in a few places where patch work was going on. The KSRTC 'Airavat' hit the
View of Bababudangiri Hills from Deviramman Temple
road with all the gears pulled and we were enjoying every bit of the journey. Slowly we crossed the Bangalore city limit, and the bus took to switch from the busy city streets to National Highway no. 75. To cover 198 kms, 'Airavat' took 4 hours and around 11:30 am we reached Hassan. Hassan is a district town with all the mondern facilities available. The newly constructed 'City Bus Stand' was really a gem on the crown. I was really envying the tidyness of this 'City Bus stand' and was trying to compare the same with the 'bus stands' in any distrcit town in Bengal. Even Gaurav was so happy, he took a couple of snaps for his 'Facebook' album. Since we had breakfast on the way, we decided to continue till Chickmagalur which would be some 50kms from Hassan. We switched buses and hoped in to a standard KSRTC bus which was absolutely waiting just for us.

'Dada, look at this bus, so well maintained, not like our CSTC buses', Gaurav broke his silence after a long spell.

'Yes, the main reason are the passengers who travel', I replied.

'Wish we could have such good buses
Somewhere on the way
in our West Bengal',Gaurav said.

I did notice a small line of frustration on his face. Gaurav went on describing each and every minute details about this bus. I knew that he was a 'freak' about automobiles and he 'marked' his mark with dignity. Hassan to Chickmagalur was around 50kms and this bus took almost an hour and half to cover the distance. In between, the bus stopped in Belur which is also famous for it's heritage. I told Gaurav that we would be covering Belur on a seperate tour, not at this time. I noticed he didn't object my decision. One best thing about Gaurav is,it doesn't matter what I do, he supports and thinks it is the best.Around 1:30pm we reached Chikmagalur.Even in the first week of April,we found that Chickmagalur got a 'cozy' climate which was enjoyable indeed. We walked out from the small 'City bus stand' and went on searching for a hotel. After browsing a few, we found 'Hotel Soundarya Residency' fit within our budget and seemed a decent family hotel. After completing the check in formalities and the moment we entered 'room 205' the first reaction came from Gaurav,'Awwwwwhhhh'. It took a couple
Close up view of Bababudangiri Hills
of seconds for me to find out whether it was a frustration or a 'jump for joy'. Indeed, he saw it, a breathtaking view of the Malnad hills was visible from the room itself. It did pull up the 'adrenaline' rush and I was thinking what was holding for us for tomorrow's trip when we would climb up that hill. We decided to spend the evening hovering
around Chikmagalur and made a trip to Bhadra Wildlife Sanctuary(which would be published as a seperate blog). I spoke with Mr.Yogi the car owner and cleared my intention about what we could expect the best out of the Malnad region. Finally we settled with Rs.1700/- for a day's tour which would cover almost all the possible places to explore.Mr.Yogi understood clearly that we were not there like 'any other tourists'.

Next day early at 6am one Indica honked in front of our hotel and we were ready to hit the road. When asked the name, the driver replied,'Ravi'. He seemed to be a middle aged family guy,later we thanked him numerously for driving us to one of the most beautiful but still less explored waterfalls which was not planned earlier.

The
Malnad wakes up
first place we stopped was a tea shop on the Chickmagalur-Kemmangudi road. After a long time I rediscovered the taste of 'Masala Buns' which was special in the coastal Karnataka region. After driving for another 30 minutes or so we stopped at 'The Deviramma Temple'. The place so serene as if the clock forgot to move ahead with time. Gaurav was enjoying so far as his silence said so. The temple was closed as it was around 7am. I was clicking around and was in love with this place literally. But we had a long road to hit, so unwillingly we both jumped in to the car and Mr.Ravi pulled the gear. This Chickmagalur-
Kemmangudi road was mainly laid out for the coffee estates which surrond the entire Malnad region. It was said that the first coffee plantation in India was started in this region first and later in The Nilgiris. Facts apart, we were enjoying the aroma of early morning brezze and Mr.Ravi was getting excited too.Mr.Sun was up meanwhile and we had to stop in between to greet him warmly.

Next stop was at Kalathi falls.I was pretty excited as I saw the photos earlier and was
Kemmangudi 'Z' point
planning to frame my creativity too.This falls is unique of it's type. There's a small temple at the base of this falls and the stream of water flows through temple.if you would like to make a visit to the temple, you perhaps need to walk through knee deep water. We reached Kalathi falls after 30-35 minutes drive but,'oh ! my god' was my first interaction. I did expect the stream of water would be less as it was an early summer,but I was more surprised rather frustrated to see a bunch of people taking bath,washing clothes,creating all sort of mess possible. I didn't take chance to click a single snap as it could have been a waste of time. Even Gaurav was frustrated too. I decided to go back to the car and continue for our next destination.

Next destination was The Hebbe falls. I was pretty anxious and frustrated after the Kalathi falls experience,but decided to make a visit to Hebbe still. Mr.Ravi told us previously that we needed to hire a Jeep from Kemmangudi to drive further 15kms to reach Hebbe. And accordingly, we settled for a jeep
or Rs 800/- and hoped in. Initially we thought
Wild Stream on the way to Hebbe Falls
the money was too high for a 15km drive, but later we had to change our views. The jeep left the tar road started climbing through the hills. The road was horrible,'No road' could have been a better word to say. Somehow we managed to grab a 'grip'. The driver,Chandu was trying his best to give us maximum confort but he couldn't do any better. We were riding on a road where 'dust and boulders' were laid out.Somehow after driving for an hour we reached a small place.Chandu suggested that we had to walk about a mile from here to reach The Hebbe falls. he also warned us to cross three wild streams through. Gaurav was fiercely excited as it seemed an adventurous walk indeed. We started walking and then we got the first stream to cross. The feeling was amazing, the water was freezingly cold.The track seemed utterly confusing but as suggested by Chandu, we maintained to walk down the stream. After crossing two more we got the first glimpse of 'The Mighty Hebbe Falls'.

'Dada, thank you, if I wouldn't have joined you,I could have missed one of the best sights of my life',that was Gaurav's expression.
Dhapa Dhapa Falls


I saw a few pics of Hebbe earlier but trust me none of them could do justice to this place. It was mesmerizing. Within a few seconds I started missing my sweetheart. I really don't have words to describe the beauty of this place.May Kalathi Falls have led us to frustration but this place have compensated more
with it's stature. It was depp inside thik lush green forests,amongst which from a roaring height mighty Hebbe Falls gorging down to a 200 mts stairs. I had an intention to take bath as there was aboslutely no one except us, but due to time constraints I had to give up the 'will' and started clicking around. Gaurav
was trying his best to take the best shots with his 'Nokia N8' cell phone. After spending an hour at the base of Hebbe, we strolled back thorugh the same way and following which took a ride through the 'boulder roads' back to Kemmangudi. My jeans was all dirty and I had to continue with the same pair for the rest of the day. But Hebbe took us to such a height that we forgot everything and were trying 'record' as many shots as
Hebbe Falls
we could. We kept playing our 'Hebbe pics' and promised Chandu and 'Hebbe' both that we would come back during upcoming monsoon.Somehow we two speechless souls sank deep into the thoughts of Hebbe. It was around 2pm, we had to stop for lunch,not for us buy atleast for Mr.Ravi. As we had your 'soul' filled with the beauty of Hebbe that we could have continued for the rest of the day. We stopped in a place at Attigundi for lunch and managed with steaming 'Chapathis and Chicken Masala'. Next destination was 'Dutta Peeth' at Bababudangiri Hill. But the beauty of Hebbe took us to 'sweeping feet' that we reamined much of 'silent pranks'.

The road from Kemmangudi to Bababudan giri as mixed bag of 'Bounty and Bumpy'. Around 3:00pm we
reached Bababudangiri and drove further to Manikyadhara view point. There was a narrow stream but due to insufficiency of water,it turned out to be a blunt one for us. But yes, the breathtaking view of the Chikmagalur Valley from Manikyadhara view point was 'woth' a visit to this place. We took a few clicks and then proceeded to our next destination.

After crossing a few wild streams and
Malnad Hills
somewhere in between the serenity, Mr.Ravi stopped the vehicle and gave us a big smile. We didn't understand the lines between.

'Anything happened?',I asked with curiosity.

'Any technical issues',Gaurav joined me as well.

'Sir, pack your cameras, trek down a mile and come back, it's a surprise gift from me',Ravi replied to all our questions with his smile.

I got his intention clear as I am always trustworhy to this local folks about something out of the box.

'Let's see',I asked Gaurav to get down and join me.

'Sir, this is a private place so make sure you go and come as early as possible',Mr.Ravi turned his FM on after stating this.

I was forming the 'cloud of questions' for me, what this place could hold for us.

'Dada, It seems some waterfalls',Gaurav broke the silence.

I was hearing a noise of a wild stream and was trying to judge the source of that noise.Hesitantly we started following that noise and after climbing further down about a mile the surprise was unfold. Mother nature carved this place with utmost secrecy and excellence. You guessed it right,It was a waterfall and
just
Rocky Malnad Hills
stunning. We have seen Hebbe earlier today but this place was no less than Hebbe. Stream of 'white satin' flowing down on a canvas of carving 'dark granite'. I was stunned and so was Gaurav. Again wherever we go serenity follows us. We were just the two 'souls' to enjoy the beauty of this 'mother
Nature's' marvel. When everything goes right something turns 'the table'. My Canon 60D blinked an unhappy warning of 'low battery'. Still we had the Mullayangiri left in our list. Left with no option,I switched my camera off and sat at one corner trying to feel the rhythm of nature. Gaurav was trying to
venture the neraby surroundings with a 'frame' to reach the 'higher ground'. Don't know what happened,I woke up from my dream as the time was clicking away.

After saying 'adieu' to this 'un named falls', we climbed back the same stroll and reached where mr.Ravi was waiting with his car.

Next stop was at Mullayangiri hills, we had plans to experience one of the most scenic sunset amongst the Malnad Hills. We reached Mullayangiri hills and climbed around 300 steps. Mullayangiri is the highest peak between The Himalayas and The
View from Manikyadhara view point
Nilgiris. There we met with Anand and Mansi,a wonderful couple who
drove all the way from Pune to this place to enjoy the beauty of Malnad hills. The sunset was worth a watch. Finally we climbed down the same stairs and drove back to Chikmagalur.

Another day was over from 'a few days' left in life.Indeed,We had the best of the Malnad hills.I am thanking Gaurav not only for joining me but being my 'cady' in this tour.

A snapshot of Chikmagalur :

How to get there :

By train : Nearest rail stations are Hassan and Kadur, from which Chickmagalur is 50 and 40kms respectively.A taxi would cost Rs. 1000-1200 from either of these places.

By road : Distance from Chickmagalur to Bangalore via Hassan-Tumkur is 245 kms. From Mysore 178 kms. The road condition is just amazing.



By Air : Bangalore - 245 kms and Mangalore - 151 km.

Where to stay; Chikmagalur has staying options aplenty. Starting from star category hotels to the budget family ones. We stayed at Hotel Soundarya Resinency.

Room rates are 900/- AC Double, 500/- Deluxe Double Non A/C.

Being a district
Sunset from Mullayangiri
town Chikmagalur has all the bank ATMs,Hospitals,Supermarkets. So you never run out of options.

Notes:

Chikmagalur to Kemmangudi can be reached via two routes

1) Chikmagalur-Deviramma Temple-Kalathi Falls-Kemmangudi

2) Chikmagalur-Bababudangiri-Attigundi-Bhadra WLS-Kemmangudi

Best would be to follow route 1 to reach Kemmangudi and then follow route 2 while returning. Infact that's what we did.

Hope this blog finds you in a happy note and if you have questions any, please let me know.

Asia » India » Karnataka » Ramanagaram
March 25th 2012
Published: March 25th 2012


Ramdevar beta is popularly known as Ramgad as pictorised in the famous Bollywood film Sholay. The place is a paradise for trekking, rock climbing and photo shooting. There are two temples on the top of the hill, viz, Rama temple and Rameshwar temple.
How to reach


Ramanagara, is about 50 kms from Bangalore, on Bangalore-Mysore highway. While coming from Mysore, it is about 90 kms from Mysore. While coming from Mysore, you have to cross Srirangapatna, Mandya and Channapatna to reach Ramanagara. Ramangara is famous for silk market and is know as the silk town.

One may go upto Ramanagar town by bus and then take an auto to Ramadevar beta. There is no facility to stay there overnight. So one has to plan the return trip on the same day.


Other places nearby



Sri Revana Siddeshwara Betta is also located in Ramanagara District about 70 Kms Away From Bangalore City. While visiting Ramadevar beta, one may plan to visit Revena Siddeshwar beta on the same day.

There is another place called Kengal hanumantharaaya temple which is also near to ramanagara City. Besides Janapadaloka and Kanwa resorvoir are nearby places which may be combined on a single trip.

There are about seven hills in 10Km radius of Ramanagara, viz, Yatirajagiri, Sidilakallu Betta Shivaramagiri, Krishnagiri, Somagiri, Revanna Siddeshwara Betta and Jala Siddeshwara Betta, Randevara Betta. All these sites offer abundant opportunities for trekking, camping and exploring the wilderness of nature.
What is there on Ramadevar Beta



There are quite a few granite hills around Ramanagaram, which are great attractions for adventure enthusiasts. Ramadevar beta is the same place known as Ramagad in the famous Bollywood film Sholay. The famous Gabbar Sing was sitting on this hill with Samba and Kaalia.



While entering in to the area, you will find a nice Arch welcoming you to the hills. There are plenty of places to climb and explore on both the sides of the road. Before reaching Ramadevar beta, you will see a Lotus Pond on the left. The pond is full of beautiful lotus. You may find children selling lotus there.



After seeing lotus pond and trekking nearby hill you may like to proceed further towards Ramadevar hill. The vehicle can go up to this place, the foot of ramadevar hill. You have to park your vehicle here and take the stairs to climb to the top of the hill.



From this entrance to the hill, you have to start climbing. You have to climb a total of around 300 steps. The route is in the middle of the forest and is quite exciting. While climbing the hill after 250 steps you will come across a Hanuman temple on the way.



Climbing is very exciting as because the stairs are very neat and clean amongst the dense forests and hills all around. This trekking is less risky and can be taken up by women, children provided you have enough strength to go up.



After climbing for about half an hour to one hour you will find Ramadevara temple on the top of the hill. The hill is famous because of this temple. The temple is more than 1000 years old as people say. Some people believe that Lord Rama had visited this place. From near the temple you can have a good view of the hills and places around.



Near Ramadevara beta, there is a natural pond on the hilltop, called Rama Tirtha. It is interesting to see water at such a height. However, the place is fenced and people are not allowed to go down to water for safety.

There is another temple called Rameshwar Temple about 30 meters away from Ramadevar Temple. You have to climb up a little to reach that temple. The pond Rama Tirtha is in between these two temples.



Near the temples on the top, there is a small tower. You can have a nice view of the hills from this place. The hills are 60 to 100 feet in height and very steep. Many professional rock climbers climb on these cliffs with equipments and proper safety measures. Many adventure groups come here for face climbing, boulder climbing, chimney climbing, hill climbing, rock climbing etc.



Ramadevara beta has something for everyone of every age group. All the shooting points of Sholay are still there. You can see beautiful rocks and nature around. The religious people can visit the temples. Besides this is an awesome place for shooting pictures.
Some more information



You should have sufficient time to move around the hills. The real pleasure is to climb and see. If you are lack of time, you cannot enjoy much.

Ramadevar beta and Siddheswhar beta are different, about 20 kms apart from each other. Some bloggers confuse between them and mix up the photos of Ramadevar beta with Siddheshwar beta.

Some bloggers mention Ramadevar beta as Randevar beta, both are same.

There are two temples on Ramadevar beta, one Rama temple and other Rameshwar temple. Besides there is a hanuman temple on the way while climbing.

How to reach


From Bangalore City, drive towards south till you reach Kanakapura road (you may take busy shortcut routes or long ring roads depending upon your location in Bangalore.). Now move on Kanakpura Road – the National Highway 209 – towards Kanakpura. After a few kms you will cross NICE ring road. Then after about 18 kms you will find a sign board to take a left turn for Buddha Pyramid.



Note: if you miss the road to pyramid valley then you will reach Horahalli, about 4 kms ahead. In that case you have to return back again.

From Kanakpura road diversion the road is rather easy. You just have to continue for about 2 kms on Kebbedoddi Village / Pyraimid Valley road. The road is good and motorable.
About the Pyramid Valley


Maitreya-Buddha Pyramid is world’s largest meditational pyramid. The size of the pyramid is 160ft. x 160ft. Height 102 ft (equivalent to 10 floor building). The pyramid was built in 2006. The capacity of the pyramid is to accommodate 5000 people for meditation.



There is accommodation available for halting in nights, ranging from dormitories to VIP suites. The valley is spread over 26 acres of land.

The energy in this Mega-Pyramid is amplified by over 640 natural Himalayan crystals fitted inside the hall. (Source: Pyramid Valley Brochure).

This Pyramid Valley has been selected as one of the 7 wonders of Bangalore , survey conducted by Bangalore Mirror (published by the Times of India group).





The Maitreya Pyramid is open 18 hours a day from morning till night. Buddha Poornima is the most auspicious day celebrated here. There is large gathering on the day with Aakhanda Dhyana (continuous meditation).
Some impressive facts


We were impressed to see the free services provided by the pyramid management. While in many other places you have to pay for everything, pyramid valley provides many facilities for free.

They give brochures and leaflets when you enter the valley as a token of greetings.

There is no vehicle parking fee in side the pyramid campus.

There is no money collection near the shoe stand.

There is no money collection for using toilets.

Free food is provided twice a day, at 1 PM and 8 PM, through annadana program.

Free meditation classes on Sundays and many more weekly and monthly spiritual development programs.
What to see in pyramid valley


The Maitreya Buddha pyramid is the main attraction of pyramid valley.

Apart from that there is meditation teaching place, an ampitheatre, a research center, a holistic health center, tree of life, bookstore, tapasthal, lake, gardens and statues.


Meditation inside pyramid


It is believed that Meditations done inside a Pyramid is three times more powerful. Many people experience great relaxations after meditating in pyramid. All are welcome (rather encouraged) to do meditation inside the pyramid. We also did meditation for half an hour inside the pyramid.

At the center of the pyramid there is an erected spot called King Chamber. This is about 34 ft tall and can accommodate about 30 people to sit and meditate. But it is said that the meditation done on this pedestal structure is even more powerful. However, this place is slightly hotter than the floor level because of its height. After meditating on kings chamber for some time we preferred to meditate on the floor which was much more spacious.

The entrance halls at the base of the pyramid has many statues of Buddha and scripts of Buddha’s teaching. There are portraits of Brahmarshi Partriji who founded the pyramid valley. Photography is not allowed in this area and inside pyramid. Children below 6 years are not allowed inside the pyramid as they might create noise inside.

There are many more activities inside pyramid related to meditation and spiritual development. Some programs are weekly and some monthly. For details please refer to their site www.pyramidvalleyorg.

You are not allowed to carry your food to do picnic in Pyramid valley. However, you get free food twice a day there.



Besides there is a cafeteria where you can buy foods of your choice. We took some idli, bada, fried rice etc. inside the cafetaria. It was good.



The cafeteria is open since 6.30 in the morning till 7.30 in the evening.
Overall Experience


The overall experience of Pyramid valley was excellent. The area is quite large and is enough to keep you busy walking and exploring various small items.

How to go there:
You can follow any route to catch Bangalore Kanakapura main road – which is the National Highway 209. Go straight on the highway towards Kanakapura. After a few Kms you will cross NICE ring road. Go further on the highway. You will find “Art of Living” head quarter after 15 kms. Go further about 3 Kms, you will find a place called Kagalpura. Take a left turn from Kagalpura.
After taking the turn, go straight for about 1.5 kms till you find a hospital (?) / rehabilitation center where you have to take a left turn again. Better ask the locals otherwise you are very likely to miss this road as there is no proper landmark to explain. However, if you miss this road and go straight you will still reach the other side of TK falls through CRPF camp. But this road is longer and extremely rough for driving.



After turning left you have to drive 3 kms more to reach the fall, In some places you can see the river on the right side of the road. I had a fear that the road could be bad as many bloggers mention their experience. But luckily the road condition was good till we reached the fall.

What to see:

There is a temple called “Muneswar Temple” at the entrance to the fall. A small temple under a big tree. The place is peaceful.



Then you have to trek further in to the forest and rocks. Trekking is interesting but tiring too. One should better carry some food and drinking water for emergency. While going down to the water we came across a beautiful spot. A stone painted as forest god and some traditional art – jhoti- near it.



The rocks inside water look very attractive. They are interesting to climb. However, many of them are steep, smooth and slippery. One has to be very careful while climbing.



It was extremely hot and climbing too much was very tiring. We finished three bottles of water that we carried. Although there was no water in the fall, the place was still enjoyable. It can be said to be a good picnic spot.



We spent about 2 hours in the place and then proceeded for Pyramid Valley, which is on the same Kanakapura road about 15 kms from TK falls.

Agara is in the south east side of Bangalore city. There is a rarely visited lake in Agara known as Agara lake. Agara area has been very well developed during recent years. There are quite a few temples in Agara, two of them are notable, one, the Jagannath Temple and the other Hanuman temple. Both of them are build during recent years. The temple is actually small but the statue is extremely large. The 102 feet Gigantic statue of Lord hanuman is standing on a lotus pedestal.

The statue is on the road side and visible from quite a distance. Although the temple opens in the morning and evening, there is no timing for seeing the statue as it is always visible from any side. The statue is east facing, so if you go in the morning the face of the statue will be lighted. In the afternoon the backside of the statue will be lighted.



The temple is popular among the local residents from Agara, Madivala and HSR layout area, and is visited by hundreds of visitors every day. But many more just have darshan from the road pay their homage while passing by the road. There are also idols of Naga Devata under the peepal tree.

There is one beautiful temple in front of the Hanuman statue – known as “Sita Rama Bhakta Hanumanta Temple” (picture below).

There is also another temple - Anjaneya Temple - behind the statue (picture below). The backside of the Gigantic Hanuman statue is visible from this place.



Don't forget to visit the Jagannath temple when you are going towards that side. The Jagannath temple is located next to the Hanuman temple, on the other side of the road, prominently visible from each other. The Jagannath temple is built recently and is quite popular in that area.

Mysore
Le palais en tenue de nuit
20 mars 2012, Mysore et Ooty

Après un train de nuit de 12heures qui s’est, comme toujours, bien déroulé, nous sommes arrivés à Mysore, une ville de taille moyenne au centre du Karnataka. Bien qu’on ait choisit cette ville prime à bord pour transiter vers les montagnes, nous y sommes restés 4 jours. Nous avons visité un magnifique palais différent de ce que nous avions vu jusqu’ici, celui-ci mêlant une architecture européenne de style baroque au style indien. J’étais bien désolée que les photographies à l’intérieur soient interdites, mais on a pu se reprendre sur l’extérieur qui s’illumine les soirs de fin de semaine, des ampoules parcourant tous les contours du palais et de ses arches d’entrée. Magnifique!

Mysore a aussi un marché central qui vaut le détour pour ses étales colorés de fruits, légumes, fleurs, soieries et menus objets en bois de santal (spécialité de la région). C’était jusqu’ici notre plus belle expérience dans un marché en Inde et on en a profité pour voir comment sont fabriqués les bâtons d’encens, acheter des fruits et des fleurs, et, bien évidemment, prendre des photos! Une seule chose à ne pas faire… Nous soupçonnons les fleurs que j’ai laissé dans
Mysore
la chambre être à l’origine d’une infestation de mini-mouches. N’évoquant pas cette raison, nous avons demandé d’être changé de chambre à 11h pm parce que la centaine de mouches qui volait au-dessus de notre lit pouvait même traverser notre filet!

Les autres journées, on a monté 1000 marches (plus pour s’entraîner que pour atteindre un sommet où se trouvent un temple), on est allé se promener dans la ville puis au zoo (qui parfois peut nous sembler plus civilisé) et on a visité le Rail Museum (qui ressemblait plus à un parc pour enfants qu’autre chose). En fait, c’est mon chum ingénieur qui a rendu la visite intéressante en m’expliquant le fonctionnement des vieilles locomotives à vapeur! Et le reste du temps je l’ai passé au lit, prise de manifestations intestinales incontrôlables et de douleurs musculaires qui semblaient être sur chaque parcelle de mon corps. Même mon cuir chevelu était douloureux!

La dernière journée, à la centrale d’autobus, j’ai engloutit le jus d’une noix de coco pour me réhydrater, suite au conseil d’une indienne qui m’a vu passer au pas de course 2 fois de suite en 15 minutes, armée de mon rouleau de papier de toilettes. Paraîtrait-il
Mysore-marche
que ce jus légèrement salé est naturellement bourré d’électrolytes. Hey ben, qui l’aurait cru ! Non seulement je vais me coucher moins niaiseuse, mais mieux réhydratée. Yeah!

J’ai tout de même dû avoir recours aux grands moyens pour poursuivre notre route. C’est donc bien bouchée d’immodium que j’ai pu aisément profiter de mon 5 heures de bus climatisé dans les Nilgiris Hills. On a traversé des plantations de thé à flancs de montagnes, puis un parc national, où l’on a aperçu des éléphants sauvages! Ils étaient tout simplement magnifiques, d’un beau gris charcoal avec de longues défenses couleur, vous aurez deviné : ivoire! Et comme ce parc de 320km2 compte 600 têtes de leur espèce, il n’est pas surprenant de croiser des pancartes de traverses d’éléphants sur la route! Malheureusement, dû aux risques élevés de feux forêt en saison sèche, on ne peut pas y faire de trekking. Ce n’est pas grave; on a un plan B qui promet…. à suivre!

On est donc maintenant à Ooty, une petite ville en montagnes. Après Hampi et Mysore où la température atteignait 30° le jour, on se réjouit du 20° de Ooty et des soirées suffisamment fraîches pour porter une
Mysore
Les fleurs sont surtout vendus en guirlande et servent souvent d'offrandes dans els temples. Les femmes se les accrochent aussi dans les cheveux; non-merci pour moi!
petite laine!

Est-ce que je vous ai dit que depuis notre arrivée nous avons que des journées ensoleillées, sans nuage ni une seule goutte de pluie ?!

Sur ce, bonne journée!

L’indiennerie du jour : à un quai d’embarquement, plutôt que d’attendre son tour pour monter dans un autobus, un homme a monté et poussé son petit garçon dans une fenêtre pour se réserver une place!

Hi there,

It doesn't seem like five minutes ago I was writing about Nepal and now it's time to give you the latest on our trip round India! Since Lewys' has already written his blog and told some of the funnier anecdotes I'll do my best to make this interesting...



India, where do I start? Even as I'm writing I know how impossible it's going to be to describe our first two weeks in this amazing country. I had read about it, I had seen pictures and I'd spoken to people who have visited, but nothing can prepare you for actually being here.



Delhi hits you like a ton of bricks. We thought Kathmandu was crazy but nothing compared to the mayhem that is Delhi. The city is just huge and and there are more people that you could possibly imagine - think rush hour in London, only with a lot more people, more noise, more filth, more traffic and more cows. Now imagine that as you walk down the street, dodging piles of rubbish, speeding motorbikes and wandering cattle, you are also the centre of attention. Every person stares at you when you walk past, asks you if you need a tuk-tuk, a sari, a USB stick or a pair of sunglasses (even though you are wearing sunglasses). ""Hello my friend...come into my shop"" echoes down the street and rickshaws crawl along beside you just in case after saying no five times you miraculously change your mind.



Every day in India has been an 'experience'. Every day throws up new challenges to test your patience, your level of tolerance is constantly pushed to the limit and your ability to cope with new situations is challenged. The stark contrast between the very rich and the impossibly poor is in evidence everywhere and poverty rears its ugly head wherever you go. Unlike Nepal, where there isn't such a wealthy elite, in India there is a clear divide between the haves and have-nots, which is hard to reconcile.India has also been fascinating. The places we have seen have been unforgettable, steeped in the history and the past grandeur of empires. The mighty subcontinent is vast and so far we have only seen a small part of it.



Our first full day in Delhi, still slightly shell-shocked, we wandered down Chandi Chouk, the main bazaar in Old Delhi. This huge street, lined with sari shops and spice sellers, leads up the majestic Red Fort - once the seat of the Mughal Empire. The guide book describes the fort as a ""sandstone carcass of its former self"", but I thought the crumbling ruins gave a fitting glimpse into the decadence that once had its home here. We also saw the Jama Masjid Mosque, which offers a relatively peaceful oasis in the middle of the crazy and crowded old city.



After a day in the capital we started our whistlestop tour of Rajasthan - the desert state. The first stop was Agra (actually in Uttar Pradesh but near to Rajasthan). It turned out to be more difficult than we thought to get to (see Lewys' blog for full details of us turning up a month early for our train and a pigeon using my head as a toilet). Agra itself isn't much to look at but the main attraction, the Taj Mahal, doesn't disappoint. With its perfect goemetric shape and flawless white marble walls that shimmer in the dawn sunlight it looks unreal, almost etherial. It manages to balance perfect simplicity with the most elaborate detail and is far more beautiful than I had imagined. Another, more unexpected delight in Agra was the impressive fort, which sits along the banks of the Yamuna River. Apart from the small Indian man of about 40 who asked if Lewys was my husband and tried to take pictures of me, twice, it was a beautiful place to spend the afternoon.



En route from Agra to Jaipur we stopped for a night in Fatehpur Sikri, a small town with an historic fort (yep, another fort!). We got quite a bit of hassle here, mostly from young guys who claimed they weren't guides but 'students' wanting to give a free tour to practice their English - a likely story! The highlight was sitting in the magnificent mosque and watching the sun set.



Jaipur was not my favourite place. We were pestered a lot by tuk-tuk drivers and I was stared at constantly by Indian men because of my blonde hair and fair skin - I think we both found it pretty difficult to deal with sometimes. We visited the City Palace, which was ok but compared with the simple elegance of the Taj Mahal it seemed gaudy and over the top to me. Climbing the 'Heaven Piercing Minaret', however, gave us a spectacular view over the city. It was originally built so that the ladies of the court could watch the happenings of the city below, and it still offers an amazing vista of the pink city.



The next stop was Jodhpur, the pretty blue city which nestles below the imposing Mehrangarh Fort (that's 4 and counting). Jodhpur was much smaller and therefore more manageable than the other cities we had visited. The colourful bazaar that surrounds the clocktower and main square was a great place to wander around and haggle over silk scarves (Lewys was less interested in this, not sure why..). The fort itself was also my favourite out of the many we saw in Rajathan because it was really well-maintained and there was a free audio-tour, which was really interesting (yes, I'm that cool). We ended up spending a few days longer in Jodhpur than we'd planned because Lewys was ill, but it meant we could see the crazy Holi festival there. People have bonfires and throw colored powder and water over eachother - we got a soaking from some kids who threw a bucket of water over us from their balcony, then they pulled faces and ran away!



Our last city to see in Rajasthan was Jaisalmer, a fort town that was even smaller again and on the edge of the Thar Desert. There we did the obligatory 'Jeep"" (closer to Lewys' Citroen ZX than any jeep I've ever seen) and Camel safari. We were a little short on time so we only spent an afternoon riding the Camels among the nearest available sand-dunes, which was long enough I think (some people do it for nearly two weeks - I think saddle-sore would be an understatement!). It was a fun afternoon and it was really nice to get out of the city for the first time in 2 weeks. Our camel driver Nihal and his little son were great and made the experience really enjoyable. After a couple of hours riding around we stopped to watch the fiery sun set over the endless horizon - definitely worth it.



Our trip around Rajasthan ended with a lovely 19 hour sleeper train back to Delhi, which was surprisingly ok. Next we make our way to the South, which I think is a lot more relaxed than the north and so will have more of a holiday atmosphere (so I'm told!). Rajathan is an amazing part of India and I think we were definitely thrown in at the deep end starting there. Despite all the 'annoyances' we've had an incredible couple of weeks.



Well that's all for now, hope you enjoyed my ramblings!

Lots of Love xxx

Bonjour and welcome to the second instalment of my Asia travel blog...

We arrived in Delhi on the 25th of Feb after a pretty scenic flight from Kathmandu. Although a seasoned traveller of the subcontinent (I visited for a few weeks with Dad, Kylie and Andrew when I was 5 years old), this was to be nearly 3 weeks that I won't forget in a hurry.

Delhi is without a doubt the busiest, noisiest, dirtiest and most abrasive place I have ever been. Once the jewel in the crown of the opulent Mughal Empire, it's now almost impossible to picture the splendour and wealth that once existed here. We spent a couple of days looking around, visiting the Red Fort and the Jama Masjid before catching the train to Agra. This wasn't quite as straightforward as it sounds. After spending an hour and a half at the mayhem that is New Delhi Railway Station attempting to book a ticket, we gave up. 'Luckily', we managed to book a ticket through our hostel for the following morning. Rising at 7, we set off in a taxi to Nizamuddin Railway Station only to find that our train was departing in a month's time. Cheers. To put the icing on the cake a pigeon relieved itself on Kat's head as we stepped out of the station. Welcome to India.

There's no doubt that the Taj Mahal was worth all the trouble. The most beautiful building I have ever seen and so much bigger than you expect it to be. Amazing.

From Agra we caught the bus to Fatehpur Sikri, once the capital of India for fourteen years. There's an incredible mosque and fort there but the amount of hassle we got from 'tour guides', 'students' and 'ticket sellers' was just ridiculous (even by Indian standards) and did spoil the experience somewhat. I've discovered that speaking Welsh to people who are particularly persistent helps quite a lot...

Jaipur was the next stop (a 5 hour bus journey extended by a break down). Known as the Pink City, it has over 3 million inhabitants and is everything you expect a big Indian city to be - noisy, chaotic and unbelievably polluted. To be honest, the highlight here was the cable TV in the hostel - cricket on 24/7. Indians are genuinely obsessed with cricket and if you ask any Indian who their favourite player is, there is only one answer - Sachin.

The train journey to Jodhpur was not particularly straightforward (noticing a trend..?). This one was delayed by 5 hours so we spent a thrilling afternoon in a waiting room at Jaipur Railway Station. Jodhpur is far nicer than Jaipur and has an incredible fort (known as Mehrangarh) towering over the city. We spent a few days here looking around Mehrangarh, the Clock Tower bazaars and the winding back streets. I managed to find myself a fantastic waterproof, glow-in-the-dark watch and a silly hat to keep the sun off my head for a grand total of 1 pound and 40 pence. The watch is still working if you're wondering...

Sadly I was struck down by the inevitable travel sickness that comes with visiting India whilst in Jodhpur. The less said about that the better, but it did mean I missed the Hindu festival of Holi - where everybody throws colourful powder and water on each other and get very drunk. Pretty gutting.

The last stop on our whirlwind tour of Rajasthan was Jaisalmer (getting there involved an incredibly hot crowded 6 hour bus journey with no toilet or food stops. Painful.). It's almost impossible to visit Jaisalmer without going into the desert on a camel so, after barely having put our bags down, we'd booked an afternoon's excursion into the Great Thar Desert.

Setting off in our 'jeep' (actually something resembling a Vauxhall Corsa), we travelled about 40km before hopping on a camel and travelling a bit further through the desert until we found some sand dunes (a rarity in the Great Thar Desert). From here we watched the sunset, which was absolutely amazing. Incidentally, riding a camel is not so different from riding a horse, except you are a lot higher up and they have stupidly long necks.

Finally, we hopped on the 19 hour sleeper train back to Delhi (only three quarters of an hour late!). Sharing a bed with both my bags isn't the most comfortable but we have 3 more sleepers booked for South India so I better get used to it!

I don't think there's been an easy day in India yet. We've seen some incredible things and met some great people, but I never thought that just being in a place could be such a test of personality and patience. I find that I'm pretty much constantly see-sawing between loving and hating this country... Quite an experience. There's so much more I could have written but I think that's probably enough for now as I'm in a very sweaty internet cafe (in Bangalore). We head off to Hampi tonight before making our way down to the beaches of Kerala.

I hope all's well back home,

Lots of love,

Lewys

Holi Hampi 2
Nos munitions!
14 mars 2012, Hampi, Karnataka

Happy Holî !!

Encore endormis et endoloris de notre brève nuit en bus, on débarque en plein centre d’une allée de ruines bordée de palmiers, centrée sur un énorme temple digne de quel film cette fois-ci ? Je dirais… Indiana Jones! Après que mon Indi à moi nous ait sauvés des sauvages chauffeurs de rickshaw en les envoyant cavalièrement promener, nous nous sommes dirigés à pieds vers le mystérieux village de Hampi. La ville baignait déjà dans une atmosphère de fête à 8h30, les enfants courant dans les ruelles avec des bouteilles d’eau colorée et nous regardant d’un air espiègle…

En poursuivant nos recherches de Guesthouse, on nous a gentiment recommandé de rapidement se loger et de se nourrir avant 10h, avant que tout soit fermé, faute de devoir aller fêter! Wouhou!

Le Holî est une fête religieuse dédiée au dieu Kâma, qui souligne également l’arrivée du printemps, et qui tient lieu à la pleine lune de février-mars. La tradition veut que l’on asperge nos amis de couleurs aux différentes significations : le vert pour l’harmonie, l’orange pour l’optimisme, le bleu pour la vitalité et le rouge pour la joie et l’amour.
Holi Hampi 1
Pour ce faire, on porte nos plus laids vêtements, on achète des poignées de poudres colorées que l’on étend ou lance sur les autres, peu importe qui, en dansant aux rythmes des tambours. Évidemment que Phil et moi y avons participé! Avec chacun un petit indien grimpé sur nos épaules, on a suivi la foule jusqu’à ce que la fatigue prenne le dessus. Voir les photos et vidéo pour le résultat : un 2 heures de pure folie!! On a a-do-ré! Le seul hic, c’est que ça va prendre plus d’une douche pour faire partir le jaune dans mes cheveux, le mauve dans mon cou et le rouge sur le bord de mon nez… mais tout le village est dans cette situation!

Mais si nous sommes venus à Hampi, c’est prime à bord pour son patrimoine archéologique au cœur d’un paysage lunaire : des dizaines de temples en ruines bordés d’une frange de palmiers et de bananiers, le tout perdu dans une mer d’immenses rochers d’une couleur sable. Ces mastodontes arrondis par le temps sont empilés les uns sur les autres, et leur origine demeure un mystère pour les scientifiques, leur présence dans la région étant unique et isolée.
Holi Hampi 3
De faux Sadhu.. qui vous demandent des dons, evidemment..
Quand on approche les ruines des temples, on a l’impression d’arriver dans un oasis au milieu d’un désert, le soleil, la chaleur et le silence étant de la partie.

Nous soupçonnons que ces rochers ont été coupés et façonnés en colonnes et poutres pour les temples, comme le témoignent des séries d’encoches identiques sur les arrêtes des colonnes puis sur des rochers environnants. Il y a deux choses qui me fascinent de ces temples : la structure qui semble tenir que par l’emboîtement des pièces, et les figures sculptées en haut-relief dans la pierre, dont le motif peut etre surprenant! (Voir les photos)

On a passé la moitié de notre temps à visiter ces temples, et l’autre moitié à se perdre! On a entre autres marché sur une petite route de campagne assez longtemps pour littéralement changer de village plutôt que de trouver un des sites majeurs, allongeant notre marche d’un bon 6 kilomètres. Oups! (Oui Emman, mon sens de l’orientation légendaire n’a que celui de Phil comme égal!). Le jour suivant, on a traversé la rivière et on a marché dans un paysage semblable à celui du voisin d’en face, mais où les temples étaient remplacés par
Holi Hampi 4
des rizières. C’est jusqu’ici le plus beau paysage que j’ai vu en Inde!

Mis à part Holî-Hampi, on a eu l’occasion de pousser nos observations sur les vaches indiennes. Constat : leur quantité et leur taille est inversement proportionnel à la grosseur des villes, les vaches ‘’urbaine’’ n’appartiennent à personne et sont libres de se promener partout en ville, et elles ne se rassemblent en troupeau que le soir. D’ailleurs, chanceux comme on est, il y en a une vingtaine qui dorment sous notre fenêtre de chambre. L’autre soir, alors que Phil respirait l’air frais, il a vu un Japonais contourné le troupeau en grimpant sur un muret. Coup de théâtre : en sautant de son perchoir, le Japonais a atterri directement dans une grosse bouse de vache bien fraîche! Depuis cette nuit, nous avons toujours une lampe frontale avec nous pour voir où nous marchons lorsque la panne électrique quotidienne survient. Ou pour ne pas marcher sur les propriétaires du Guesthouse qui dorment à même le sol dans l’entrée, ce qui est une pratique courante en Inde pour les propriétaires et employés de commerces, restaurants et hôtels.

Sur ce, Happy Holî, d’autant plus que le printemps semble

Mahishasura
That's me in front. Demons are silly, not dangerous.
Mysore is a beautiful clean city—lots of gardens. It is the home of sandalwood perfume. Enjoy the pictures!

We learned a little about Hinduism. Three levels: Gods—but there are many and you get to choose the one you like, example, God of trees or rain, or whatever. Second come humans who can choose to be good or bad—issue of karma comes into this. Third group are demons. Demons aren’t bad—they are just silly. More powerful than humans because they can change their shape and appearance.



A little more on cows. Cows are sacred in their importance. In the old days, when a dispute was settled, a cow was offered as a gift. Cows provide milk, value as a farm animal, their dung is insulation, their urine is a cleaning agent. As well, their urine is still valued in making medicines—as it has been for 3-4,000 years. A cow is not eaten—it must be cremated. It is bad luck to have a cow die on you (plus you have to pay for the cremation), so many people turn them loose. That is why there are street cows everywhere—even walking down the middle of busy highways.

By the
Nandi
Cows are associated with Hinduism. This one is third biggest in India.
way, the language spoken in this region is Kannada—pronounced just the way you would think.

A note about security around here. We go through scanners everywhere—monuments, public buildings and even our hotels. Often, we go through a scanner, our bags so through a scanner and then we get “wanded” and/or patted down. Women go through a separate scanner and female attendants frisk us behind a closed curtain. Takes a long time.

The British gave India a postal system and an educational system, but they also left them with a crazy bureaucracy. I learned that when I got my Indian visa in Ottawa—that was just frustrating! One incident here was at a high end hotel in Jaipur. This was the day I got up at 3:15 am to catch a 6 am flight to southern India. I handed in my room key and was handed a customer service questionnaire. It was a full page of fine print that appeared to cover every detail of the last few days. I wasn’t in the best mood, and really wanted a coffee. I pushed it back and said, “no, everything was just fine.” They asked me to just put my name and
Street Cows
But then there are street cows like this one. They are everywhere, cars just swerve around them.
room number. I scribbled that and handed it back. They said that I had to fill it out. I said that I didn’t have my reading glasses—I really wanted that cup of coffee and remember, it is four o’clock in the morning. They suggested that I just check off everything in the “excellent” column. I took the form and when they weren’t looking, I hid it under a plant. Even the street cows don’t have this hassle.



Namaste!

Gokarna-en route
Un deguisement pour mendier
9 Mars 2012, Gokarna, Karnataka

Namasté!

On a terminé notre semaine à Palolem avec un verre de vin rouge indien. C’était disons… correct. Le clou de ma soirée a plutôt été la comparaison entre notre guide Lonely Planet et celui de nos voisins israéliens, rédigé en hébreu. C’est fascinant comme écriture! Ils écrivent de la droite vers la gauche, sens également dans lequel on tourne les pages. Par conséquent, la page couverture se trouve où le verso de nos livres. Et comme ils écrivent de la droite vers la gauche, leur alphabet semble à l’envers du nôtre, comme un effet miroir. L’effet est d’autant plus saisissant quand il y a des illustrations, leur sens commun contrastant avec notre perception inverse de l’écriture. Une lutte pour le cerveau, je vous jure… Bref, si vous avez la chance de feuilleter un livre en hébreu, faites-le, c’est bien meilleur qu’un verre de vin indien!

On a quitté Palolem en bus pour Gokarna, 60km plus bas sur la côte. C’était un bus local, dans lequel nous avons débuté notre chemin debout dans l’allée. Je regrettais de ne pas avoir mis mes bas de pantalons. Moi qui me disais que je passerais inaperçue
Gokarna
Temple en face de mon Guesthouse
parce que je serais assise, je me suis retrouvée avec 25 paires de yeux braqués sur mes genoux. Mes shorts ne sont même pas ‘’shorts’’ !! Des vraies shorts de brousse je vous dis… Même Angelina Jolie n’aurait pas l’air sexy avec ça sur le dos! Mais bon. On apprend. Mais n’empêche que je trouvais mes shorts moins dérangeantes que l’odeur des poissons que vendait une madame DANS la bus, et qu’un monsieur juste à côté de moi a acheté! On peut arrêter de regarder, mais pas de respirer quand même! Blague à part, je respecte leur culture et le code vestimentaire qui vient avec, et pour préserver une harmonie avec mes hôtes, je me promène désormais en jupe longue jusqu’aux chevilles!

Gokarna est une toute petite ville très charmante et très tranquille, perdue au cœur d’une forêt de palmiers, entre deux plages. Il y a des temples partout, dont un devant et derrière notre Guesthouse. Plusieurs fois par jour et à diverses endroits de la ville, ils y sonnent des cloches dans une mélodie digne du film ‘’7 ans au Tibet’’. Vous voyez le genre? C’est hypnotisant! L’atmosphère particulièrement spirituelle qui y règne est très calme et sereine,
Gokarna
Un chariot pour des processions vers un temple
et elle attire une grande population de rastas occidentaux de tous les styles : colorés, dans la barbe, la moitié du coco, jusqu’aux fesses, etc. Au moins 2/3 des touristes ont des rastas!

On a ensuite pris un bus de nuit avec couchette pour Hampi, au centre du Karnataka. Le sommeil n’a pas été des plus réparateurs, l’état des routes nous faisant parfois sauter jusqu’à 3’’ au-dessus du matelas! À notre agréable surprise, les couchettes sont doubles ce qui permet de passer le trajet collée sur son amoureux. Ce qui doit être moins agréable si vous voyagez seul, parce que vous devrez partager votre couche avec un étranger du même sexe!

À notre arrivée, une surprise nous attendait à Hampi: le festival Holî, dite la fêtes des couleurs! Je termine avec une photo de moi pour vous donner avant-goût du festival, alors que les détails suivront dans la prochaine chronique, même Bat-Heure, même Bat-Chaîne!

Halebid-2
Al naar (slechte) gewoonte, blijft de laatste blog-episode verweesd achter in een ‘pending file’😞

Het goede nieuws is dan weer dat de publicatie van het slot van de vorige reis doorgaans het voorteken is van een volgend project 😊.

Inderdaad, maar hierover later meer…



Eerst onze laatste dagen Zuid-India.




Vrijdag 02/03/12 – van Mysore naar Hassan


Vandaag rijden we van Mysore naar Hassan, een handige basis waaruit we de wondermooie tempels van Belur en Halebid, en de bedevaartsoord Sravanabelagola zullen verkennen.



Eerst een beetje relaxen in de weelderige ‘gemanicuurde’ tuinen met azuurblauw zwembad van het Hoysala Villlage Resort . Toegegeven, dit is er wat over, maar uiterst genietbaar! … en het restaurant is navenant 😊




Zaterdag 03/03/12 – Belur, Halebid en Sravanabelagola


De Hoysala tempels van Halebid (Halebeedu) en Belur (Beluru) vertegenwoordigen, samen met Somnathpur, zowat het hoogtepunt van een van de meest artistiek-exuberante periode in de ontwikkeling van de oude Hindoe-cultuur.

Architectonisch worden ze beschouwd als de Zuid-Indiase tegenhanger van Khajuraho in Madhya Pradesh en Konark bij Puri in Odisha (Orissa).

Het beeldhouwwerk is zo verfijnd dat het wel
Halebid-7
kant lijkt... ware stenen gedichten ter ere van de Hindoegoden... en ter verheerlijking van de (aardse?) vrouw

De bouw van het Channakeshava Tempel in Belur werd aangevat in de 12de eeuw A.D., meer dan 200 jaar voor de start van de constructie van de OLV-kathedraal van Antwerpen

Het Hoysaleswara Temple in Halabid dateert uit dezlfde periode, maar werd nooit volledig afgewerkt. Het blijft echter een toonbeeld van de Hoysala-architectuur.

Op weg naar Bengaluru houden we nog even halte in het bedevaartsoord Sravanabelagola.

De blootvoetse steile beklimming van de 614 treden leiden ons naar een kale heuveltop waarop een het 17,5m hoge monolithisch beeld van de naakte Jain-godheid Gomateshvara in alle sereniteit mediteert. De eenvoud van dit kunstwerk uit de 10de eeuw A.D. staat in schril contrast met de gekunsteldheid van beeldhouwwerk dat we deze ochtend nog bewonderden in Belur & Halebid.

Een laatste rustpunt voor we ons weer storten in het chaos van Bengaluru (Bangalore) op weg terug naar huis.

Grijze langoer
onderweg naar Mysore



Maandag 27/02/2012 – van Kochi naar Conoor

Lange transferdag (geen foto's).

We ruilen de broeioven (rond 40°C !) voor de veel koelere Nilgiriheuvels (Conoor ligt op ± 1.850m).



Wanneer je de grote baan van Kochi naar Mettupalayam (Coimbatore) volgt, waan je je midden in een XXXL Lifestyle magazine : gigantische billboards - soms wel een voetbalveld groot !!!) met reclame voor luxeproducten ontnemen je elk zicht op het landschap. Je rijdt als het ware van de ene bladzijde naar de andere...



Gelukkig stopt deze publicitaire overdaad aan de grens met Tamil Nadu, waar dit soort extravaganza - gelukkig - ietwat aan banden wordt gelegd, zodat we velden, dorpen en bossen weer kunnen zien...



In Conoor is niet zoveel te beleven, maar het is onze opstapplaats naar Udhagamandalam (Ooty).













Dinsdag 28/02/2012 – per 'Toy Train' van Conoor naar Ooty



Onze trein vertrekt pas in de late namiddag. Ondertussen gaan we op verkenning in de Nilgiris'Hills, gelegen op het drielandenpunt tussen Tamil Nadu, Kerala en Karnataka.



Van op de
Nilgiris Hills-7
Telescoop House op de Dodabetta (2.880 m - het hoogste punt van Zuid-India) heb je een quasi 360° panorama over de Eastern - en (voornamelijk) de Werstern Ghats. Belangrijkste activiteit : poseren voor de foto!





Door het meer gematigd klimaat op deze hoogtes, vind je hier op deze groene heuvels zowat 27%!v(MISSING)an de flora van India en 60%!v(MISSING)an de medicinale planten in het land.



Theeplantages en tuinbouw vormen hier het gros van de locale economie.



De Toy Train

Iets dat je hier absoluut niet mag missen is een ritje met de 'Toy Train'.

De 'Nilgiri Mountain Railway' is samen met de 'Daejeeling Himalayan Railway' (in het Noordoosten van India), door UNESCO uitgeroepen tot Werelderfgoed.



De oorspronkelijke Zwitserse koolgestookte stoomlocomotieven dateren uit de periode 1918-1920 en werden aangevuld in 1949-1950. Ze worden thans stilaan vervangen door nieuwe oliegestookte Indische exemplaren gebouwd naar het oorspronkelijk model (de 2de werd op 27/02/2012 geleverd in Coimbatore).



Omwille van de helling en het feit dat op het laatste segment geen tandrad systeem aanwezig is, wordt voor het traject Conoors - Ooty gebruik gemaakt van
Nilgiris Hills-1
een diesellocomotief.



Het treintje slingert zich tussen de bossen. Even wordt erg warm wanneer we door een licht uit de hand gelopen bermbrand moeten. Over deze brandjes is, in de volgende dagen, een hele polemiek ontstaan, zeker wanneer het 'Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve - een verzameling beschermde zones en Nationale Parken - getroffen hebben.

Volgens de locale kranten staat vast dat ze door mensen zijn aangestoken, maar nopens de doelstelling lopen er verschillende hypothesen (van gecontroleerd, om een ziekte uit te roeien, tot puur vandalisme...)



Hoe dan ook, de treinrit is erg genietbaar.









Woensdag 29/02/2012 – van Ooty naar Mysore



Onze weg naar Mysore leid ons door de 'Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve', want je moet door het Bandipur National Park.

Opeenvolgende (stevige) verkeersdrempels moeten snelheid ontraden, maar gewone verkeersborden zijn ontoereikend om het wild getoeter in te perken. Veel wild is er dan ook langs de weg niet te zien. Hoewel : we worden getrakteerd op enkele Indische olifanten(Elephas maximus indicus), chitals of Axisherten (Axis axis), hoelmans of grijze langoeren of ook nog Hanumanlangoer (Semnopithecus entellus), enkele makaken (Macaca radiata), en wat wilde zwijnen... (nog altijd beter dan in het Periyar N.P. !)



Nilgiris Hills-2




Donderdag 01/03/2012 – Mysore



In Mysore knopen we weer aan met het verkeerschaos en het concert van toeters en claxons...



Ons Hotel belooft ons een onneembaar zicht op de grandeur van Mysore Palace, vanop het dakterras... maar weelderige bomen steken daar - letterlijk - een stokje voor... Gelukkig zijn de bomen prachtig...



Mysore Palace

Dit fantastisch paleis, de voormalige zetel van de Wodeyar maharajas, hoort bij de fraaiste koninklijke gebouwen van India.

Het oude paleis werd door brand vernietigd in 1897; het huidige werd afgewerkt in 1912, en is het werk van de Engelse architect Henry Irwin.



Het interieur van dit Indo-Saraceense pracht – een caleidoscoop van glasramen, spiegels en weelderige kleuren – is ongetwijfeld (zwaar) 'over the top'. Het decor is verfraaid met gesculpteerde deuren - in hout of zelfs zilver - mozaïek vloeren en een reeks muurschilderingen die het 'dagelijks' leven in Mysore ten tijde van de Raj afbeelden.

Helaas is fotograferen hier ook verboden (maar dank zij internet kan je hier een volledige rondgang volgen).



Elke zon- en feestdag wordt het gebouw opgeluisterd door ruim 100.000
Nilgiris Hills-6
gloeilampen, alsof het Kerstmis is. (Dat hebben we gemist!, maar je kan altijd hier een kijkje nemen)

The hut
One of the (pretty much) two things I did in Goa - read. The other one was swim.
Namaste!



Ah, here I am again, nearly 2 years later – in an internet cafe, this time in South India rather than the Himalayas, but with that same awful feeling in my stomach, knowing I will shortly be boarding a plane that takes me away from a place I love and have come to regard as home (or wishfully regard as home). I'm not quite as inconsolable as I was last time (although talk to me later when I am actually ON that plane – I've already told Mom to have the tissues ready) but I am still feeling absolutely wretched and sad. I think the difference this time is that I have been able to come back – I know that it is possible, that India still exists for me and will be waiting whenever I am ready and able to return.

Thankfully, our time in Goa ended relaxingly, although we didn't get much sleep the last two nights we were there because we were so edgy about the break-in. We just sort of hung around, kept laying on the beach, and kept eating good food, soaking up the blissful sunshine because we knew we would

soon be arriving back in wintry Canada. In the end I did like Goa a fair bit, mostly for gastronomic reasons, and it was amazing to unwind and have my major accomplishment for the day be that I swam out to a big rock about 300 metres from shore (seriously, this is a conversation I had with Steven, a nice Irish man I met: “Well what did you do today Shannon?” “I swam to the big rock and then I bought a dress.” “Well there you go! That's something isn't it!” with all the enthusiasm as if I had told him that I single-handedly performed sterilization operations on all of the stray dogs in India (which needs to be done anyways)). Life moves at a different pace in Goa, a slow, contemplative and melodic pace, and it is easy to see why so many Europeans have made it their permanent home, opening up restaurants and buying retirement property there – like a way-cooler Fort Lauderdale or something.

The train from Goa to Hampi was so full of foreigners that the beggars who routinely come by must have thought they'd hit the jackpot – on second thought, it is likely

the knowledge that this train will be shuttling between two mega-tourist hot spots that drew so many of them out. I generally ignore beggars or try to politely and sympathetically tell them no, because I don't want to contribute to the corrupt practice of mutilating children and exploiting them and I hope fervently that the Indian government eventually does something about this. Kids should be in school or playing, not on trains dressed up like clowns performing tricks down the aisle while their mother comes by with their infant siblings in her arms, asking for money. I've had to harden myself to this sight, the way most of us in the West change the channel whenever an advert comes on TV for starving children in Africa (we've all done it, I know) – if I didn't, I would not be able to survive life here. Poverty is a constant and tragic companion, yes, and I have the utmost compassion for every person who has ever asked me for money or some food (food I have given on occasion, if I had it with me), but if I fully allowed myself to acknowledge it and respond emotionally whenever it confronted me
Backstreet Goa
In a fancy dress
I would be crippled with the desire and inability to do anything about it. There was only one occasion where it really got to me – it was one of these circus-act children who came by, with the mother carrying the little baby behind, and after she walked by I got a good look at the little girl she was carrying. She was smiling, gurgling, and doing all those cute-8-month-old-baby things like trying to wriggle out of her mother's arms to get to me and smiling each time I smiled at her. Normally these babies lie all sad and listless in their mothers' arms, but this one was active and engaging, and for me there was more tragedy in that – her spirit was so alive and so palpable and I knew, but she didn't yet, that she probably had a life ahead of her much like her older brother's, that was going to be unimaginably challenging and destructive. I completely broke down and started bawling into my scarf and faced the window while Mom patted me on my leg and I tried not to call too much attention to myself, but it was hard. Unfortunately, when travelling here, and
Hampi Carvings
Oh you know, just some seriously amazing 15th-century carvings
anywhere that poverty exists so overtly, you have to confront the reality that the majority of people in this world live with in a way that you don't have to back at home, where you can change the channel whenever you are faced with something that makes you feel uneasy. It's good though, it is part of what makes the experience what it is, and I am glad that I get to see things that otherwise I wouldn't – it has opened me up in certain ways and has made the experience what it is.

Hampi's weather was a lot more pleasant this time around, all sun-shiny and hot, and since I am no longer recovering from dengue fever I had a lot more energy to do things. In a moment where she must have taken leave of her senses, Mom displayed tremendous trust in her daughter's assurances that she knew how to ride a scooter and we rented one for the day, me driving and Mom on the back. She did tell me as we were hitting around 20 km per hour that that was my speed limit, but as the bike didn't go much faster there wasn't
More intricacy...
It was so beautiful!
much to worry about there – the only thing that was slightly dismaying about the bike was the horn; it sounded like a pathetic whisper which is NOT what you want your horn to sound like in India on these roads. You want a horn that goes “HEY MOVE OUTTA THE WAY I'M COMING YOU BETTER MOVE YOUR ASS OR ELSE I'LL RUN IT OVER!”. Our horn was like a little goat bleating “um, pardon me, I'm right behind you, excuse me, if you just wouldn't mind maybe perhaps shuffling over slightly so I could try to make my way through, I would really appreciate it.” So brutal! But we survived and got to see even more amazing ruins than I saw last time which was great, and I didn't have to use the self-timer on my camera because Mom took a bunch of photos! Yay!

We took our final (and, like, 10th) sleeper train to Bangalore and I am seriously going to miss those trains! But again, I am secure in the knowledge that India and I are not done with each other and I will be back again, hopefully sooner rather than later, and again hopefully able
Hardcore
Yup, doesn't get much more badass than cut-off sleeves, big sunglasses, and a bike that doesn't go more than 34 km per hour... and a popsicle.
to contribute something to the people here that I care so much about.

I arrived in India this time almost a little desperate to be back, not really believing it could be possible, running full-tilt, and found myself smack in the middle of mayhem in Delhi, kind of going “What the hell did I get myself into? Delhi isn't Kerala! Who are all these people constantly asking me to 'Please Madam come look my shop'?” Then I got dengue fever, then lice, then Delhi belly, then all these little things that can wear on the spirit happened and I was stuck in this enormous city of 16 million people – and I don't even LIKE cities! But slowly slowly, I met the people that made the experience what it was and was shattered when I had to leave Delhi and the kids I was working with and the little peaceful enclaves I found there. I then did something that for me (who has happily worked multiple jobs in the past while simultaneously doing a Master's degree, a time in my life that I wouldn't necessarily want to repeat but which is indicative of my tendency to take on a
Hampi beauty
Dancing maidens, camels, elephants...
LOT, sometimes more than is healthy to handle) was incredibly decadent and lazy and spent a month on the beach, recovering from dengue and doing some much-needed introspection and work on myself. Travelling with Mom has exceeded any and all expectations I may have had about the experience and I am almost unspeakably happy that we got to share this together.

That being said... there are a tremendous lot of people I need to thank for making my time here what it was. I am definitely going to leave out some (inadvertently, so I apologize) but I would like every single person who I spent any time with here and interacted with in any way to know that without you, this experience could not possibly be what it was and I would not have been where I am right now, near tears and aghast with gratitude and love. Aaron, thank you for taking care of me while I had dengue after only knowing me for 4 days and for having such an open heart – you are truly one of the best people I have ever met, and that's that. Wolle, Joern and Sebastien, thank you for welcoming me
Hampi views
Sigh.
into your flat and making me a part of the family – it gave me such a sense of security in Delhi and contributed in a huge way to me ending up loving the city. Robyn and Tom in Hampi, thank you for taking me out to breakfast on my birthday – it was such a small kindness but an example of where something small means a lot, and I am very grateful that I met you when and where I did! Pashupatti, thank you for being an incredible example of the kind of person I aspire to be – you are so real and so honest, I could spend a lifetime learning from you and be nowhere close to where you are! The Kudle crew (Maddie, Gioele, Pradeep, Lorin, Jason, Chris, Ollie, Marcus, Nick, etc...) – thank you for creating a community for me there, it was just one of the best times I have ever had and would have been nowhere near as good without each of your personalities! Kelly and Barry, you are some of the best people I have spent time with on my travels, thank you for befriending us on that backwaters trip and sharing
Cantaloupe!
Melon - the dumbest thing to eat on the train. It's a pain in the ass to prepare anyway, let alone with a swaying train to mix things up a bit.
the beach in Varkala, I swear I will get to the UK someday and come see you! Kim in Jaipur, thank you for having girlfriend time with me, I needed that at that point. Tomas in Varanasi, you are one of the most stellar spirits I have ever met – thank you for your beautifully kind words as I was leaving, I feel like I've known you much longer than 36 hours as well and I'll see you in Canada for some hiking and being overly polite! Damien and Rhoda in Darjeeling, you made amazing company while we were there – thank you for travelling with us as well, I know you are picky about who you spend your time with hahaha! Tom in Goa – another amazing short but sweet adventure, kayaking and sunset boat rides, thank you for responding the way you did when I gave you a compliment; it reminds me of why I need to continue to tell people positive things about themselves!

Mom – thank you for coming. These 2 months have cemented themselves in my mind and heart as some of the best moments of my life. The fact that we got to
Love!
Mother-daughter henna :)
do this together speaks to the strength of our relationship, which I value more than anything, and the strength of your spirit, which I have always been aware of and have always admired. You have shown SUCH an admirable amount of patience and tolerance with me and a spirit of adventure that has been invaluable during our time together! If I can be half as strong as you when I am your age I will consider myself lucky. You are a perfect example of the woman I hope to become someday, and I think I am probably the most fortunate daughter out there because of it.

Finally, India. Thank you. That is all I have to say, it is all I can say. You are more than a country and a place to visit, you are something to be felt and heard and tasted and absorbed, a feeling and an energy, a state of mind and an openness of heart. I would not, in a million years, trade one single moment I have had here for anything else in the world, even the moments where I was frustrated and cursing you, for it was these moments that made the moments where I felt my spirit lifted up all worth it, and ever so much sweeter. You have changed me utterly and irreversibly, and I hope someday to return and continue to grow here. I owe so much to you, and I know this is starting to sound like I am writing to a lover, but in a way... I don't know! I am so in love with India that it is hard to make it sound any differently! Just thank you, from the bottom of my heart and soul.

And with that, I board this plane, taking me back to snowy Canada and medical school interviews (wishmeluckwishmeluckwishmeluck!) and “real life” to be a “real person” (to use Ms. Pauline Beaupre's expression) – but always India will be in my heart, in my mind, and I have no fear now that I will not be back, because India is inside of me. I have sweet memories and Indian warmth in my soul, and always, always, spicy love in my heart.

Badami to Bidar


Gol Gumbaz
Bijapur
I was roused from sleep by the call to prayer this morning there are few things more exotic in my opinion or annoying if you are trying to sleep in. The shower doesn’t work so a wet one bath was all I could tolerate, we left Badami after another crap breakfast of tiny pieces of toast and tea and headed further north to the predominantly Islamic city of Bijapur the former seat of the Adil Shahi kings (1489 - 1682).

This crazy Indian practice of laying speed humps across the highways every bloody kilometre turned a reasonably short drive into a much longer one, but we arrived around 11.30am and stopped on the edge of the city to admire the Malik-E-Maidan or in English the Monarch of the Plain an extremely large 55 tonne canon left to rust on one of the cities external walls before looking for a decent hotel room. I then accompanied Padraic to the basement restaurant where we consumed a spicy lunch consisting of chilli and other stuff before visiting some amazing Islamic fortifications, mosques, palaces and mausoleums.

The first place we visited was the incredible Ibrahim Rouza built in 1580 by the Emperor Abdil
Malik-E-Maidan or The Monarch of the Plains
Bijapur
Shah 2 for his queen unfortunately he died first and was interred there. We then visited the graceful arches of the Bara Kaman an unfinished mausoleum followed by the interesting Jod Gumbad tombs all of which share the architectural grace common to Islamic constructs.

We then visited the 1557 Jama Majid which must have once been amazing but is now falling into disrepair and finally the richly decorated gateway known as Mihtar Mahal.

The highlight of our visit to Bijapur will be the Gol Gumbaz, a mausoleum built in 1659 which stands seven metres high and has a 38 metre dome second only to St Peters in Rome. The building is supposed to have superb acoustics so we are going there early in the morning to avoid the crowds to check this out.

Yes the Gol Gumbaz does have excellent acoustics I could hear the Russian tourists making silly noises from every direction at once. I took a few dawn photos of the tomb before returning to the hotel for breakfast. The Gol Gumbaz is such a massive building for one long dead man while millions of Indians live in hovels, go figure.

After breakfast we

Bijapur
headed to the fortified town of Bidar another Indian city dominated by Islam and the home of a supposedly excellent 15 century fort I say supposedly because it was closed for maintenance when we arrived in late afternoon and wasn’t open in the morning when we again attempted to enter.

We travelled to Bidar via the town of Gulburga another town dominated by Islam visiting some impressive tombs, the ceiling of one was decorated in mirror tiles and was an incredibly gaudy sight.

I met a little girl probably twelve or thirteen years old at the Bidar Fort who had very good English and was visiting from Hyderabad, she was with a man older than me and a number of other children when I asked her if the man was her father he answered saying she was his wife. India is a paradise for paedophiles it seems.

We have decided to visit an impact crater at a place called Lonar which is in Maharashtra state, so early the next morning we started driving, after about two hours the driver started babbling about border taxes, unfortunately at the border there was no tax office so after much stuffing
Ibrahim Roza
Bijapur
around we had to spend another couple of hours and many more kilometres finding one. Eventually late in the day we pulled into another nondescript ugly Indian town called Beed where we stayed in the only hotel we could find.

Hampi To Badami


Virupaksha Temple
Pattadakal World Heritage Site
India can be difficult place in which to travel, the dirt and the filth becomes depressing so I ensure that I bathe every evening no matter the water temperature. I can’t ever remember being so consistently filthy anywhere I have previously travelled.

Next morning after another poor attempt at an edible breakfast we hit the road stopping briefly to look at an interesting temple in Hospet before negotiating about three hours of bad roads before eventually stopping briefly at a dodgy looking road side diner for a surprisingly cold Sprite and to watch a few minutes of the cricket on the beat up TV in the corner.

It was then on to Aihole pronounced Ay-hol-eh where we would see some stunning 6th century temples, Padraic says we should have started here and travelled south as the temples are getting progressively older as we continue further north. The Durga Temple and the Museum were the highlights at Aihole and in particular the precinct where the temples were much simpler and more solid looking then later architectural designs.

From Aihole it was only a few kilometres to the World Heritage listed Pattadakal complex which was once a capital of the
Durga Temple
Aihole
Chalukyas empire and has temples dating back as far as the 3rd century. It was an amazing complex although it was extremely hot and dusty; I was initially in my element.

A world heritage site and only a small crowd of visitors how refreshing, until they all began following me around, I couldn’t escape them. Every time I turned around there were at least thirty people following me, Padaic thought it was hilarious, eventually I agreed to a few photos with their kids and they left me alone.

From here we headed to Badami along a rough road where we would spend the night, stopping briefly at a very old Jain Temple which had fantastic carved elephant heads on each side of the entrance. Badami is an attractive shady town located in a canyon encircled by forts and old temples decorating the cliff tops. The down also has the lovely Agastyatirtha tank with the gorgeous Bhutanatha Temple jutting out from its shore but the real attraction here are the caves.

The caves are early fifth century rock cut temples containing superb carvings of Hindu and Jain deities. I have always had a passion for rock cut cave
Gandar and Ladkhan Temples
Aihole
temples and would have enjoyed these more if not for the large crowds swarming all over the place.

There are four caves the first about ten metres up the rock cut stairs carved into the cliff, these stairs then continue to the other three caves about fifty metres further up, as I climbed up the stairs to the third cave I was surround by about forty school children all clapping and cheering me, I have no idea why, I was somewhat embarrassed and extremely confused.

After the caves I walked around the tank visiting the old temples, near the Bhutanatha Temple I was attacked (again) by Macaques and this time they weren’t intimidated, I had to go get a security guard, as they were surrounding me the little hairy bastards.

I was going to visit the museum but some kid was defecating in the entrance way so I wandered off into Badami's attractive old town, Indians shit and piss anywhere they please, while we were enjoying our breakfast this morning five little girls climbed the fence and all defecated near one of temples on Hemakuta Hill in Hampi, so much for world heritage protection.

A stunning elephant drawn carriage
Vittala Temple
The stunning city of Vijayanager is the capital of the destroyed Vijayanagara Empire is a showcase of fine medieval Indian architecture and a UNESCO World Heritage site. The city was around 26 square kilometres and was encircled by seven levels of defensive walls many of which can still be seen.

Our guest house is located within metres of the older temples on Hemakuta Hill, which we visited immediately after Virupaksha Temple, which dominates the small village and traveller enclave of Hampi Bazarre. I particularly like the older temples dating from the 9th century strewn amongst the boulder dominated terrain.

We visited a number of smaller temples many of these were dominated by large effigies of various gods including Ganesh, before striking of down a dirt track with the plan of looping back around to some of the other major sites. The scenery was extremely attractive as we followed the course of a canal identifying and photographing temples standing starkly on hill sides or buried in the undergrowth. Unfortunately we couldn’t find the path that lead to the river and the sun was setting so we had to turn around and walk all the way back. From here we grabbed

a rickshaw and went to a village four kilometres away where we had a few beers before returning to Hampi for dinner (no booze in Hampi).

Saturday dawned hot and cloudless (when is it anything else) so we headed out to the Royal Enclosure visiting major sites such as the Queens Bath and Zenana Enclosure and the beautiful Lotus Mahal. We then checked out the brilliant Elephant Stables, The Barracks and many more ruins. There were few people about so we wandered at will for several hours, it is a shame Indians don’t value these monuments as they scrawl graffiti on everything and throw rubbish all over the place, still we saw some fantastic architectural sites in that morning.

Around 10.30am we arrived at Shiva’s Underground Temple where the driver was waiting and he showed us an ancient military dining area where a long line of plates had been carved into some rocks near an aqueduct. Before taking us to the museum where there was a large model of Vijayananagar, we were able to see how close we had come the night before to a major road. The museum was surprisingly good, we then headed to the fabulous
Virupaksha Temple
Hampi Bazaar
Vittala Temple where we the left the driver and set off on foot.

This temple was built in the 15th century and looks fantastic sandwiched between rocky ridges and the river. The highlight of this complex was the magnificent carved chariot in the courtyard. We ate a couple of ice creams to try and combat the heat before followed the beautiful Tungabadhra River back towards Hampi Bizarre. We could see many of the Anegondi Temples across the river as we stopped at a restaurant for a meal and a cold drink.

Bangalore to Kundapura
Bus trip from Bangalore to Kundapura and return. Local day trip by bus from Kundapura to Udupi, autorickshawto Malpe and by boat to St. Mary's Islands.

There is something very strange about beach destinations. I used to wonder,what do all these people do when they stay near the beach? Of course, there is the sea and you go for a dip, but the charm runs out after a couple of hours and then what next? With hill destinations, I get it. There is driving, hiking up and enjoying the view from the top. This was until the trip to Agonda in south Goa. For three days it was nothing but eat-swim-relax-sleep-drink-swim-relax routine and by the end I had attained complete nirvana. It was about rediscovering myself. For one, the vast expanse of the ocean and the power of nature puts things in perspective about the connection between us humans and nature. Second, doing nothing is actually a good way to think through things, relax and make decisions about life. It was a completely different experience for a person like me who always has to have something to think about.

Thirdly, enough with the philosophical bullshit. I'll come to the trip I took with my wife, Pavi.

I had booked a round trip non A/C sleeper bus ticket from Bangalore to Kundapura by Karnatake State Road
View of the coast from the resort
Transport Corporation KSRTC (Rupees 400/person one way). The bus that we were supposed to travel in had had a breakdown and we were bumped up to A/C semi-sleeper bus after an hour of waiting. We were pretty tired and slept as soon as the bus took off. The bus takes the popular Bangalore-Mangalore highway through Hassan and reached Mangalore the next morning. From Mangalore the bus travels northwards to Udupi, the popular temple town, and as soon as we reached Udupi, the air was waft with the smell of the sea (fish, to be precise!). The next stop would be Kundapura about 90kms from Mangalore. Kundapura is a small non-descript town but is well connected on the West coast highway. We got down at the bus stop and hired an autorickshaw (tuk-tuk) and were charged Rupees 250 to take us the 12kms to the Turtle Bay beach resort. I had made a reservation online for a small standard room (Rupees 1000/night) for two days, but when we got there we were told that the rooms were unavailable as the people staying there had extended the stay.The lady at the reception told us that they can give us a cottage room
Entrance of the resort from the beach
right next to the beach for 2000 rupees/night. The room was clean and laid artistically with typical village style windows (check out the pics) and a cement slab cot. It was neat and comfortable and with the sound of the waves crashing against the rocks on the coast, heavenly. The property's USP is the presence of rock boulders on the coast with crevices big enough for a person to walk-in and the resort is surrounded by fishing hamlets with boats neatly laid out. The fishermen take the boats out in the night for a catch and sell it in the nearby towns. A picture perfect place to relax for the weekend. We took a dip in the sea, had food and beer. The food was not quite to our taste, but the beer was heavenly as it always is near the sea.

The second day, we decided to explore the place and headed towards Udupi and Malpe. We walked the kilometre from the beach to the bus stop and took the local bus to Udupi (Rupees 30 one way). Once there, we took the autorickshaw to Malpe, 6kms from Udupi. We got a ferry ticket to St. Mary's Islands
Another view of the coast from the resort
which is about 6kms from Malpe. After a 30min wait, the boat finally arrived and boarded 50 souls to be taken to St. Mary's Islands. The islands are made of volcanic rock formation with the rock arranged neatly like a column. The island coast is madeup of shells and not sand as I had assumed. What lies beneath the coastline - rock, shells or sand, I am unsure. I gathered that the formation of the island is geographically unique and resembles the Giant's causeway in Ireland. We explored the place and took a short dip in the water as it was crowded in the weekend. The view of the island and coast from the topmost part of the island was enchanting. We then took the ferry back to Malpe and the tuk-tuk to Udupi, had a short look at the temple and the famous decorated idol of Lord Krishna. We could not see the idol as the Lord had taken time off for a shower, and so settled to shop for some beads (Pavi is crazy about beads) in the little shops that line almost every temple in India. We then took the local bus back to the resort, had
Volleyball nets outside the resort
food and drink and spent the remained of the day relaxing.

The third day was spent relaxing with usual food-drink-dip-sleep-food routine and that evening we headed back to the KSRTC depot in Kundapura to take the bus back to Bangalore. One tip that I learnt was that it is better to take a semi-sleeper bus (like the seats in an aeroplane) when traveling through hilly terrain as the position is good for sleeping. Full sleeper buses tend to rock front-to-back and can be quite merciless onthe neck.

On the whole, a very relaxing long weekend.

The slum
by Polona

After staying in Varkala for more than we intended (don't get me wrong, I am NOT complaining 😊) we finally got off our butts, packed our backpacks (again) and off we were to the train station on our way to Alappuzha or Alleppey, as they call it.

Alappuzha is one of the spots where you can do boat tours around the backwaters and discover the numerous canals. They call Alappuzha the “Indian Venice”. I guess the similarities are there – people living surrounded by water, there are no roads, all the traffic takes place on the water, but I suppose that's where it ends. Yes, Venice are smelly too, but you can hardly say the smells are the same. You would understand if you have been there 😊. You can take a whole day trip around the river canals (but it does get slightly boring after a couple of hours), people also do tours that take days, hiring houseboats (beautiful and luxurious boats, with 2 or more rooms on the boat, but trust my word when I say the luxury costs as well).

We arrived to Alleppey in the afternoon, so we decided to go round
Backwaters
town a little bit, do the backwaters the next day, and than leave for Gokarna. One thing I will definitely remember Alleppey for is The Great Battle – namely the battle between us and the really huge, humongous mosquitoes. I swear, they were huge, I have never seen mosquitoes this size. And there were gazillions of them. Jan and I just sat in front of our room, when they attacked, biting us even through our clothes. So it started, we were clapping our hands like idiots, killing as many as possible, but they had amazing back up, and it was 2 of us against an army of them. We did not falter though, and the pile of dead mosquitoes around our seats was getting bigger and bigger, but so was the number of new arrivals. So for 2 evenings straight, we were fighting for our mere existence. There was this Indian guy watching us and he said: “Mosquitoes, ha? Yeah, they come in the evening, many of them. And they like your pale skin.” And then he laughed and left, leaving me thinking I should of done a better effort of tanning my pale, white skin. 😊

The next
One of many victims
morning we went to town, as we were told it is best to look for and hire a boat by yourself than to have an agency organise your trip around the backwaters. So we found this guy, who was offering us a motor boat for a decent price, but once we got to the boat, we saw he was just the middle man. He started fighting with the boatman and Jan assumed (correctly) they were fighting about how to share the money. So Jan took our money back from the middle man and we agreed for a different price with the boat man, and off we were. It was quite nice and to be honest, observing how the people live with the water was quite interesting. They do everything but cook with the river water. So we saw many people bathing and washing, women doing the laundry...It was also very quiet, because there is no traffic there, apart from boats. Our boat man tried to give us some information about the backwaters, but after an hour or so, he kept repeating himself up to a point, when Jan and I could hardly stay serious any more. We also made a
No clue what it is?
Maybe a durian?
quick stop at his house, where his wife prepared some chai for us. But that's when the guy started acting weird, he was all cocky, asking us same questions 6 or 7 times (how long will you stay in Alleppey, where are you going after...), it was very obvious he was trying to show his wife and mother (who joined us later), how cool he was. And also, I think he took something, cause it was all gibberish coming from his mouth. So you can imagine we were more than happy when our 3 hour tour around the backwaters was over and we were able to get away from the guy.

I can't remember when I was last so happy to leave a place, but I was thrilled when we left for another overnight train to Gokarna. As there was no direct train from Alleppey to Gokarna, we had to get off at an interim station of Kumta, at 3.30 in the morning. I have to say, I am starting to love the Indian trains. You could easily live there and lack nothing. There is always food available (fresh, as they have a huge kitchen on the train), you
A closer look at it
can get chai or coffee, snacks...And everything is so cheap. If you buy anything on trains around Europe, it always seems to cost a fortune. We got the side bunk beds, which were quite comfy, so it seemed like we arrived to Kumta in no time. As it was only 3.30 am, we slept on the train station and we woke up at about 7am, ready to continue our trip to Gokarna. When we stepped out of the station, we were like “What the hell?”, the area seemed so isolated, so quiet and so far away from any life. We walked to the road and asked around for the bus station. A guy just told us to wait at the side of the road, where we were picked up by a sleeper bus, on its way to Gokarna. An hour later, we were finally there.

Following Diego's recommendation we took a tuk tuk to the Om beach (it got its name following the fact that the beach is in shape of the Indian sign for “om”). The tuk tuk dropped us on the top of the cliff, so a flight of stairs later, we were on Om beach, looking
And a bit closer
for the Dolphin bay hostel. I was so tired and soooooo in need of a long shower that I was quite taken aback when I first saw the huts behind the Dolphin bay cafe. They were the simplest huts, put directly on the sand, with a bed occupying pretty much the whole room. Wow, I totally lost my spirit, whereas Jan loved it, there was this really easy going, nice group of people sitting in the sand around a huge round table, which was placed in the middle of the walking path, a row of about 6 huts on each side. Jan joined them, whereas I was fuming, so I took some me time, and went round the beach. When I came back, I was shown how the “shower” works (there was a huge tank of water, you had to drop your stuff in the so called bathroom, grab a bucket and fetch the water from the tanker). After a “shower” (the place had no running water), I felt a bit better and I started to absorb the feel of the Dolphin bay “slum” (I don't really know who came up with the “slum” thingy, but it was so right
The great battle
– basic huts, no running water and a bunch of hobbos 😊).

The first couple of days, we felt as if the slum was colonised by the French, pretty much everyone but us were French. But everyone was really nice so we felt like home very soon. Apart from walking to town one afternoon (climbing over a hill, walking over Cudly beach and walking over yet another hill – about an hour's walk), we didn't do much. Well, that's a lie, I walked to town and back again, as I managed to ruin one of our torch lights and lose another one, so with the daily power cuts in the slum, we really needed one.

Also, as Om beach is full of “free spirits” and new age hippies, it wasn't weird to see people doing yoga on the beach early in the morning. I must admit something: I became one of them. Following the yoga course we did in Varkala, I got into a habit of doing yoga every morning (still am, here in Goa), although I am not into the whole “spiritual crap”, I just like how my body feels after a full hour's stretching and bending.
Everyday life for some


Anyhow...after 2 days, we got new arrivals to the slum, that kinda became our own, non – French “posse”. A German girl called Anna, a couple from Sweden, Jonas and Helene, and the legendary couple from Yorkshire, now pretending to be Scottish, Julie and Steven. It was our posse versus the French contingency, fighting for our spot around the slum table. We would pretty much just sit there and chat, and thanks to Julie share some life wisdoms (for example why we should never have kids, as they are pretty much a waste of time 😊). Julie was the life of our posse, I really couldn't help but like her. The discussions we had...well, repeating stuff that was said or talked about just wouldn't do it justice. So, see Julie, you ARE mentioned in our blog, and you ARE still the QUEEN. 😊 Oh, and do say “hi” to Posh and Becks for us, and organise a small gathering. We will make sure we bring Tom and Katie. 😊. And Julie, please keep practicing and follow Anna's advice 😊 by Jan

Jan and I also got in a routine when it came to food. Lunch almost always consisted
Backwaters
of the huge and yummy Nutella pancakes. Erm, my figure is still long and lean, have no fear 😊.

Another thing that became pretty routine were the rats crawling round and in our huts at night...we became so annoyed with them, and having them on our bed one night, we slept the last night with our light on.

With all the delights and the easy going life we had in Gokarna, it was yet again time to move. With sad hearts we said farewell to our posse, and again, off we were, on our way to Goa. Oh, yeah...new age hippies, here we come!😊

Mysore to Hampi


Hoysaleswara Temple
Halebid
Another short drive as we arrived in the ancient city of Mysore around midday and dumped our bags at the hotel I had booked the previous evening, it is clean and comfortable and within just a few minutes’ walk of the palace. We decided that we would go visit the further afield sights immediately then dismiss the driver as we will be staying for a few days. The first of these sights was the star shaped Kesava Temple built 1268 in Somnathpur some thirty three kilometres east of Mysore, which was totally covered in carved soapstone figures from the Ramayana, Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita some quite pornographic. I found the temple fascinating, it's a shame the Indians don’t build anything so pretty anymore.

On the way back we visited the temple on Chamundi Hill not very interesting but the five metre carved statue of Nandi was interesting on the way down, we then went to a couple of expensive shops so the driver could get commissions, although he told us not to buy anything. The rest of the day was spent in a pub enjoying a few Kingfisher beers.

Tuesday morning I rose early as usual, my stomach
Keshava Temple
Somnathpur
is much better today although I may be getting Padraic's cold now, I have never seen anyone eat as much as him, he will eat anything and in huge quantities. I headed for the palace, I was harassed by children asking for money as I walked to the palace then by the police when I refused to check in my camera on arrival, they don’t seem to have anything useful to do, I no sooner entered the palace and the Indians are snapping everything in sight with their mobile phones. The Palace is century old and well worth a look, although it is gaudy and only a small portion is open to the public I then visited the shop where I purchased some souvenirs.

First stop this morning is Sriangapatnam a fort town built in the middle of the Cauvery River by Tipu Sultan who was killed in a war against the British in 1799, he built a summer palace in beautifully carved timber (Daria Daulat Bagh) only two kilometres from the Gumbaz (tomb) where his body is interred.

We then visited Sravanabelagola (Monk of the White Pond) a Jain pilgrimage town which is dominated by an eleven
Keshava Temple art
Somnathpur
hundred year old statue, 18 metre tall and perched on Vindhyagiri Hill, the statue was naked and his penis is about three feet long. The six hundred and fourteen steps to the top were a bit of an effort as the rock was hot and we had to go bare foot, the views were great from the top.

We then travelled to Hassan an unpleasant busy town where we stayed the night, I had to go see an Airtel vendor here to get some more credit on my phone then Padraic and I had a few beers and a meal.

The next morning we visited the Hoysala temples at Halebid and Belur, the Hoysala were the dominant Hindu empire in this part of India for a number of centuries managing to fight of the Muslims off for a number of years before eventually being defeated, they also built the Devala Temple at Somnathpur.

Of the two temples (both free entry) the Hoysaleswara (Halebid) Temple (1121) dedicated to Shiva was in my opinion the better, it was more intricately carved and the interior had bats and beautiful sculptures, there are also two large Nandi statues and a museum
Fantastic carving
Somnathpur
set in an attractive park near a lake. The Channakashava (Belur) temple dedicated to Vishnu took a century to build (1126) and is still a working temple with priests etc which is interesting, as were the other temples on the site, the tank and the well.

On the way back to Hassan we stopped at a resort for lunch and decide to stay there the night rather than return to that ugly town. I am sick again my second nasty cold since I have been in India, at least my stomach isn’t playing up today. We met our new driver Mani at the resort, the food here is great, I had a huge cooked breakfast before our departure to Hampi.

view from room
with some trepidation about landing on the hilltop in mangalore where sometime ago an air india flight had crashed, we arrived at mangalore airport, a newly built airport, collected our luggage and proceeded towards taj gateway. they offered us a choice of rooms and we were upgraded to a club room with a view of the arabian sea. we explored the hotel and discussed a day trip with travel desk. We arrived at the coffee shop and i chose a mangalore thali with the fish and chicken, my husband ordered a nasi goreng and after a little rest we left for sun and sand resort which was right on the beach. entry to the resort also came with snacks and we spent some time at the coffee shop overlooking the beach and viewed some of the rooms and then got into the water. there was a dog swimming in the sea and i must say he was such a powerful swimmer. we then left for someswara beach which was a rocky beach. we saw this beautiful sunset and returned to the hotel after a detour to see the docks.

Dinner was at the indian restaurant and we turned in early
